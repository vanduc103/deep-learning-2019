When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the clength of the clen.
My father hearing on his little road, women Radio the news of the bright of the BBC.
He looked very happy, very happy, very unusual, because of the neighborhood, most of the neighborhood.
He rule: "The Taliban are wrong!"
I didn't know what that means is, but it made my father, very happy.
"You can go on a right school," he said, "I'm going to go.
I'm going to be able to fix.
All right school.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I was both girls,
So I five years, I five years, I five years long as Junge, and I started my older, my older, not more of all, not more of the sky.
And so we could go to school.
Every day, we could never get another way, even never mandal, where we went to where we went to where we went.
We were able to buy our books income, so we could just look like this, and we just walked as we just walk a book.
And we were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 feet.
In the winter was, but incredible, but incredibly, it was incredibly hot.
We all know that we knew that we knew our lives: teachers and our parents and our parents.
And then the first time, the until the difference for a week, because the taliban powerful, because the taliban power.
We were never sure how much they knew about us.
Do they recorded us?
When do they know where we do?
We had angry, but we wanted to school.
I had lucky in a family to grow up in a family, and turned out of the picture.
My grandfather was his time.
At the outside of a provinced provinced Afghanistan. He was based on it -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- my father -- and it was dading.
My borders, but I was born, but I was teacher.
That's what it's.
And two years ago, they went to the rohest, just to our house for mouse and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this was the first -- the first in his family, who ever recognization.
For him, it was sound that his children would be a children, it would be a children, even his daughter, trots the Taliban, trots all risks.
He looked like a lot of greater Risko, his children don't go to school.
I know that I'm just sured out in the years, sometimes, sometimes, and sometimes of our lives, from our lives, from our lives,
I had good lusted to be able to live. But my father said, "Thatter, you can hear. You can lose your life.
His money can be carbon. You can be in the war, you can be done in the war.
But a thing that's going to be bad, and that's what's going to do with our blood, and even if we're going to be able to do with our bloods, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country on a country, the decades of war.
Less than 6 percent of my alters have a higher than the size of my alters as the secondarabluss. And when my family, and when my family, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm going to be here as a statement of the Middlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather, my grandfather, who was certainly because he was sended to school because he was a bad, he was a greater to school.
He doesn't just feeling with my high schools, but also I was the first woman I was the first woman who was the first woman who was fully.
My family believe me.
I have great deeply, but my family has larger animals for me.
So I'm a global both of global both for 1010, a world for 1010, a global campaign for the picture of women.
So I've been doing this, SOLALA, and maybe some internative internator for mice, and maybe a country, a country, a country, a country, in the school.
It's wonderful to see how the shoots of my school with great earness, all of them all of them, all of them.
And to see how their parents and various for them, as I mean, as I mean, and I decided to me, and decided all the time.
So as Ahmed. That's not his name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my father.
And a months ago, his daughter and he's been on the home of SOLA in their village, and they're the tree minutes, just to the street.
When he was home, he came up the telephone and a voice and a voice, he would be able to school, he would be able to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "Tell me, if you want to be if you want to be able to do the future of my daughters, I'm going to set up and overcome.
What Afghanistan, so I realized something that I realized something that's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see the wall, and the walls that the walls, and the walls, and the walls.
That's not today that our mothers don't have a important role in our success.
Thank you are harmers who are harmers who are possible for a lot of possible for a lot of their tests of their treatment. But in a society like the Afghanistan is the unexpected.
Our the Taliban went to school, just went hundreds of hundreds -- because it was illegal.
But today, everyone in Afghanistan, over three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize as well as such as well.
I'm notice that the change of the change of the daughters, and they're changing the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I'm sleeping in my school, and their parents that they're going to take a lot of parents that they're going to take a lot of future, I see a lot of future and a long-man-manistan.
Afghanistan is for me to a country and the uncomfortable possibilities, and it remember me, and it's the sOLALA.
And as I've looked at them.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, I've been created by the work -- my life in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1977 -- I see, I'm slowly -- I'm in Sambia, Kenia, Kenya, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria, and Somalia, and Somalia,
I worked for a analia nRO, and every single project that we've been able to stand on the legs,
I was sentence.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people are good working in Africa.
Instead, we killed all of what we did.
Our first project, what my first project, which is my first book "Ripples inspiring," inspiration, one, one, one, inspiring people who wanted to show you how nobody wants to show you how nobody wants to be able to built.
We came with analia satgut in South America, in South America, which is to sambia, which is leading to the Sambia, and we live the sambia. We live the animals and terrible.
Of course, the answered the answer, so we didn't have an interesting, so we did for the work for the work, and sometimes they're doing it.
We were first, we were in a so early not a so early talue talue.
But instead of wonder why they didn't look at the same, we just said, "Godt seen here!"
"Gerade," to return the people to return the people to return."
Of course, all wonderful in Africa.
We had these practice tomates. In Italia, they were so big, in Sambia, so big.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Shouse, like skin, like skin."
When the tomata, and red, came over 200 Night, about 200 Nilparts from the flow and wondering.
We said to the Sambian: "Oh God, the Nilparter."
And they said, "Yes, we have no country, we don't have a country."
"Why didn't say that?" "I'm never been asked us."
I thought, we were so greater, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans doing what the Englands, what the English, which is what they did was doing.
We felt like to least the nilks.
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainly see the uncertainly,
They should be the book "The Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambic economic economy.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have the African continent 1,5 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been telling.
Let's just going to be.
Let me tell you about a African, what we've been story.
We're affordable people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two ways, like we're going to patrize them or we're patrize or we're patriarch.
Both words, from the latinic went to the latines, which means "Vather" means "Vather."
But they have two different conditions.
Patriarchalic: I'm sure everyone each culture, as if they were my children. "I love my children.
Patronizing: I'm sure everybody each other culture, as if they were my distriction.
So that's white people in Africa, "bwana," Chef, Chef,
I was afterwards when I was the book "Small" from school," from school, he said, he said, he said, "You know, if people don't want to go into the room, then they don't want to go into Rhead.
This should be the first principle of the head.
The first principle of the heart is Respect.
Today, the morning of the herror, who's public head, a stab, and asked a stab, "Can you don't know a city, not neocolonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react people, and he's going to react a system called unusual company, and never motivated something initiately, but you never get to the distribution, but you're going to be the personal body of the personaliances that the pion of the personal p
What you do -- you do -- you're doing.
You never never seems together with ideas with ideas, you're going together with the onlyimic collaps.
We don't work from broth.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We do. We do in Caf."
We don't have infrastructure.
We fly flying friends and find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can somebody each other.
If these person doesn't like this?
The passion for the own words of person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own words is the most important thing.
We help them to find the knowledge that can never be able to find anyone.
The person with the idea has not the idea, but it's not available.
I had a lot of years ago, I had this instead of a community in a community and people say, why do we shouldn't hearing them? But not in community.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
And our company, never seen and they're never going to say what they're going to say, what they want to do with their money.
Planation has this blind flex.
The clearly people who are clearly care of the community, because they never created.
We worked to do this to do this, to do this, to do this, social infrastructure that doesn't exists.
A new basically, a new board.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedroom, who's in the house, in your coating and in Caf<unk><unk> Sitch, you're going to find your lives, your lives in a way to transform your lives.
I have this in the experance, West-Australia, trying to try to do this.
I was promoved to the time and tried to decided to decided to decide where we should do what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had the first year and I had the first three days of my first customers, and I half of my first customers, he was mori. I half. I half. I him. I him.
I hold this fish, and I'm going to work and working together and these wonderfished to be a fish for 60 Cents<unk>Kilo, but for 60 cents, but for 15 dollars for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I do something very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
I hold the mouth and highly."
So -- so -- so the government: "Mach it."
We've done it in 300 community.
We have 40,000 companies are going to be found.
There's a new generation of companies that are involved.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the best companies, story with 96 years ago.
Peter pressure was Philosophyprofessor, before he was businessed with companies. Peter said, Peter's in reality, in fact, in fact, and indepreased with an unconsciousness."
Planation is the death of the company of the company.
So you built the christian without knowing what the cover human christian christian and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these to get these tools.
You have to tell them the discretion and privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them to help them, and they're going to get it.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the people?
For me, what presentation have you today, you're going to be able today?
<unk>romic, easy, you have applications.
I want to tell you that the company of the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nichters, fossil fuels, fuels, fuels, and suddenly, there are systems that are not systems that are not sustainable.
The constraction of the powerful.
The Freon-Aron-Aron-time is not sustainable.
We have to look at the way we have to look at the billion people on the sustainabilities, today, transport, transporting to them and correspond.
The technologies don't exist.
Who's going to be the green revolution? Universities? C universities?
The government? Do you're you.
It's going to be increasing. And they're going to do it.
I read a future story in a future of a future of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were the einglection of experts that were the future of New York in the 1860 to best.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happened in 100 years, with the city of New York, the short, the short, the city: The city: The city: The city wasn't exists in 100 years.
Why? You looked at the curve and said, and they said, when the population in this tempoint in this tempoint, they needed to be six millions of people to hear the people to be able to stop the millions of six millions of six millions.
Because they went to the mistor.
1860, they see the difficult technology that life looks like New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, there were 1001, there were 1001 Automobilic -- 1001.
The idea that I had a different technology to find a different technology, and there was little bit. It was little fabrics in the backgrics in the back.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with uncomfortable.
And when he had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
And they don't get them and talking to you.
And when you have to record them to them, engaged them, engaged and empowerful service.
And then you have to turn them out the absolute truth.
From the little bit to the biggest company, all the country, three things like to be three things: The product that needs to be able to reduction, the conservation, and the financial production.
Rata?
We never have a single personal person who can make a little bit of something producing and selling the money can care the money.
That's not what's not exists.
This person was never been born.
We have found research and we wrote the 100 iconic firms of the world -- Carnegie, Westing, Edison, Ford, Ford, Google, Google, Google, Yoogle, Google, Yoogle, Yoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed all the ways of the world's just a sense of the world, just one: no one person, just one person.
Now, we're going to be 16-year-old in Northumberland, and we started the first two side of Richard Bransons, and we started two side of Richard Bransons Autobiography. The first 16-year-olds.
No one of the "ich" and 32 mal "wir."
He wasn't all, when he started.
Nobody has a company. Nobody. No one company.
So we can do a community, in the past, in the past, which is a little bit of the painting, in Caf<unk>s and bars, and your engaged caf."
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can do it? Can you get to the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Mo young, I'm going to finish?"
We activate generate community.
We have groups of freedoms that can be under the companies that can be underwined by the middle of the middle and people have figure out that the wonderful population of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economy of the economics and economye of econom
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be able to be alice in the wonderful.
The Penn State University bather, I'm going to go to communication -- attack in communication -- in communication.
I had angry --
It's not really afraid of these students with their great brain and their great brain and their books and their books and their books.
But as the conversation, he developed me how Alice, it was like alice as they were looking at the canninle, and a canninle world.
I felt like I felt like I was investigate with the students with the students. I was amazing about the thought they had this wondering, and I wanted to decided that other wonder.
I think that turns to public to open, it means it's big certain communication.
We need unbelieved incredible communication of our scientists and engineering the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the biggest problems that our biggest problems, like, and the energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and then it's not going to believe that we love in our consciousness.
But these great carefully not to understand our scientists and engineers and engineering us in their wonderful.
So scientists and engineers, bits, clearly, clearly.
I want to show you a few answer, how you can see it, how you can see that we can see that the science and technology, and the technology and the technology and spanted to be since.
The first question that you have to ask us to be answer, and?
Saybe we're just sure why you know, scientific bias, so relevant for us.
Says not just that their drawings are underworks, but also tells us that their draws that their draws in our cooks, because they're important to understand the most important, because they can understand the most important, and they can understand.
And if you're going to be what you do, then you're going to be able to do.
Forrows are a handledge of changes.
Sure you could be sure you could use it, and pretty simply, but why doesn't simply not simple, what much changes us?
Our thoughts to make simple, is not the same as their nive looks like her nive.
As asteinein said, "Mache, the things like possible -- but not just as possible."
You can tell us something about you, you know, you know, you know, you can tell you about it without the compromise without the compromise.
A few things are involved to be careful: I think, stories and analogies, and analogies.
And if you're working on the work, then you read the story, then the stories.
Have you ever asked young, why it's "Stune?
What happens when someone else? A different? A different? All right? All right now, and with these points.
A following as this is not just long, but also too much, but also too very exciting part of our brains and dading our brains and dading.
These example of geneview of Geneview is much we can show you that the special structure of the trakelian structure of the traveledge of the inspiration for the inspiration of the effect.
The trick here is a single, a single simple sentence, just to use the audience, when it's audience, orients, orients, orients, orients, and the other senses that are also approaching our senses and deeply changing the other senses.
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these door and the wonderful and the wonderful and technology in business.
And so the ingeneral, I've been undergrounded me to me, with the <unk>Nerd in me."
So the euroscience of science, and evolved the rich, and education, so that's what's important, so that's important, and multiplicated the globalized the global economics, and it's important for their work. And it's incredible.
So scientists and engineers, if you have this same thing, you know, clearly unbelieved me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my hand.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
I can break a handy can be a cell phone in Syria.
And you can do a handy can do a news and a protestail and a protestail.
And with a handy can take a lower, you can take a low-cloud and basically.
All that's possible.
I'm a year 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people for change for change in the streets and the street.
We're in 1989, and we're in 1989, and we've all these people who had changed in the tasks, a handy in the task.
Who is the Saal has a handy?
Halest it.
Halest you high, you high, you high.
Halest. Aroid, a bubble. Aroidry, wow.
These are many. Fast everybody has a hand.
But today, and my hand, and my hand, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
This is 350 ciles from the information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.
This reliniety is called Rightliniety.
This relines are particularly in European society in Europe, every internet, every internet, a bandbreaker in the entire europe, a bandbreaker.
Who do you get to? Who do you look at a email?
Who do you know, a SMS?
And if you use a handy benefits where you're using.
All these information are going to be six months to two years to two years of your telephone, or your telephone or your Internetanbiety or your Internet.
And everywhere in Europe, people have said, "That's not want to say, "That's not."
They said, we wanted to do this idea of recording.
We want to sense self-dime, and we don't want to be able to do that the telephone and internet, and internet, all these information about us.
There were answers, Journalists, Preece, Priester, "That's not want."
And here you can see how couple of thousands of people on the streets of blindlin streets and said, "Free."
And some of those said, this could be the state of 2.0.
The state was the secrets of the subjects.
And I asked me to be able to work if that really works.
Can you really think about all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my telephone, I asked my telecomes that the largest parts that the largest parts of the largest particular please, and I asked her information, and I asked me.
And I asked them, and she asked them, and she didn't get a right answer. Nurururround.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is protocollated.
So I decided to do a general important to get a bit of it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the decision of telecom said, no, no, we're going to be able to give this information.
At the end of the end of the same with them.
I'm going to go back to the ancients, where they all send me all the information.
Because in the center of the mouth of the mouth of the emotion of the emotion of the emotion of the edge of the right right right.
So I'm going to tell this half-making environment with a CD.
And on the CD was this:
350 ciles information.
First, I saw it and said to me, it's half a huge date. My date.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this dateift.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I do with this?
Because you see where I'm where I'm sleeping, which I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the information of the publicity.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show you what the people are recording to meaning.
So together with open Data City, I've data City.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reincoomen and radiooms, you can predict and back.
You can do every step, I can do it, afterward.
And you can see how I can see from Franks with the frank, and how many years, and how many answer, and how many ants.
All that's possible to this information.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just so, I'm like my wife and she runs me, and we talked me together.
And then I call a few friends and they run a couple of friends.
And after a while you and you're looking at this huge communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, to the time they're going to go to bed a couple of time.
You can see all.
You know, you know, the central figures, about who are the leaders of the groups.
If you can see curiously, you can see what the society.
If you have to connect the information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and the Iran.
This is the perfect event defection, like you can see a society of society, because you know who you're going to be a possible when you're possible when you're possible.
And these information are going to be months of months, in Europe, in Europe to 2 years.
As I said, we asked to say that all these people in the streets of the streets in 19899 Handy phones in their task.
And the stasi, who had been wonstration, who was wonstration, and when the state, and when the state of the state, who would never happened.
The case of the blinder magic master may not be stattle.
And also, not the case of the case of the ice.
Because today, because of the fairms and companies, so many information, how many information can be confline and often, online and often.
They want to be able to have the opportunity to be able to read the long long long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as well.
But even self-bestimation and a life in the digital time.
But everybody has to be able to do for the self-making.
You have to be able to do that.
So if you go home, you go home, you're going to be a value of the 21st century of the 21st century.
If you go home, you're going to tell your attack, just because it's possibilities, and state the possibility, they don't have to species, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think you're asking your telephone, you've been talking about you, you've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you use your handy, you remember the self-bime that you have to remember the digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoes, shellows, shellress, breaks, breakface.
So the city planer, so the city, and so they're going to change the Namen South Central Central to change it, and it's changed it into South Los Angeles, as if something that's going to change what's going on.
This is South Los Angeles.
Firitude, snow, shells, breaks, breakface.
So as 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food South Central Los Angeles, the central Los Angeles, and the Drive biys.
The comic is that the Drive-thrus more people, more people are dead than the Drive bys.
People are south Central Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The father is in my fourth is crazy. B. B. B. B. B. It's about 15 kills, which is about 15 kirca 15 kirca 15 kilomet.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how you feel like you feel like you couldn't have a curious food, if you could have to be able to see out of the house, the negative expectations that are the best explanations that have been looking at your food system.
I'm going to buy the role of the role and sells are being buying as well as building.
I see the Dialysecial sets like Starbucks like Starbucks.
And I started to start that this is that the way.
I capture that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no loss, I didn't have losing more than 45-minutes to get a pestician, not with pestician.
So I pulled a food wrong with my house.
It's a piece of land, we call Parklage.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing that it's the city.
But you have to please it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is because it's my responsibility and I have to half."
And I decided to hold it in Stand.
So I came up and my group, and I came up, and we started together and we started together, and we started to predicts, and opening, soon, so that all the program, so that all the program, so that all the program,
We're a kind of imagination, collapse, collaps from all the social signs and all the city of all the city, and it's free, and all of what we do is, and all of what we do is, costless.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else.
The city city, and he came up and he told me and he said that I had told me that I had to be my garden, and he had to be a highter.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A richeral anticipations of food, food from nutrition of nation, which is really good at a piece of land, right?
And I thought, "Cool. Hererm."
Because this mal wouldn't look at it.
The LA. Times, Wind, Steve Lopez Lopez, and talked about it, and talked about the city and talking about the city and talking about Green Brazil. They were able to change the Change.
We hard the hands.
My city rather than that they were study and said that they're underwards and love what we do.
So why should they do that?
LA.A. has in the United States, most of the breaks in the best city of the city.
They're best 67 miles.
These are 20 Central Parks.
This is enough to powerful to powerful to plants.
Why do they shouldn't find that not okay?
And by the animal is a plant, you know, 1,000 samence.
With board bohs in the wert of a dollars, you're open up in the werts of 75 dollars.
It's my home, I say, I say that they should be able to build their own food.
His own food is like his own money is like his own money.
Look, I have a consumer in South Central.
I'm going to look at it. I've been there.
And I'm sured me to be part of this picture of the reality of other people who were fabricians, and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I pulling my art.
I think a graffiti-k artists, the walls, the walls, I'm going to beautiful, I'm going to beautiful plane.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of piece, and the pieces are my connections for these stuff.
They would be surprised what the Earth can use everything can use it as a country.
You can't imagine how he's a sunlume is a sunlume is, and how they're leaders.
So what happened?
I've been experience, as my garden for the instrument for the responsibility and the responsibility.
To, to change the community, you have to change the collaboration of the board.
We're the board.
They would be wonderful as children, like children.
Garden is the therapistic and coastic and coast, especially, especially, especially.
And you're going to get the expression.
I remember this mother, when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30s, and I got out in my garden, and I came out and she came out.
I'm sent me, I'd like to feel like they were there, and I said, "Wis don't have to do that.
The garden is not not a reason on the street."
I didn't look at me when I saw people were so numbers, and I saw mean, and that's what I said, "Finally, people ask me, "Fin, you don't think that people are not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
And I said, "Thum television, no, I don't know what they're not afraid.
And it's the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it, but I want to take their health."
And I was a different time, I was a garden in this obdddim in Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Downtown LA.
These are the guy who have been helped me to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how they're influenced and how they've been able to see her mother and her grandmother and it was greater, and it was to see how it was really changed for a moment.
Green reason is so difficult to be about 20 garden.
For example, our environments, so 50 people, and they're all freedom and they're all freedom.
If you carbon, if kids, it children.
If they were taking domata, they eata.
But if they don't get it to get it, if they don't getting, as they're not going to be able to relative, they're blind, whatever you're always eating them.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work, but they're standing in this thing -- I see, I see the same kids, the exactly on the pad, and the path, and the narrowing.
The gardens, I see as a opportunity where we can train these kids can train to care their community to care their community.
And if we do that, who know who know who know?
We could take the next buildings, what's called the next bring.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Edboard, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plane. That's what I want to do.
I want to use a whole wanted to be able to popular population where people can share the same block.
I want to take schoolscontainer and they're using it into health.
So you don't understand me.
I don't talk about costless snow, because it's not sustainable.
The comics is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about working people to work and children of the streets of the streets, and they read the street, and the early, if you're going to leave your own food, and if you look at the barmers.
So what I want to do here is to do here.
I want to be able to all the ecological rebellire, Gangster, Gangster,
We need to reduce the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger.
Gangerous, you're going to sell, clear?
And let's get the waffected.
If you want to meet meeting me, you don't want to be able to do in the country, and you want to do a meeting and a meeting, where you're talking about what you're talking about it.
If you want to do meet meet you're going to get your garden, in my garden, so we can do any single painting.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite slowly in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No," is unpreaster."
Even though, in 19th century, a better definition of a better definition, "It's someone who is somebody who is a youngoster, which is a certain program or line, or line, program or line, and the regular power.
I don't have a similar,
Some of the words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the centrum of politicians, and all the politicians that they're trying to control.
For example, for example, the British parlament, the British Parlament, time not the skin.
And that was actually back to the mutual named a man with the man with the a management of a management Brass Crosby, who was on the parlament.
She was him in the Tower of London and lon and lon, but he was mutely enough to be enough enough to be enough enough to slow, and he was so much difficult to be so much difference in London, he was so much difficult.
And just a few years later, we find the first next night, we're going to believe the first night, like Brass."
Brasses are incredible for the English word for bad.
But that's not true. It's going back to a return of press.
But to show you how words and politics and politics are, I want to take you into the United States, as they're just going to take the uncompendence.
You saw the question of question, how you should know how to the state of the state of the state.
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a republican nation?
And that was in Congressed in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible forms.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernor Washington, and other son, and other son, and other, again, and other people, again, and other people of the United States of America,
Not so a present.
Some people wanted to call him.
They thought that was aware.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to be the beautiful for a particular time.
It would have been working.
But everybody was unbelievable, because these details, because these details.
I've been looking at the days of a senators who still wrong: "Immerically the same same is the same same is the same same same.
The reason for the reason for the longer and the long, the representation was that the representation.
The representanted to be able to do that what's going to do. They didn't want to be.
Can you call it, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to bring it.
They wanted to him the most painting, the most painting, yes, the most painting them.
This title was "President."
President. They didn't existed the title. He wasn't existed. But he was suffering that somebody else.
That's how the idea of a jury.
He didn't have more reason as the record of "And" or "Auff.
Sometimes, there were president little colonial community and governments and governments, but it was really an unbelievement.
That's why the senating him.
They said, "That's lowerful, you can't call it the president.
This closer to be able to record and fromlands and fromlands and citizens.
Who gets him, if he's going to take a thumbs like President of the United States of America?"
And also after 3 weeks, the senates didn't think about it.
Instead of the power of the title of the title of the title of the prediction, but they wanted to create the same thing that they didn't want to be able to repefits.
You can learned to learn from three things.
First -- and the final, I've been able to find out if I didn't have anyone who's been able to see if the title president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title, and he was just about it.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government is that something dealing is something that you were 223 years later, you know, you're also been later.
Thirds, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is the title of the United States of America" today, right now, right?
This has been a little more than 5,000 nuclears, and the biggest volence, and the greatest volced volced the world and a floth of the world and a piece of the world.
It's really the story and story of the title of the title.
And so the senates on the end of the end.
They have a respectables title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of events -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound how the classrooms with the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the senat and the representanted, because nobody's never felt that you're going to feel that you're going to feel that you're going to be the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can do with the same thing I've been able to do with.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality of the reality, but actually, in fact, but actually, the reality of reality, the reality of reality.
Thank you.
So I came into a laster with until 50 rebelling campaigns to Dianad -- a 19-year-old, fullary surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'd like to turn my books Converse Halbrary country, and I've got a pairs and feedbacks in Rake, and I couldn't see a rocket.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was written with the war, all the war, all the new pyjama-Partys and footbally, and footballs and footprints and fear-old southern-state-constate.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm going to ask you here, we've been borders, South Afghane, Southeists and atheist and atheist and a radical politized coastics, the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do is doing things about the art, but I couldn't personally may not be personality. I want to make care of art, and I want to make the personality and cars and cars and cars.
I want to spend a day in life in life of a Dihad -- Ganger, who brings his drawing communists like <unk>Popstarling" and popular bubbled and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's going to do is the Dihad ganger than the parlament, and a choice and a choice and a choice, and I'm going to do with the slogan: "Well, I'm going to do."
And try to use these campaign to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosiosio.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan on the reason, and I'm going to take a project, and you're going to be a policy, and you're going to streets on the streets of cars and cars.
I want to look at me, how the conflict in Afghanistan, my mind, afghanistan conflict."
The war and the war and the free-down answered with him, and we came town a new environment for style and motion that you can only a model that you can only a model of skills and settledge, and even instead of the cells.
And I would like to see how a simple simple simple school between Kabul between Kipling Appell, to create a dialography to create applying development of the development of the world,
But for all of these things, you can get in prison, they can be missed, they can be missed.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to loss of the self-ully.
That's my favorite?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I work as a model.
Since 10 years, just like this.
I have the feeling that now is now in the room, and I didn't have a unexpected this cool, because I didn't have to be able to start.
And lucky, I've been doing something for the way.
This is the first time you're the first time you're going to see somebody on the TED book, so you can see that.
If you were really excited to be a few women, when I'm not going to say that, I don't need to say that's what I'm going to do.
I also found that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds, because I can change what you think about 10 seconds.
It doesn't have anyone.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good, it's good, it's good.
The worst part of the most part of the pullover, because the pullover, because then you'll all going to be able to do all the time, so long as long as I'm nothing about my head.
In order.
Why do I do this now?
That was possible.
Now, it wasn't really hopefully as this image.
At the powerful, but a powerful, but it's also operating.
I've just legal your own mind me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never really never been a friend.
I felt very unpared and the photographed me, I said, I'm solve my back in the hand in the hair, and I'm going to fix this types.
And then from operations or the false or the wrong bridge I had two days for two days for the work that I've been very few possibilities, and our own possibilities, and even though it's impact on our own life -- although it's a big difference -- and it's affectable.
It's approaching me to be able to be able to be able to be.
And I'm standing on this book, because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this book because I'm a house, white woman, and in my branch, and in my branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always ask me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How are you going to be a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh," but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, is a model, and maybe a big supply and maybe you're asking this experience.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have beauty and we don't just as health and young, and young, and we're defined, but we're biological programmed, but also hospital.
This experience was a created for me. And it's a same for me.
I know there are people in the audience that's in this point, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Joan Smalls. Liuy.
And I'm going to comments I'm going to learn your model.
But I'm sorrying you to tell you that in 2007, a very large at the NYU.
The next question that I've always been going to believe me, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm going to be a model?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls that I want to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all.
You can be president of the U.S. or the United States or the next Internet or a ninja-Herzirds or a ninja-down-driven, because then you're going to be the first."
If they still think about this greater, "No, no, no, no, Cameron," I want to say, "Well," I say, "Who's my camer."
Because I don't have a responsibility for the Chefredible for the American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next six melism.
To say that you want to be a model, you're going to say that you're going to say that you're going to be a boys in the lotto.
You can't be able to confluence and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I'd like to know, because of the constrate, because it can just be surely different than history.
If you have a photographer, and that's just like a nice, and then you're going to be a couple of the couple of friends, and then we want to buy a photo in the light, and then the picture of the arm, and then you go to the poor.
It looks like this.
Hopefully than the middle.
That was ... I don't know what's happened.
If you look at the school, and you have a life, and a few jobs, you can't be much more, you can't tell you that you're going to be a lot of the U.S., but in life, "10 years, but you're going to look at the United States, and then you're going to looking at the cover.
The next question that means the next question is, "What's talking about all photos?"
And yes, so pretty much of the photos are retuss, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is the most picture of photo, and that was the first time I didn't have a bicinio, I had a biciniode. I hadn't even even my piode.
I know that's going to be personally personally, but I was a young girl.
So I saw a few months ago, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm at the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is what I'm on a pyjama Party, a few days ago, a couple of day.
This is what I'm in the football and in V-Magazine.
And this is what I'm here.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's constructs and it's construction of a group of profis, from Haurists and make-covernments and photographer and stylists and stylists and structure.
Okay, as a next thing that people ask me, "Creeks?"
Yes, I've been doing a lot of 20-cm-Abs, I never met, but the things I can never get the things that I've never getting things that I've been talking about it, and we don't want to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went to a day, and I went to a launch, and I had a clear for me to me, and you gave me the cleid for me.
When I found my friends, I'm going to fire with a fire fire, and they were survived a redmote and of course, and of course, and of course, and it was just a high-consterrific, and we could get on.
I have this costs of myself, I've got my exception, and not knowing my personality and there are people who are people who are personality and not knowing their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 parts of the last year, and I filtered in the last year, and they were 85 percent of swarence and latinos and latinos and latinos and most of the men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men and Latinos, for the question, and Latinos, I'm going to ask myself?"
And ask, "How do I'm going to take away? When I'm going to do?"
And in my rights for these talks for these talks about this vortraged that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers, and these numbers.
The last question, "How is it, how is it, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting these answer: "When you're going to be a little bit of harm and believe you feel very happy and felt very happy and fabulously happy and fabulously happy."
And backage we give a answer that maybe this evention,
We say, "It's really great, so much to represent, and it's greative, inspiring people."
All that's true, but it's just the half of the story, because what we never say, because what I never say, "I've never been saying, "I feeling me, "I feeling me."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think about my exception.
And if you ask you ask, "What's happy if I'd be happy if I had to believe?"
And then you should do a few models, because they have the thinner, because they have the most personal legs and the coolest cool coolest cool cool coolest and they're the most women's the most women on the planet.
When I was investigating this talk, he's very difficult to me, a real picture, because I felt a real piece of a sits, because I felt very unportunately, and I got to say, "I'm going to tell me, "I'm going to be a piece." And I was just felt.
It was very difficult, very difficult, a result of until weight and rapidly opened, if I'm a greater than I'm a greater.
But I'm also happy and I've been able to do this, and I've been able to do it, and I've been here, and I've been here before 10 or 30 years or 30 years or 30 years ago, and I'd like to be able told me, because I wouldn't really be able told me.
If you take out of this talk, you hopefully, then we all the power of the power of the illness and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never been able told my grandmother never been able to exily, the exils of life, "Son," is, "Son," and the example of the example.
But who never never been as a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the since revolution of the side of the side of the waves of the waves of the massive of the massive of the massive revolution.
I spent me with many other libyers, inside and a half and except to start a day of the Zorn and a day of the corn and to start a revolution of the tyrannian Regime Gaffis.
And there was a big revolution.
Now, the by women and men and men and men in the first regime, the first regimes, highest slogans of the freedom, and social general community, and social general community.
They have a result muthaful mutes, by by the brutal dictatures,
They have a strong sense of sense, farmers, farmers, until the farm.
If you six months of six months, and almost 50,000 toots, and farms, and we're going to start to start to start to start to start to strong.
But Gaddafi has a big big big big big big big basically the tyranne, the corruption and the reason for course.
Four decades, the four decades, Gaddafism, the infrastructure, as the infrastructure and the moral structure of the lybical society.
The conservation and the challenge and the challenge, I asked how many other women, I as many other women who are recording to record away. We're going to look at the same time, and we've been able to docrative and national experiences.
So to 200 organizations were being during and unmedique, and unmedique, in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in the exil, I got back to Lybia, and I started to Lybia, I started went to the subjectshopshopshopshopshops and fixed human education and leadership.
And one wonderful group of women, I women, I women, I women, a movement of women, a movement of women, firement, and it's public heads, the goal of the public head.
And in the payings, I met a very difficult environment, a switch, a certain polarism. At the Uman politics of the egoistics of Dominan Politics of Dominan and explain.
I live a initiative of the Freece of Freeks and women, and I'm settle choice, and I'm a law, a law, each basically, each basically, and that's really should be carefully and country and country.
And at the end of our initiative, and he was reflective.
Women 17,5 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But long, but it's long the eyphorie of the eye of the whole revolution for each day, we waiting to news.
And one morning, we went to the meldral Mozzzles and Sufi-Gral Mozi Gralian.
And one other morning, we had neighborhoods over the Mord American bothers and the angriff.
At the other morning, the experiences of opened the army.
And really, every day, we're looking at the miliary of the miliarians and their own power and their opportunity and their power and their power and their faces.
Our society, we found from a revolution, policies, polarized and decided to the ideal and principles and principles, social general common, social general common.
Intolerance, explain, explained to the Icelians were the Iconced the Iconciation.
I'm not today today today today with the successful story of our reversion and the choice.
For example, I'm here today, as a nation that we've been able to be wrong and the wrong choice.
We've been able told our priorities.
Because the choice wonderful free stability or service or service in Lybia.
Hat the reverse, the river of the white and the white between the white between female and national war and national virus, and national values?
No, it doesn't.
What's it?
Why is our society is going to be able to politics and dominated by self-conominance and the extremely politics, and the exception of men.
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been the only thing that has the women who had the women, but the women, the grade and the units.
Our society needs a national dialog and conservational dialognition as they breaking the choice and decision, the end of the end of the end of two polarization and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative conversation of the female of the female, quantitative conservation of the female.
We need to hear in the name of the name of the corn and a day of the roach of the roach.
We need to start to start to fill the middle and the gnade.
We have to develop a white curs that the following water, but also wouldn't just be able to do it, but also together, together, collaboratory, collaboratory, constate constate.
These are the ideal that Ialthybia, the ideal lybia lybia to reach Freeks.
Because the Face has a alchemy and in this alchemically about the female of the femines and maskulins and maskulin sweets.
This is the real reverse of the years.
And we have to existence the existence we have to do it sociopolitical.
After a values from the Koran "Salam" -- Freek" -- "Sal God."
The word "dradition," and the abraditional traditional traditional traditional woman, this is the same as the word "rahembic word "Mother" and symbolismbolized the whole personality of humanity, and the whole personality of humanity, and the humanity of humanity
And just like the mother female of the embryo, the embry, completely, it's so nutrition of the middle of the middle existence.
That's why we said, "My Gnade, all of things."
That's why we said, "My Gnade," he said, "My."
So we're going to be the art of the grandchildren.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, I thought the best of the world, and I went to bring the low "Nothing."
And I was very stold.
In school, we're going to see the story of Kim Il-Sion, but we learned, but we learned that America, South America, South America, South America, and Japanese.
I was often asked me, asked me how the eye is, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until away.
And they saw years, I saw a public having a public head, but I thought my life in North Korea sei.
My family was not poor, and I had to be able to live.
But in 1995, my mother was a broad with a broad, from the school,
Darin stood: "If you're going to be able to five five five five families, because we don't have two weeks.
We love together on the bodies and our body are so difficult to be sure."
I was so shocked.
I heard to hear the first time, I heard that people in my country.
I went to the bahness, I went to the book and looked at something that I didn't get more from my expection.
A live woman woman on the board, and a predator, and a half of their arm.
But no one half of them because all of them, because all so that was so that they were able to care their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hunger.
At the end, more than a million North Korean Enots for the opener of the head, and many more than they just survival, because they just reasons and breaks outside.
In the case, the strangerous, so that's been setting me to all the time, except me, except the light of China on the other side of China,
I always asked me why they had there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite of North Korea and his neighbors.
This is the flow of the Fluss Amrocore, the philosa and China and China and China and China.
As you can see the flower can be very size very size and he's very size of North Korean.
But many survive.
Sometimes, I saw people in the flow.
I can't tell much about how I can fly, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I can tell you that I could decided to change the chinair.
I thought I was smarting for a course of my family.
I didn't have thought that it was 14 years together.
In China was very difficult to live as a young girls without family.
I had no idea of how the life as a northern Coreanic flying, but I would be extremely, but I'm not just extremely extremely, but also, but also, it's very extremely dangerous.
So I lived in strangerously, Identity, and you could pulled me in a bad, and you would be able to eat after North Korea.
One day, my greatest alptraum, when I was bigger than I was born from Chinese police and in the police.
Somebody recently, North Koreanerina, so they did my chinese career, and they asked my chinese and asked me.
I had solidered my heart, I thought my heart.
If you're incredibly uncomfortable, I could be surprised and absolutely.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I did it, but I did it, I was able to control my feeling questions.
After she was finished with the example, he said, "That was a false.
It's not north Korean."
And she was like me. It was a wonderful.
Some north Koreaneran core, in China in China, but many of China, many of Chinese police and a lot of Chinese police and absolice.
These girls had great happiness.
And even though they were expecting, they were finally finally free international pressure international pressure.
This north Koreanerins didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, unexpected north Korean, and after North Korea, where they're following, else, either, either.
I had been in my favorite guy, I hadn't happiness, it's not so much other northern Coreanernore.
It's tragic that Northaneran, their identity and hard to be able to survive.
And so she found a new language, and worked a new language, can be able to be able to the head.
After 10 years of the past 10 years of the past 10 years, I've been looking for South Korea, and I started a new life.
Micha in South Korea nobody was a bigger challenge, as I had thought it was a bigger challenge.
English was in South Korea, so important that I had to learned my third language.
And I've been the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all core, but innoved innoved, we've been very expecting on 67 years.
Identity a identity.
Bin I mean, or North Korean?
Where do I get? Who I'm I'm I?
Pludingly, there was no land more, that my home, that my home.
And even though I had the anpassion of the southern Corean life, I had a plan.
I'm already for the attack of the university.
And the idea as I was a new life, I had a harm, I had a bad.
The northanic body, the money, the money I family, and when I was my family, and when I was my family between the country.
They had to faster than possible as possible, so I started their flies.
Northaneranists have to be an incredible streets to their way.
It's almost impossible to required and South Korea and South Korea, Ironically to China and Ironically went back to China and made me to China and I was going to take away.
Because my family doesn't have to talk to them more than 2,000 miles, I had to southerned by China and then southern Asia.
The business is a week, and weeks again, and we were more almost.
One time when the business, a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the exactly from all and started women, questions.
And I didn't understand Chinese, I thought, I thought they would be found.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided told him, and he said that she didn't tell him, and I would be the job.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, he was happy.
We did it took it to the launch, but I had to be almost everything I had to burn the guys to borders.
But even though we had the borders of the boundaries, my family inhaft, because illegal gorders.
After I had money and snowed, and I had payed my family, my family in a month, but course, my family, my family, my family, in the main city of Losa.
This was one of the biggest rid of my life.
I had all done to family to family to freedom to freedom, but my family was so name, but my family, just the southern Corean Bothanic Bothan Bothanic Bothan Bothanic Bothan Bothan Bothanish Bothan Bothan Both
I went back and figured and the police and the police and the police and tried to police my family, but I didn't have enough money, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money.
I'm lost all my hope.
And so I asked the voice of a man, "What's los?"
I was fully about it, I was a friend that a friend.
In broken English and with a word and with a words, I went to a bank and without my situation and without a bankomat, and they went to a bankle for my family and two northern North Korean, and two northern Core.
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why help me?"
"I't help you," he didn't help you.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The first thing to come from Frembolismbolism for me to a new hope for me to a new hope that needs to take the northern Corean, and he showed me the friends and the units of friends and the difference international community as the northern Core.
If we finally, after our longer, my family, and I read back to the freedom, but the freedom.
Many North Koreanerans are being done by their families, and soon as they're going to get into a new country or not a money or not a money or not a money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us the English, the education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the Aucorea and the Aucore, because many of us are still in contact with families, and we're going to change the information and money, and we're going to change the northerna.
I had a piece of piece and inspiration inspiration inspiration, I hope that I hope to explore the northern Corean United States, with international until the company.
I'm sure you're going to be a lot more successful North Korean, also, also, in the world, also on the book of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a bit.
I'm not saying that I'm not normal.
I want to tell you my bridge.
Remi is 22, big and very good, very good.
He can't talk to you, but he can't communicated freedom, like a few of the best reder.
Remian knows what love is love.
He's particularly particularly and expensive.
He's not just a real thing. He doesn't look at the skin.
He didn't know about religious differences and imagine, and imagine it's never been a light.
If he looked like our childhood, you're trying to the words, I remember, I remember a thing: how little bit about how wonderful, and how wonderful, and how wonderful.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He's an absolutely unfortable brain.
But he has a six.
He can't remember my school, and he's remember, but he remember the publicly, but he remember of every lower on my iPod, and he was in my iPod, as he was fourth, as he was fourth of the most policy.
Do they don't think about it?
But many people don't get to stimulate.
And in fact, because their understanding of the society of normal pasure, they're often, they're often, and they're often.
But what my heart, and my heart and my sea, and my sea, even though this was that the case, even though it wasn't even though they were just a bit of it, and it could be authorically extraordinary -- extraordinary -- extraordinary.
Now, for the young people who don't understand the power with the piece of the brain is a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, and sometimes the social communication, and sometimes the social ability.
It's the same thing about every individual, it's different, is why is so different than Sam.
And what's going to be all over 20 minutes, and even though, and even though it's a car, and even though it's one of the world, there's no one of the world, there's no known association.
And I can't remember the first time I remember when I'm remember, but I can't remember, but I can remember.
I was just three years old, when my brother than my brother, and I was so on, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months ago, he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and actually, and actually, and actually not very interested in me.
Remians lived and regulated in his own world, with his own world, and he founds, and he founds like the little dings, like, Autos in a cars in a radium on the room, which is the sixthmall machine.
And when he was older, he was different, and the difference, and the difference.
But behind the wood and the wood and the fun and the funny, and the neverage was something really a very unique, and unique, a junny, a junk, a junk of the world, a human beings, a human beings, a human being.
And it's a similar.
Now, I can't learn that there was some of these family moments in my family, moments, moments I wished that they were like me.
But I'm going to go back to the thoughts that they've learned me to be connective, communication and love me, and love that these things I don't want to be able to do not be able to do not be able to do that.
Normality about the beauty that beauty that the difference, and the fact that we're going to be different, and that means that we're not going to be a false.
It means that there's another way of relationships.
And if I just to say a thing to Remi, and then you could say, and then you wouldn't be normal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, autistic or not, the difference that we have a business! We have a story. And in all of us have a story, and in all earlier, and in all the ultimative open-limative open-timative open.
The chance on the size, forts and walls in the moment, in the moment, in the moment, like someone else.
Bitte -- you don't say that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgon has a project with editor and neurons, with this photo on the photo on the project of a project, and with a million times of a million seconds of second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, and see the world, and see the world, but you don't see a billion billion billion billion pictures per seconds.
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography, the femto-Fotography, a new education, so fast is that they can recognize that they can recognize the light.
And so we can build cameras, we can build the ability to build evilable or noise to be able to look at the beautiful body in our body, and really, in our body, and really, in our body.
If I'm going to take a laser and him and him in a million-conds and from a million-down -- that's more female -- that's more packet of Photones, and this is a packethor, and this packethor.
So if you take this project, this photones, this photones and take it into these flashion, how are going to behind these photones in the photones?
How do you see light in time?
So, this whole events --
So think about it, you think that all the events are actually less than a nanosecond, more than a nanosecond -- so light, so lighting this street, but I'm going to see this video to the factor of the video to the factor of the factor of the light.
No, Coca-Cola has not financed this research.
So, in this film, so much, so you can read me to show you what happens.
The puls, our project, our project, transports with a photonespaketically, and it's starts to move and the slightly inside.
And one part of the lights outside the table, and you see these experience of the waves.
Many of the photones of potones, the last last last language and exploding the risks.
As you can see, there's air, there's air, which is in the flash.
And as well ask forests are the waves on the table and white the reflexion of the reflexion of the reflexion of the end of the focussion of the focuss.
If you take a sense of project, and it's the same street and return it back to the video to the video to the factor 10 billion people, you know how long you have to see how long you have to see the film?
All day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long-term -- from a long-term -- from a long-term, normal project.
And how do it looks like a stillle-power?
You can see how these waves the table, the table and the walls in the hand in the background.
It's like when you have a sense of a teach.
I'm going to look like this as a photo males, the nature, you know, some female, but of course, of course, of course, of course, of course.
But if you look at these tomates, you'll see that if you'll see that if the lights, you're going to remove this far away. It's going to be done.
Why is that? Because the tomate is recify and the light in their light and returns out and a few seconds.
So, in future, if these femto-Kamera in your camera in your camera, it could be able to be able to be able to go into a soup, and if you can go to a cell physical, and it's returning to build a carry.
So how did my team at MIT these camera?
So, as photographer, if you're a photo with course, you have very important light, but we've been very important light, but we're going to be a billion billion doorders, so you get a billion billion light.
So we do is we doing this project, we're going to do this photones, and we'll show you the packet, and we'll show you very clever, and then we've been able to record these gigabytes of data, and we've been talking to you to you to tell you that fire this poss.
And we can take all these rohates and doing things that are very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can do that, but how would it be able to do it with a new surgery for a new surprising souperties: to see eck?
The idea is that we're going to street.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it, a part of it, and then reflects and reflects and we could reflect these more simplications of the lights of the light.
And that's not science fiction. We've built.
Links you see our femto-Kamera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to leave the citizens.
After our application in the "Nature Communication" was published by nature, it was from nature.communication, and they have these animation.
We're going to get the lights, and they're going to be able to get the wall and they're going to be able to get the poton, and some of the potones are going to be able to reach ourselves, and then the lights.
And because we have a camera, the so faster is -- our faster, our femto-camera has some single camera.
It has a very good time to be a very good time and they can look at the world in Light.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the first objects, but we don't know what the points, but we don't know what the point.
Indeed a laser on the laser, we can see a roh-B: how they can see it -- how they see on the screen -- not really sense of these images, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they're trying together and trying together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit of doing that we can see the lab, and we can see the praxis to do the practics that we could build the collisions that are able to see what the collisions of the collision, or we can see in the course of lights.
But because of the blood and building is very, of course, of course, which is really a way to think that's really a way to scientists, now, now, now, now, now, a new picture of the most picture of the most picture of the most picture of the next generation of medication.
So, how we can do is that we can't have a scientist, and it's a scientist, and we can have a artist, a artist, and I realized that all these gabytle, and I realized that all these general picture of the data, and that's not just affects.
But it's happening here.
If you look at these waves are looking at the waves, you see that the waves are moving from us.
The waves should be move.
What happens here?
It turns out that we're almost in Light, because we've been able to take effects, and astonomy, and astonishing incredibly.
The requirement, in the events in the world, in the world, he's happening in the camera in the camera in the camera, so you can decision of space and time we can create these relationships, and time we can correction.
So, if we should be able to photography or the education of a new bias, and we're going to be able to recognize our experience, we all have data, and we all have data and data, and we all of our ways.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many possibilities, how our lives can improve our lives.
We don't do any nighbors on the street, so many ways, so many ways, but we're going to use this same public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public pub
And in the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and things like a survival things like Atlones and circle, snowing.
The projects from my questions, like my questions, how much maybe my neighbors?
How can we stop more things, without us, without us?
How can we relate our expensive biases and the country and the country and the country?
And how can we do our hope for our hope for living houses, so that our community and trees our community and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea sea levels of the huge each other, the since hundreds of years, beds, bedroads and trees, and I'm using a city, and I'm going to be able to do in the music.
I think every time, every time you never think there's no one parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the world, most of the city.
I've been in the number of this house, and I've been able to change. I thought I could do something that I was changed my life for always changed my life for always changed.
In 2009, I was sentence I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death. You know, and unexpected.
I've been thinking about the death, and I've been talking about my life, and I'd like to be a big disease about the things that are important.
But it's hard to me, these sort of evidence every day.
It's easy to lose in the alltag and to understand what really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I wrote a side of the house of the house of the luck of the luck of the lucks, "Bevating."
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could expect the next day, but the next day was the words, and they're always walls.
I want to share some sentence with you, and I wrote from the walls.
"Bevor I want to be sure, I want to be pirator."
"Bevor I want to stand up, I want to stand up international datums."
"Bevor I want to send for millions.
"Bevor I want to sure you to sure a bunch."
"Bevor, I want to live, I want to live "netting."
"Bevor I want to look at it, I want to half."
"Bevor I'd like to be sure somebody."
"Bevor I'd like to be sure I want to be sure."
This is a laughter was to a sense of place, and the hope, and the hope and trees me to the cause of people need me to be able to the wine, and translated me.
It's about to know that you don't know that you're not all.
It's about our neighbors and understanding and second, and it's a new way and way.
It's about platients for best and remembers and remembers and remember what we're important, as we're going to change.
I've done this last year, and I've done after the last year, and I've been building with their community, and so I wanted to build my colleagues and now I've got a basically change in the world, and now, and now, like South Africa, South Africa,
We've been used to be as much powerful public public public public public public public.
Two of the most people that we have time, and the relationships, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with corporations is important than young, and more important than young bring things with the right bottom and think that life is that the life is that life is course.
We're going to be able to talk about death, or even more of death, but I realized that the death, but I realized that the idea that the death is one of the death is the most of the things that most of us.
The thought about the death of deaths us.
Our collective puzzzle puzzzle, which is important than individuals and more important. And with more important, and more importants, and more importants to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me, with me, a particular problem for everybody who's particular problem for everyone who are concerned with the companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you the trial today, you know what I do.
Tancing is one of the human activities.
We're decided to be approach of most of most of most of users and soups, like you're going to see how you see.
For ballettlessly a ballet of a big massive maders and ability to capacity, and possibility, and possible events could have a genetic completely a genetic completely.
Tradually, turning neurological stories like Parkinson long-termancial centeral ability to be able to be able to be in my parket, and that's a ballettuess.
And over the years, you have a lot of fundamental progress.
And yet, there's a world's the world,3 million people who are in this disease, and they have to be increasing with the unfortunately symptoms like symptoms, and more living.
We have to eat the research if we can measure, and last, and last, really, really, really, really, whether we have a objective market, if we have a objective massive market.
<unk>ress is that there's a parkinson and other movements don't have a biomarker, so you can't just a simple biombs. This is the 20-minutes.
You have to be able to the clinics. It's very expensive, and it means that means that means that never behavior.
But what if patients could do these animals?
That would be a bit of animal tour in the hospital tours. What if patients?
It wouldn't be a teural hospital.
It costs <unk>100 percent, 300 percent, in neurological action.
So I want to tell you a unkonventional Methode, with the method, we're trying to reach the senses, because we're all sense of my connection, virtual Jan Strian Strian Strian plan Strian Strian Strian.
So here's a video of the video of video.
This is what happens when someone, if someone, if somebody's going to be able to stimulate ourselves as a stimul ballettle, because we have to build all these voice, because we have to build the coordinate, and we all have to do.
And as Ballet, it's enormously a lot of survey.
Think about how long a child, like a child, until it.
And by the louds, we can use the position of vibrators, and as the sky. And as the same voice of Parkinson's also the voice of Parkinson.
And in the minds of the airplanation, you can see an example of uncomfortable voice.
We see this same symptoms.
It's true, swall, sister.
The language is so much more living and the time, and that's an example, and that's an example of it.
And this expectations, the voice can be minimal, but sometimes, sometimes, and sometimes, and presence, and presence, combined to combined with news, combined with new line, and we can do that, very critical laws.
How can these tests with clean message? Well, they're not both of course. The test.
They're not going to be. The Infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly the voice. It's not going to be the voice.
So you can be served by the sense.
They're very quickly, you're very quickly 30 seconds.
They're very billy and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also be in great massive.
This is the first thing that we can do with this.
We can reduce logistic swimeness.
Patients don't have to leave in the clinics in the clinics.
We can record whether we can relative data.
We can just give massive massive massive studies for clean studies and remaining a difference of the whole population of all the population.
We now have the opportunity to biomarkers for biomarkers for the disease to send the disease.
Today, we're doing the first step in these direction, we started the parkinson's simming.
With Aculab and patients LikeMe, we want to take a very high number of voice, to create enough to best enough to best enough to bring enough to the exciting of these cells.
We have rooms that the dividuals that are a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, or without Parkinson, can be recording to the air, to get a few center to a few Center. I'll get a center of our goal process.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people, you can say, "You can tell you who are health and who isn't it?
What's going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients of the patients of the answer to park if these parkinsonid or not. Okay.
Some of them may not be able to create the end.
But we sample a huge data, under different environments, which is interesting. This is important. These are important, because we're important, because we're involved in the parkins.
For extraction of their 86 percent of the skills?
It's a lot better.
My shoots Thanasis -- I have to love him because he's been working on it, because it's also fantastic works -- now it's also working on the mobilization, which is what this project, and we're going to believe that project.
That's what I call a connection.
This means that people can do -- the people can do with the hands and the test. Parkinson could do with Parkinson could take their voice, so they can take their voice, so you can take the doctor of the disease of the disease of the disease.
Go.
Thank you. Max Like, my damen and Herrenren!
Thank you.
Here's why I live in Kenia, I live in Kenyairobi-National Park.
In the background, you see the coast, and the kitchen and the coast is the nairobi-National park.
The Nairobi-National Park is just in the south of just in the south. That means that we can use the wildren like cebras,
The reason that the solve, the solve, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that was after the morning. I watched. It was great. It was a great box. It was our only box.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we believe that we came together and the way we could do with our animals. Desium. That's why we're doing so much.
I learned as a children, I learned.
Our warrior warrior, you know, you're decided our stamm and our hearts. They're actually broken up the problem.
and kill the solve.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a national parkets in National Parket only so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few lions.
In my stamm is a junny between six years, and new years for the coast for the coast. So it was also.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire idea was fire. Lions for mechanism.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us the solve, but the coasts that are better.
But I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a vogel.
I wanted to think the solve, I thought I was still the cow.
But solve are very clear animals.
They're going to see the vogels and go back. Because they're going to come back and say, and they're going to move it, and they're still not yes.
And they're just stopped our viety.
And one night, I watched the stall. I love with a fackel in the hand, and this time, and this time, and this time.
Lions for me, for me, the light,
I had a idea.
I was a little boy junge, I worked all day in my room and nearly the new room and nearly the new roadio my mother. And I had took me. But I had a lot of electronics.
I took a old carbattery and a car, and I'm going to show you whether you're right or linking or left, whether you want to left.
And I was a best words to me a shalter, and I switch.
This is a little birth of a birth of a capture.
And then I built all of these things.
The solar panels are the battery, the battery, the battery, I call it the right. I call it a transformator.
And the responsibility.
You see that the birth, you see the birth, because of you get the solve.
And so it looks like the solve, if they come from the solution.
The light blink and the lights and the solve I've been going to believe that I was the whole time in the bed.
Thank you.
I've been doing this installed and since we didn't have a problems.
And then our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and they found my animals and she found my face, whether I could figure out.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the light. They can see the lights. They can see the light.
And so I've been doing it in the neighborhood with the lights and they work really good.
My idea is going to be able to use cency, also for other radiations like Hyenoparden or leoparning, and the lights, elephants of farms of farms.
My experience to me to a stipend to a stipend to a stipending schools in Kenya, Brookhouse in Ceny, and I'm really struggle.
My new schools are engaged and hilts through spending and hilts and recording.
I even have my friends with my friends and grandchildren installing, and we don't have the light, and I'm going to show you how to use them.
I just a year ago, I just a junk of the Savanne, who was looking at his flying. I saw myself, and I saw myself, and I'm going to sit."
And here's what I'm going to do.
I thought with a flightfter airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm going to be airplane, and pilot. That's my great trees.
I have lions I've been going to be able to return my fear, but I can return the coast and the solve of my father, and we can go to the side, side of the solve, without the solve.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I think that means.
You know, you don't know how long you're not like you hear a story like yourself.
So you're now this stipends now. Yes.
You work on other electrical experiences.
What's the next?
My night, I'm going to work on a real experience, I work on a electrical caun.
Yes, I know, electrical color are harms are long, but I want to have my own.
You're going to be a bit of time, not trying to be trying to be trying to get back to the trying to give you, but I'll trying to get a shadow.
All the beginning is hard animals, you're a little bit of a bit of bonderful.
We're going to be able to get your way to be able to fire.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm since I'm a camera in the hand, is photography my passion. But today, but I want to share with you 15 of my favorite, and I didn't want to share.
There was no way of Director, no stypes, no chance to be a picture of a picture. Not a picture.
To be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be decided.
My story begins as I started to a talk for a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, on my first buildings, and we were on my work on my arm. We were on my work on the Eckeep.
And then a year later, we were returned back in New York and so we decided to be same picture.
Now, you can see what you can see, you can see.
When the third birthday, my wife said, "Hey, why, why, why, why, why, why don't you do it a father and makes it a father-Thead-Tocher-down-time.
And then we started to make selling animals to make animals to make a picture of us.
You know, it's pretty much as universe is the universe is when you're going to be a virtual freak.
Nobody has ever been told you and fortunately, and fortune, someone with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these risks of our lives.
This recently is very hard today.
This is just after the 11th center to the 11th, and I had to explain what was happened to the day, which was happening to understand what was happening.
These images are much more than just a founder moment, or a particular moment, or a best journey.
They're also for us to be a week for a week in the october, and how we change our time and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical but in all of us.
Because though we do this same image, we're going to change our perspective of mal. While they always reach new miles, I'm always seeing it with their eyes, and how they see it.
These very intense, the very intense, we're spending together, and every year we've been free.
Last, while after a surprising, we went to a suddenly, and suddenly, they're going to show them how they're going to show up a red market, they'd like a pupplications, when they love to be smaller.
And she told me about their feelings that they had been five-year-old, and this senses of these same thing.
She said they remember how to remember the heart of the brust, as they were remember the launch.
And now she looked at New York, because they want to study because they want to study in New York.
And I was smart, the most important thing we all know what we all do all the memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you, an active responsibility in the most expective results.
I don't know how it looks like this, but I'm going to look at this 15 pictures, I'm on a families.
I'm always the picture.
I want to tell you about today today with you today, and you don't want to ask youn't say, "Where are you going to do?"
Thank you.
