When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the closed to the closed to the closed.
My father heard on his little radio, gray, the news, the news of the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual, because it was unusual, because the news.
He called "The Taliban are female."
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father was very happy.
"Yes can you go to a real school," he said.
I'm not going to forget that I'm not forget.
One real school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I was bottom, and they spent the school.
And so I was smallpointing for five years, and I started my older sister, and I started my older sister, not to a secrets, to a secret.
Only, we could go to school.
Every day, we could never get another way, so that no one way, no one way we couldn't get anyone.
We hidden our books in the books in the income, so we would just look like this.
Our story, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small women.
In the winter was incredibly, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all know that we all know that we all know that we're allowers, teachers and our parents.
In the bottom of the difference, it was a week, because the Taliban powered the Taliban power.
We never know how much they were never know how much they knew.
Do they followed us?
Did you know where we're going to know where we're going to?
We had afraid of still, but we wanted to school.
I had a big decided to grow up in a family as important as important as important and daughter.
My grandfather was his time.
One of the outside of a decided provinced province Afghanistan. He was to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and he was sending his father.
My founded mother was born.
That's what they do.
Two years ago, they went to the rest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhoods.
And my father -- this was the first thing that he was the first in his family, who ever had a schoolboard.
For him was clear that his kids would be a children would be a children, even though, even though, despite of the Taliban, despite all risks.
He looked like a much larger risk of his children don't look at school.
I know that I'm sure that I was in the Taliban sometimes, sometimes, and sometimes from our lives, and the perspective and the perspective,
I had to give me to give me to me. But my father said, "Tauter, you can hear me. You can hear.
Your money can be done. You can be in war in war in war in war.
But one thing is always getting you always getting here. And even if we have to stay with our blood for your blood for your schools, we're going to do that.
So -- so, you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that was growning through decades of wars.
Less than 6 percent of my age of my age of my age, a higher than the second, and if my family, and if my family, and if my school, I would have been able to be a women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a strong Abury College.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was the grandfather who was sended by his family because he was to school, because he was to school, one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first thing that made me greater.
He doesn't just like my high school, but also the first woman, but also I was the first woman who was the first woman who was the first woman who was danger.
My family believed me.
I have a big dreams, but my family has a bigger animals for me.
And so I'm global messages for 10x10, a global campaign for the world.
And so I've helped, SOLA to green, and maybe a single parents in Afghanistan, afghanistan, a land where the girls, and still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students of my school with great early early chances of chances.
And to see how their parents and fathers and fathers for them, as I was also a little parents for me, and I decided to make all the time.
It's like Ahmed. That's not going to show his face, but I can't show his face is the father's the father of my students.
A few months ago, and heimed on the home of SOLA in their village, and they're just a bombs on the roads in the road.
When he got home, he came home, the phone and a voice threatened him, if he was sending his daughter, they would try to school.
And he said, "The kills me, if you want to get me to the future, but I'm going to sit down the future of my olderly and more olderly and more olderly and overcome."
What Afghanistan, so I realized something that I've been able to get something that's going to be able to be the most success, the success, the success, the value of our daughter, and the value of their success is that it's success is that its success.
That's not successful role in our mothers in our success.
These are the ones are the ones that are the ones that are convinced and convinced for a much more powerful for the future of their daughter. But as the future of the in Afghanistan is the men invisible.
Our taliban was just a few hundred mice hundred mice -- because it was ever illegal.
But today, but today, three million girls, three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America,
The Americans are recognize how we are solutions are change.
I don't think that change is not by the change of definitely changed the U.S.
But if I looked in Afghanistan, if I look at the school, and I see the school, and their parents that they're a very parents that they're going to look at a much long-long piece of future and a lot of future and a lot of change.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope and the unfortunities, and the unfortunities, and I remember the girls who are the SOLA.
And as I have a big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, also, also, my life -- my life -- my life -- my life in Africa than young man.
In 1971 to 1971 to 1971, I'm not -- but I'm not -- I've been working in Sambia, the Elbia, algeria, algeria, algeria, the technical countries with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project that we were in the legs that we were on the legs.
I was a doubt.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're going to be good working in Africa, and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we killed everything we fiber.
Our first project that my first project, which my first book called Ripples on the cambezi" inspired by the people we wanted to show people, as nutritional food.
We came together with a countered South South South Asia; in this to Sambia, which leads to the Sambia. We teambia. We teachers, and we learning the populationalian tomata and tomata and Zucini.
Of course, the answer had no interests, so we don't pay for the work, so we could pay for the work, and sometimes they were also in the work.
We were amazing that there was a such a so early no country.
But instead of question, why they didn't say anything, we just said, "God, we're just here!"
"Gerade a real time to save the people to save the people who save the people who save the collection."
Of course, of course, in Africa.
We had this practices. In Italy, they were so big, they were so big, they were so big.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Look, "Look, like simple country."
When the tomata, and red, and redes overnight, about 200 nights from the river and asking all.
We said to the sambian: "Oh God, the nilpferred."
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have country."
"Why didn't say, "You don't say, "You've never asked us."
I just thought we were so great in Africa, but then I saw in Africa, I saw what the Africans, what the Englands, which the French, what the French, I saw what they did, I was pretty strong.
We felt the narrowing the nilp.
They should see the insane -- you should see the uncertainly nothing that we don't have to be african people.
They should be the book "Tead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyoyoyoyoyoyo.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have given the African continent 1.5 trillion euros in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been telling you.
Let me just to read their book.
Let me tell you about an Africans have been a story.
We western people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, and there are only two species, and we're patriarch.
Both words from the latines from the latines," which means "Father" means.
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchal: I'm treated a different culture, as if they were my children. "I love you."
Patronizing: I'm treated a different culture, as if they were my service.
That's white people in Africa, and the Bwana, Chef, Chef,
I was growing up when I was a book called "Small," by small," by swallower, especially, if people don't want to help people don't want to get a help.
This is the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help of the help.
Today, the morning of the heart of the conference that conference, and asked a stabories, "Can you're going to imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to people, and it's been able to reaction, and he never fundamental company, never motivated, no one has ever been initiative, but you're going to the pion of the pion of the pion of the pion of the pion of the disturbories of the pion of the
What you do -- you're doing -- you're doing it.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're going together with the units.
We don't work from Bure.
We're going to meet in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Cneips.
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally find out friends and find out what the person who wants to find out what the person.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can someone who's an idea.
If that person doesn't like, what do you do?
The passion for the personal growth of person is the most important thing.
The passion for the passion is the most important of humanity.
We help them finding it, because no one can't find anyone can be successful.
The person with the idea hasn't the knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, why I had this instead of telling you about what they should do in a community and say, why don't hear them, why don't we hear them in community.
Let me give you a secrets.
There's a problem with community.
In entrepreneurs have never been shared, and they will never say what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see.
Planovery has this blind flow.
The most course, the community of community because they never seem to public true.
We're working to do this, to do this, to make this social infrastructure infrastructure that don't existed.
A new board to created to be created.
This is the house, the house, the house, the house, who's in the house that you're in your caf<unk> and in the caf<unk> sitting in the caful and find your passion in a way that you can transform your passion in a way that we're transforming.
I have this in food, I tried to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do this in the West Australia, I tried to try to do this in the West-Australia, I tried to try to do this in the West-Australia, I tried to do.
I promoved to do that, and I tried to get the time and trying to decided to do what they should do.
And so I went to help me to help us to help us to help me to help me to help me to help him. I'm going to help him. He was maybe he was maybe he was maybe he was mori. I'm going to sell himself and selling them.
I'm going to help us to work together and helped them together, and they don't know, a factory in Albany for 60 cents, but to Japan for 15 dollars for 15 dollars for 15 dollars."
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I'm hold the mouth and hold."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Make it again."
We've made it into 300 communities.
We've helped 40,000 company.
There's a new generation of companies that are in a common.
Peter printer, one of the best companies of the best company, starting with 96.
Peter printer printer was philosophyprofessor, before he said, "Peter printer printer printer printer printer printers invinable to reality and the economy and the economy and economy."
Plano is the death is the entrepreneurs.
So you built create car, without knowing what the clearly human Christching the car.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to a piece of that.
You have to help them discretion and privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them to help them getting bad.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the intelligence?
For what predicts have you on most of the most applauday?
<unk>uite, eventually, you have applauded.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we're fossil fossil fuels, fuels, and systems that are systems that are not systems that don't have sustainable.
The burning powerful machine is not after.
The Freon-Arts of instantly.
We have to look at how we look at seven billion people on the seven billion people, cure, cure, cure, correcting, and we can correspond to them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will be invention for the green revolution? Universities? Universities?
The government? Because you're forget!
It will be entrepreneurs. And they're doing now.
I read a food story in a food story in a fooduristic magazine.
There was a group of experts that were in the future of the future of New York in the city of New York in 1860.
In 1860, they came together and speculated in 100 years with the city of New York, the city. The city was a city: The city wasn't exist.
Why? You saw the curve, and they said, if the population in this tempoint in this tempo, they needed to be six million paths to be able to required to the people who are impossible to be able to be able to be finished by six million paths.
Because they went on the master.
1860, they see the worst technology that's life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001, there were 1001 cars -- 1001.
The idea that another technology to find a different technology had made the running little factory. It was little factory.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
When he has to be able to get them.
Otherwise, they don't talk to you.
So next thing you have to pick them up, engaged, engaged and economic service.
And then you have to give them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the little biggest company, all of the largest company, three things: That's to sell the product.
Do you know?
We never met a single person who can produce the same time, and we're going to sell the money, and they can care about the money.
That's not exist.
These person was born.
We've seen research and we looked at 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford the new companies, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle,
There's just one thing that allowed all of the world that have been a communities of the world, just one: No, just one person.
Now, let's teaching 16-olds in Northumberlands of entrepreneurs, and we start to give them the first two sides of Richard Branson Autobiography. The first two-year-year-olds. The first two-year-year-olds of the first two-year-year
No one time, and 32 times "wir" and 32 times.
He wasn't alone, he started.
Nobody green a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we create a community, in the community that will have a little bit of the background, in Caf<unk>s and bars and bars.
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you sell on the money?
"Oh, no, I don't know that I don't you." "Make someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We've got groups of freedoms that can be support the companies that can help them to help them to help them to help them out of the middle of the intelligence of the intelligence of the population of the population and the economy and the economy and the economy and the econ
Thank you.
I've got to be five years ago, how it must be in the wounderland.
The Penn State University, a Docentin for communication -- a communication -- in communications --
I had anxiety --
It's really afraid of this students with their big brains and their big brains and their big books and their big books and their big well-dictionary.
But as the conversation of the conversation, it turns out to me as Alice, when they looked down to the cannins and a whole new world, and a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I felt conversation with the students. I was amazing. I was amazing about the idea that they had another minds that they had this wonderlands.
I think that door to open up these door, it's great communication.
We need inequality of great communications of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the largest problems, like the environmental and health and health and health and health, and if we don't understand that it's not something that it's not going to believe that it's not really important.
But these great conversation doesn't get to knowledge, if our scientists and engineers and engineers.
So scientists and engineers, clearly, clearly.
I want to show you a few an approach to show you that we can see that we can see that the science and the technology and technology and technology and technology and spaneous.
The first question that you have to answer is, is, is, is, and?
Says, why don't just know why scientific areas, is so relevant for us.
Say not just that their drawings, but they also tell us that they say that you can also tell us that you can also treat the masks, because it's important structure in our cooking, because it's important to understand ooporosis.
And if you do that, what you do is, then you're avoidet Fachwords.
Afterwards are a hands of minds of minds.
Surely, you could use it could use it, and why, but why don't you just don't just say, "Ra and time," which is much different for us?
Our brain is to make your thoughts is not the same as their nive is not the same as their nive.
As an instein's already said, "Make things like this. But not just as possible.
You can tell us something about your scientifically, and you have to tell you about embrace compromise without getting compromise.
A few things are couple of things are couple of things: For examples, stories and analogies. As you can pull it into your banned.
And if you're going to do your work, then the stories, then the stories.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stork?
What happens when someone else? Are you going to do is another one, and with these points, and with these points.
One slide as this is not just slowly, but also slowly, but also in the language of our brain, and we're going to be able to do it.
So this example of genes of genes of genes is much of genes is much we're very special structure is that the special structure of the trade, it's even the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration for the only design of the effective design of the effecture of the effecture of the effecture of
The trick here is to use a single simple, just to use the public space where the audience, if it can be used to related to the fact that can also use pictures and graphics and graphics and graphics and creating a deeply a deeply a deeply a deeply a
These are just a few an approach to help us to see these door, and the door, and the wonderlands and the technology and the technology and the technology and the technology.
And so the engineers I've been undergressed with me, I've been able to make me to connect with me."
And it's also a science of your stories and your pieces and your piece of your piece, so this is the relevantage, so the audience, and multiplicated the publicly important to yourself, and it's incredible working on it. And he's incredible. And he's.
So scientists and engineers and engineers, if you've got me clearly unbelieved me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy, you can films of humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone can tweet a message, and a protestail in Egyption in Egyption.
And with a handy can take a song, it's high-loud and collapse.
All of that is possible.
I'm a year 1984 and live in 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people for change in the streets and the streets and the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989 and imagine and imagine all these people who had been in 1989, and change change, a handy in the cell phone.
Who is a handy has a handy?
If you're going to kep.
Hold your hands, you're hold it up.
If you get it up. One and a blackberry, a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy and my handy and my life.
And I'm going to talk about it.
These are 35.830 cells.
Rohdata.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006,
This direction is called Rightlinia relationship.
And this relatives that every phone is that every phone in Europe, every in Europe, every Internetdle in Europe, a bandwidth, a bandwidth.
Who's going to do? Who's a little bit?
Who short, who is a text?
And if you use a cell phone where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years of your phone, or your phone or your Internetanbiety or your Internetanbiety or your Internet.
And everywhere in Europe, people are in Europe and said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's what we don't want to say, "That's what we want to say, "That's what we don't want to say, "That's what we don't want to say,
They said, we wanted to say that intrigation doesn't want to do that.
We want to be self-building in the digital time, and we don't want the phone netdes and information about all of these information about us.
There were an applices, Journalists said, "Theype that all said, "That's not going to do."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of mountains and said, "Freedom and said, "Freedom."
And some people said, "The might be able to stasi 2.0.
The stasi was the secrets of the secrets.
And I asked me if that really works.
Can you really know all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone, I asked my phone who was the greatest telecom, the biggest telephone in Deuter, and I asked her, and I asked me to ask me, and I asked me.
And I asked her and asked them and asked them and he didn't get a real answer.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is protocols.
So I decided to do a decided to do this information, because I wanted to have this information because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said no, no, we're going to give you this information.
And at the end of it came to a compared with them.
I'll just pick up to me where they all send me all of me to me.
Because in the twice of the bundamental reflection of the emotion of the E.U.
So I got this hold this high-classive environment.
And on the CD:
35th of 19830 cells.
First, I looked at it, and he said, it's a huge datei.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this datei.
So I was a little bit of a little bit about what should I start to start?
Because you see where I'm sleep, where I'm doing.
But then I said, I want to go to the publicity to go to the publicity.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people who are doing the prediction of the powerful.
So with time, with time, and open Data City, so I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can recalled and radiooms, you can pulations and you can pulations.
You can do any step, I can do, and you can do.
And you can see how many of the Frankfurting from Frankfurting the stuff, and how many ancestors.
All of this information is possible information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just like this, and I called me and she calls me, and we're talking to each other.
And then I called me a few friends and they call it a couple of friends.
And after a while, and you call it and you call this huge, and we have this huge communications.
But you can see how people communicate people with each other, they're going to get to each other, when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You know, you know, you know, you know, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
When you have access to this information, you can control the society.
This is a building planning for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect defection of how to growing a society about who knows who know who's a little bit about who has a possible when you're going to do that, all of this information.
And these information are going to be information for months, in Europe, in Europe.
As I said to the beginning, we asked that all these people in the streets in the street in 1989 hands in 1989 hands.
And the stasize of the stasize that was in the demonstration of the state of the stasi, and if the leaders who are never happened to be the leaders, that maybe that would never happened.
The case of the mountain minerliner Mauerlin.
And even thought, the case of the ice.
Because today, because of the companies and companies, so many information, how they want to know how they can get toline and often online.
They want to have the opportunity to reflect our lives, and they want to remain it all the time.
But even though, even a lifetime and a lifetime, is no words.
But you have to do for the self-bestimate self-based today.
You have to fight every day, you have to fight.
So if you go home, you say that Privacy, you're a value of the 21st century is not old-century.
If you go home, if you say, you're going to say, just because companies and state companies and state the possibility, they have too longer information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you're asking your phone society that they've talked about you.
So in the future, every time you use every time you use your handy, you remember, you remember that you need to remember the digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituogenes, snaurants, broke books, books.
So the city planners do, and so they're survived South Central South Central to change it for something else, it change, it change in South Los Angeles, what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituogenes, snaurants, broke broke broke.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the home of the Driven home of the Driving the drive-bys.
The comic is that the drive-thrus more people killed more people killed the drives.
People die in South Central Los Angeles attacks.
The fat, the fatty is in my fourths is pretty higher than five times more than about 15 miles, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't see that more withans.
And I asked me, how you would feel like you wouldn't have access to healthy food when you'd have a healthy when you see out of the house that negative effects that are the best effects that are on your fourth system.
I've been buy role instruction and sells and sells like built.
I see Dialysecond dysecutes like starbucks like starbucks.
And I've heard that this is that it's got to stop.
I caped that the problem is the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And also, I had no luster, I had no luster, I had no loss of four-field to get appled to pesticides in presented in presented in presented in presented.
So I plant food a food-worest.
It's a piece of land that we call parkanels.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is the thing is the city is the city.
But you have to pick it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is because it's my responsibility and I have to stand."
And I decided to kep it into stands.
So I came up and my group that l. A.A. Green ground, and we started together, and we started to plants, and own food, so that's all the program, so the whole program, so the whole program, so that's all program.
We're a kind of a sort of group, we're collapse from all of social signs and all of the city, it's completely free, and it's costs, and it's cost.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone who's a little bit.
The city came to me and he was practical and he said, I said that I had told me that I had to get my garden, I had to be a richerful in a richter.
And I thought, "Come, really, really?
A remembers of foods, because of foods of foods on a piece of land that's going totally matter?"
And I thought, "Cool. Hero."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The L.A. Times window of it. Steve Lopez Lopez Lopez and talked to the city and talking to the city of Green. They were fiber, and you're going to change a petition on Change.
We thought that you had to get in the hands.
My city rather than that, and he said they're support it and said they love what we do.
So why should they do that?
L.A.A. has in the United States, most brought in the city of the city.
They're in 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
That's enough flower to plants to plants to plants.
Why wouldn't find that if they don't find it?
And by the field of a plants, you get 1,000 samples.
With green Bohs in the walls of a dollars, you're going to be own value of 75 dollars.
It's my healing, I say, I say they should be suggest food.
His own food is to build your own money to print your own money.
You see, I have a powerful in South Central.
I grew up there. I grew up there.
And I remember, part of this precious reality, and I reality that was made by other people who were my own reality.
You see, I'm a artist.
Garden is my graffiti. I plant my art.
And just like a graffiti-constrator who is beautiful, I beautiful, I'm a parkanels and parkanels.
I use the garden, the Earth, and the plants, and the plants and the trees and the trees are my connections for these stuff.
They would be surprised, what the earthing that if you can use it as a limbs.
You can't imagine how he's amazing a sunlums, and how they're touching people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden to an instrument for the responsibility of my fourths.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wonderful how children are being influenced.
Garden is the therapistic and creative and cool, and you can do, especially with the city.
And also, you know, you get earthquake.
I remember that time, when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30. They were in my garden, and I came out and I came out.
I've feel really bad, because they were really bad because they were there, and I said, "Wis are you, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been looked at people who were looking at people who were so close to me, and that's just asked me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you don't have a fear."
And I said, "Thum teuff, no, I don't have anxiety that they're doing.
And it's not too is on the street.
But that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it back to me, I want to take their health."
I was a different time, I lived in this obviously in this obdddown LA.
These are the guys who have helped me to decided to decided to decided to decided to get the guys.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it has been able to see how they've been able to see her mother and her grandmother and it was a great mother, and it was a great moment.
Green reason has been plants have been plants.
And we came up with our environments, and they were so 50 people and they're all free volunteers.
When kids, if you're eating children.
When they smells, they eat, they eat.
But if they're nothing about it, if they're not just shown, if they don't get food and body and body and body, they're just food, they're always you're always you're always you're always.
I see young people who want to work, but they want to stick up in this thing -- I see -- I see the paths that are the exactly the exactly the path that is never seen, and they're never seen.
The gardens, I see the opportunity, where we can train these children, to care their communities to care about a sustainable life.
And if we do that?
We could get the next George Washington Carvern'ton Carvernment.
But if we don't change the earth's not going to change the nevertheless.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole walking on garden plants, where people can share the same blocks.
I want to take schipscontainer and they turn into healthiers.
So don't understand me.
I don't talk about cost-cost-cost-cost-cost-cost-triguous.
The comics is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about people who are giving people, and children from the roads, and they're going to let the streets, and the early, and if you're going to be built its own food, and if you opening.
So what I want to do is to do is to do is this.
I want to know that we all want to all ecological rebell, Gangster gangster garden.
We have to picture of gangsters.
If you don't have a gangster.
Are you going to smelling with 'clar?
And let's get the weapons the election.
When you want to meet with meeting meeting meeting me when you want to do in refrigerators and make a meeting and make a meeting, where you want to do something about it.
When you want to meet meeting your selly, you can get to your garden, so that we can plants, so we can plants.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite sounds in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No university."
While, even though, a century, and it's a better distance, "It's a better distributed," is someone who's a center, undependently independently independently independently, and its power of power.
I don't have an expection," is "speakeral."
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians that they need to know that they're trying to control.
For example, for example, for example, the British plament, the British places don't have the exact same words.
And that was actually going back to the mother's actually a man with the man with the extraordinary name Brass Crosby, who was crosby,
She was helped him in the Tower of London and he was muthority, but he was mutigrant enough to be enough, and he was so much enough, and he was so much in London that he was so much in London.
And only a few years later, we find the first neighborhood for the first powerful as Brass."
Brassed on the English word for bad for bad.
But that's not true. It's not true. It's not true.
But to show you how words and politics and politics, I want to take you to the United States, when they're going to the unpreciate the independence.
You saw the question about how to call George Washington, the state of Washington, which is what to call the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leadership of a republic nation?
And that was infinite longress infinite longress.
And there were all kinds of possible for predictable proposes.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernur Washington, and others, and others, and others, and others, and others of the freedom of the United States of America Washington.
Not as a presentation.
Some people wanted to call him a crazy.
They thought that was aware of it.
They were not even monarchistic, they wanted to a particular time,
It would have function.
But everyone was uncomfortable, because these distribution because these debate 3 weeks.
I've read the days of a senators who are still always writing, "Immer,"
The reason for the representation and the long type of the representation.
The representation didn't want to do that whathington is not going to be him. They didn't want to get him.
Caniguously, and they're going to be able to be able to get it on ideas.
They wanted to him the most extremely, yes, the most person who give them a fellow to them.
This title was "President."
President. They don't existed the title. He existed. But it meant that someone eventually, but he's sense of a values.
It's like the prediction of a Jury.
He didn't have more size than the recording "Apartment or "Apet."
Sometimes, there were predictions of little colonial communities and government, but it was really an unbelievement, but it was really an unbelieved title.
That's why the senate of the senate.
They said, "This is smiling, you can't president.
This is a must have to write different countries and exploring and meeting citizens.
Who will take him to take it, if he's going to take a thumbs like President of the United States of America?"
And also after three weeks, the senating.
Instead of course, you know, the title of the course of the course of the clearly, but they wanted to be absolutely not available to their own respects and methods and methods and methods and methods and methods, whether it's, whether it
You can learning things about three interesting things.
First, I think that's the best -- I don't have to figure out whether the senately, whether the title president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just going to get the title. He was just going to be able to be the senates.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something that is something that's a little bit more -- then you're also 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important point, that's the most important point, the Title, the United States of America," is not so clearly clearly condition, right?
This has something more than 5,000 nuclearly than 5,000 nuclearly, and the biggest volcope and a flying volcy of the world and a piece of the world.
I really have given the title of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the title.
And so the senat at the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the
They have a respectables of title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of embrace -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to sound how the classrooms like the 5,000 nuclearly,000 nuclearly.
So at the end of the senat and the representative, because no one has lost never lost no one who feels like a head of the president of the United States of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with what I'm going to do with.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality and the reality of reality, but actually change the reality of reality, the reality of reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelly to campaign for a 19-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-oldarian Surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to look at my black carbonverse couple of couple of latters and celebrate and celebration pancial carrying pancial.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was a long time, I was a great pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama, and the walls and fighting and fighting and religion-control-control.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to do this, I've been created southern Proletes, Southeists and atheist and atheist and atheist and atheist, and atheistan who's been working in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do is a lot of great things that you couldn't do any routes, but I don't like to make a personality, I want to make the personality and car and car and car and car and car and car and reportation and reportation and reportation and reportation and report and re
I want to spend a day in life of a dihad -- Gangstery who spends on his dying his dying communists like <unk>Popstar Bling" and political corruption and political corruption and political corruption and political corruption.
And what else can do is doing the Derminister than for the Parlament to make a choice and a choice and a choice with the slogan: "Whad and I'm doing it."
And trying to use these campaign to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosize as nationalheld.
I want to start to start with a phanistan, and they're going to start with a project called "Rideration," and when you look at the policement, and if you're going to streets of cabularly on the streets and cars, but instead of cars, but instead of cars, and carside
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan of my mind, I was after the "modic conflict.
The war and the war and the freezing answered with him, organization, and we created a new environment for struggle and models that you can only a models and self-making collection for soldiers, and self-fordator.
And I'd like to see how a simple ships, and I would have been able to cabularly from 1899, and it's a dialogue today, and that the figure of the world today, and they're going to colonial retiative to the retiative.
But for all of these things, you can get in prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be missing, missing.
But I do, because I have to do because I need to be lost the geography of self-long.
That's my last. What is your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and several times, I've been working as a model.
Since 10 years, right now.
I have the feeling that now in the room, I've built a unfortable spanning, because I hadn't supposed to do this clothes.
I've luckily, I have something to change.
So this is the first time that someone on the TED stage on the TED stage, so you can see, so you can see, so I think you can see.
If you were really a few women were really exploring, when I wasn't need to tell me that I don't need to twitter.
I also realized that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very shortly, because I can think about 10 seconds.
And it doesn't have anyone who has chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I wanted to make them such asking them.
The hardest part is to create the pullovering my head, because then you'll be able to do all of you will do nothing to do with my head.
In order to be in order to be in order to be in order to do.
Why did I do that?
That was possible.
Now, it wasn't hopefully as this picture.
One of powerful, but an image is also an image is also operating.
I just have just changed your opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never really never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photograph told me, I told me, and I would fit in the hair and I could fit in the hair.
And from operations or the surgery or the wrong brunks ago, two days ago, there are only two days, there's only a few opportunities, and our qualities, and our quality, although it's operately, although it's an impact on the surface.
To being able to be honest today, today.
And I'm stage on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm stage on this stage because I'm a high school, and I know a woman who called the woman who call this a sexy Mirl.
I'm going to ask the questions that people who are always standing up the real way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that means nothing.
The real reason I was a melodel, is a money, and a mattery and maybe a very important equivalent of this exactly what it is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have beauty, we're not just as healthy and young and young metrically programmed, but also we're also programmed, but also finally, and they're finally finish.
This is a created for me. And it's an explaining for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audienceptic. And maybe some maybe some models, and maybe some maybe, "Hal. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Small. Liu Walls."
And first, I'm going to comments, I'm going to be affective.
But unfortunately, I have to share that in 2007, a very extractoral death of the NYU, the nYU all models on the single money, and that's been booked by 67 or not only 27 or not only 27 or not only 27 or not only 27 or not only knows.
The next question that I always said, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm a models?"
And I went to answer, "I don't know, that's not know, it's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I really want to girls really want to girls really, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be.
You can be presidentin of the U.S. or the inventor of the next Internet or a ninja Herzchirurg-Da-Da-dright, because then you would be dead, because then you would be the first thing."
When they still says, "No, no, no, no, no, no, I want to say, "No," I want to say, "Who."
Because I don't have anything and you couldn't do anything, the Chefreditors of American business or the next sensation of H<unk>amp;M or the next side of H<unk>amp;Meisel.
And you say that you're going to be a model is so, you'd say that you want to say that you want to win the Jackpotto.
You can't confluence it's not affective and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, because of the model-control, because it can only be different than hearts to be able to do it.
When you get to be a photographs and the light is exactly the nice, and you're going to be a picture, and the cameron, and then you want to go back to the legs, and then you go to the legs, and then the legs, and that's going to be able to get this arm, and that's going to the arm.
It looks like this.
Hopefully comically than that.
That was .... I don't know what happens.
If you're going to slide and a life and a few jobs, you can't do a lot of jobs, if you want to say that you want to say that you want to be prediction, but in the United States, "10 years," and then you'll see it comes to the melixed.
The next question that I often question is, "Who's all photos.
And yes, so pretty much all the photos, but that's just a little part of the story of the story.
That's all the first photo that I didn't even the first time I was also the first time I was a bikinio. I had no idea that I hadn't even my periode.
I know that's pretty personally, but I was a young girl.
And so I just looked at a few months before, with my grandmother.
I'm on the day, I'm on the day.
My friend had to start me.
I'm on a pyjama Pyjama Partyjama Phooting for the French Vogue.
I'm with the football team and in the v-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not a pictures of me.
It's constructs and it's constructs of profession, from profession, from Have and Make-up-up-up coasts and photographs and photographs and the prediction and the prediction.
Okay, asking me, people always ask me, "Come things are you going to do things?"
Yeah, I've never going too many 20-covery that I never meters I never meters I'm not going to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge and I went to a day, and I was forget in a launched my money, and you had to give me the clothes.
When I was teenager, I was in my friend, a river, and it was a red launched a red launched a red launched. It took a patience, "I needed to get a patience," and we could go on.
I have this cost of my costs of my exception, and not because of my personality and there are people who don't know what they're people who don't know because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last decade, and they were 85 percent swareness and latinos and latinos and most of young men.
It's live in New York,000 young, men, men, men and latinos, for the question, "Who I'm going to ask me?"
But I'm going to say, "How often do I get to stop? When I'm going to stop?"
I found that I found out of this talk about this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year percent when they're 178 percent when they're 178 percent when they're 178 percent.
The last question is, "How is, how is it, it's a model of a model of this?"
And I believe they expect that answer: "If you're a little bit of thinner and longer and longer, you feel very happy and feel very happy and fabulous and fabulous and fabulous."
And Backstage, we might be answer that maybe this event.
We say, "It's really great, and it's greative, and it's greative, inspired, inspired people."
All that's true, but it's just the half of the story, because what we never said before the camera, which I never said, "I feel that I never safety is, I feel like, "I feel safety."
And I feel like to feel that I have to think about my exception.
And if you ask yourself, "Would I be happy if I have happy if I had thinner legs and limited hair?"
And then you should meet a few money, because they have the thinner cool, because they have the most free and the most coolest coolest coolest clamots and they're the coolest clamothes.
When I didn't even have this talked about this talks to me, it's really difficult, because of a very honestly, because of a very until I felt very until that I got very until you all know, I got to say, "I got all the benefits. And I got it to my grandchild. And I got it was the most fundam
It was very difficult to be a very difficult, an expression of uncertainly and race, if I'm one of the largest non-time non-traord.
But I'm also happy and I feel like this, and I've been able to do it, and I think it's great that I've been able to do it, or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 30 years, because then I wouldn't really excited to tell me.
When you take a little bit of this talk, then we all have the power of the power of image in our power of imagine and mistakes and mistakes.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother, who never forget the exilienced in the exilience, "Son, evi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafire.

Junge, libysche and men and men and men in the first range of the first ruled the end of the regimes, the freedom, the freedom, and social general power.

They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the Middle East, from the most farm.
And finally, after a months of six months, and almost 50,000 dead, and it's almost 50,000 tyrane and the guyrane.
But Gaddafi, but a big cities, a large corruption of the tyranne, the corruption and the basically.
Four decades, Gaddafis tyrannic regime, the infrastructure, and the infrastructure and the culture and the moral structure of the lybic society.
The desertification and the challenge and the challenges, I realize how many other women, I realize how many other women's civil society of local civil society and we're going to do democracy and national equal equal equal equal equal equal equal equ
So in 200 organizations were taken in 200 organizations, and unmed Statefishing in Benghafisci, almost 300 in Tripolis.

With a wonderful group of women and women, I was the peaceby strong women, a movement of women, leaderships, leaderships, it's public public strength of the public strength of the public strength of the publ
I met the paying I met a very difficult environment, a very hard, a collective, an environment, an environment, an environment, which was a politics of dominance and exploring.
I was suffering a sative of peace and women's a women to reach away with a laws, and a laws, a laws, a laws, no matters, and the right hands and citizens and citizens and citizens and creating and choice and citizens and
At the end of our initiative, and it's successful.
Women women women, 17,5 percent of the National choice in the first choice for 52 years.
But slowly, but the euphory of euphories and the whole revolution, and the whole day, we wake up to news of violence.
One morning, we expect to the money, we're going to changes and Sufi-Grali-Grban.
And another morning a morning the morning about the murdership and the message and the message.
On the morning the morning of officients of the poor.
And really, we're going to grow up under the milize of milize their milize their milities and their opportunity and their power and their power and laws and laws and laws.
Our society, created by a revolutionary, polarized, polarized by the ideal and principles of the ideal and principles, social general, social general.
Intolerancy, excuss and roach and Rache to the Icones of the question.
I'm not there today today today with the success story of our redesigned the recognize of our recognize.
So I'm here today, I'm here today, when a nation that we've metrong choice and the wrong choices.
We've been looking at our priorities.
Because the choice was a north or security or security or security in Lybia.
Didn't the recognize of the change between female and men and men and men's birds and national personal values?
No, she didn't.
What is it?
Why is going to continue to polarized and dominated by itself, and itself, and the dominance and the dominance and the dominant and the men and women?
Maybe the women't the only thing that has dangerous, but the female values, the female values, the gnade and the including and the including the board.
Our society needs a national dialogue, and consumer, and consumer than they've been brought the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of two decision and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative recognition of the female of the female, quantitative recognition of the female.
We have to stop in the name of the name of the name of the roach and a day of the roach.
We have to start in the name of the middle of the gnade.
We have to develop a female discurs that wouldn't just to do the following, but also to do it, but also to work on, collaboration, collaboration, collaborative conclusion, a conclusion, instead of statts.
These are the ideal that is a completely crossss of war, to requires to reach peace to get peace.
Because the peace has an alchemic and in this alchemic and in this alchemistry, and maskulines and maskulin sweets.
This is the real recognize of recognize.
And we have to do that, we need to do it before we do it before we do it.

When I was small, I thought, my country, and I grew up with the long "Nothing with the song.
And I was very proud.
In school, we picked the story of climate Il-ship, but we don't learning about the world, extraordinary, America, South Korea and Japan our fine.
While I often asked me, I was often asked me, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, I would spend all the time.
And so, I saw seven years, I saw a public head of public he thought, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to live.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter of the sister of the sister of a collegin.
Darin stood up, "If you're going to be reading our family members, because we've been for two weeks.
We're going together and our body and our body, and our body, soon as well die."
I was so hocked.
I heard the first time, I heard about that people in my country.
I went to the bottom, I went to the bothofully, and I didn't see anymore.
One lived on the ground, and a board, and a battle child in their arm, and its mother.
But no one hasn't help them because all of them because all of themselves, and they were to care their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big children's a big chorea.
At the end of the end of North Korean of the hunger, and many more than a lot of other than a lot of other than they were just because they were just because they were just because they're just because they're just away.
So included, always been more likely to get me totally relatively to me, extraordina on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the same thing that we live.
I always asked me why they had no lights and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the river of the river, who's part of the bordership between North Korea and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and
As you can see, the river, the river, and it's very simple north Koreaners.
But many died.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't tell a lot about how I can say, but I can say that I can say that I can tell you that I could turn to change the hunger, I was sent to China.
I thought I was a short time of my family for a short time of my family.
I never thought that it would never thought it together to summarize it.
In China was very hard to live in China, without family without family.
I had no idea of what the life as a north Korean flying his life as a northern Corean, but I didn't just extremely difficult, but also very difficult, but also very hard to be very dangerous.
So I lived in strong, I would have been able to fly including me in a terrible, and you would have a bad sends to North Korea.
One day, one day, my biggest alptraum, when I was brought by the Chinese police and in police and in police.
Someone who's possible, North Korean, so they test my chinese and asked me to be my chinese questions.
I had this kind of struggled my heart of my heart.
Would anything that, of course, I could be innatural, I could be innoved and down.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I did, I would make my feelings, and I feel like to control and answered.
After they were asking them with the exception, said, "This was a false.
It's not a north Korean."
And they walked me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreanera in China in China in China, but many of the China, but many of Chinese police and absolutely and down.
These girls had great happiness.
While they were expected, they were expectly finally finally finally finally finally finally finally pressure.
These north Korean didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, until north Koreaner in China and after North Korea, where they're followed to be in the public, or publicly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly high
While I was lucky, I was lucky, it's not so much of other north Koreanists.
It's tragic that North Koreaner and hard to fight and hard to fight up and hard to fight.
And after they learned a new language and work in a new language, it can be in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the hidden of the southern I decided to South Korea, and I started to go back to Southern.
Mich in South Korea, I was a larger challenge, when I had thought it was a bigger challenge.
English was so important that I had to learning that I had to learning my third language.
And I've got the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all the Korean, but inside, we've been very expecting, we've been in the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the corean.
Identity crisisis.
Is I want to South or North Korean?
Where do I get? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no lander, there was no landscape.
While I was the answer to me, I didn't easy, I had no easy, I had a plan.
I'm already for the attention of the university.
I just got took me to my new life, I was a new life, I got a shocking an electricity.
The north Korean boards the money that I started my family, and as a streets, and as a streets, and as a streets to a country.
They had to fast as possible as possible to planning their flies.
North Koreaner has to be an incredible strecke back to their way back to the freedom.
It's almost impossible to over the limits and South Korea, Ironically, Ironically to China and I was going back to China and made me to China and made me to China.
Because my family doesn't have to language, I had to suffering, and then I had to South Asia.
The busycled a week, and we've been expecting more mentioned.
Once, when the bus once, a chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the experience of all, and he started asking questions.
And so, I didn't understood, I thought I was going to be able to get them.
When the Chinese recorded my family, I decided to decided to him, and I said they were doing it, and I said, and I was inspire.
He looked at measured measured me, but believed me.
We did it until it up to the limited, but I had to get all my money to bordership to borders of Laos.
But even after we had the borders had been concerned my family inhafts, because of illegal border.
After I had goney and short turned out, and short, my family inside of a month, but I was in the months, my family, my family in the mainstadian family.
That was one of the biggest running my life.
I had done everything to family to family to freedom, and we were so close to the family, but my family, just the southern Corean message.
I went down and I went through the unexpected and the police and trying to try to try to family, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money or money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man, "What's losing?"
I was completely surprised that a friendly care about it.
In fact, I broken English and with a words, I was explained my situation and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two more money and two more northern Korean to get them out of the prison.
I thanked him from whole heart and asked him, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he said.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The most popularly before community for me to me, for me to me, and it took me to get the North Korean, and he showed me the freezing friendly, and he showed me the company and the international community of the north of the northern Comorean the northern Comorean minderv
And finally, after our long journey, and I was completely records, but the freedom, but the freedom.
Many north Koreanera are being tears and soon as they get in a new country, and soon as they're not going to get a little bit of money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us learning, the education and many mountain and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of us in contact with family, and we're staying with family, and we're going to change them information and money, northern Korea of the northern Korea.
I had a luckily, so much help and inspiration inspiration inspiration in my life that I want to help early northern Corean success.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful north Koreaner, also on the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've just a bit.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very well.
He can't talk about, but he can't communicating for some of the best rather than some of the best rather than that.
Remi know what love is love.
He shared it meant to share them and he's unknown.
It's not just a big. He's not on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences and imagine, and you're just never tells you never tell you a lying.
When he songs from our childhood, I tried to remember the words, I don't even remember one thing: how little we know about the important thing: how little bit about the unknown.
Samuel is 16th is a great. He's very good.
He has an absolutely unfairable memory.
But he also has a selective.
He can't remember if he remember, he remembers, but it remember, but it remember the public each carrying on my iPod, conversation that we had four, when he was four, while the most public four, while the movie.
Do they don't hear incredibly?
But a lot of people don't true.
And in fact, because it's not in society of normal version of normal paste, they're oftended and false.
But what my heart, and my heart, and my soul, although that was the case was that the case, although they were not approached that it was just a case that it was just autism.
Now, for those of you who don't trust that doesn't trust the term, it's autism" is a complex function of the brain, which is a complex funication that can be able to learning and sometimes the abilities.
It's also differently, it's a different individual, it's a different than Sam.
And the world's going to be a new person a new person autism, even though there's one of the world, even though there's one of the world, there's no known for the world, there's no known as a cause of the world, or healing.
And I can't remember the first time I remember, but I can't remember, but I can't remember.
I was borning three years old, when my brother, and I was born, and I was so excited that I had a new weeks in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play how it didn't really interested in the other babies didn't really interested in me.
Remi, and I lived in his own world, and he found in his own rules, and he founded in the smallest things like the little things that little things that are in a series in a series in a settle, and all of them.
And when he was older, he was different and the differences were different.
But behind the wutanted to the writing and the froged hyperactivity was really unique: a very unique: a boy non-controlled, a boy, a boy who had never seen before.
And also, incredible.
Now, I can't learning that there was some of the moments in my family moments that I wished that I wish I wish I wish I wish I wish I would be exactly like me.
But I'm going back to the thoughts that they've learned me to the done Individuality, communication and love, and I don't understand that this is not a normality that I wouldn't want to turn on.
Normality about beauty, the beauty that the differences, and the fact that we're not different, and the fact that one of us is not that one of us.
It's just that there's another way of responsible.
And if I could just tell you a sam and tell you, and then you must be normal and it wouldn't have to be normal.
You know, you know, you can be an extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a stories that we have a stories of us have a striveness, and in all each each each each of the ultimate open-timate open-timate open-timate open.
The chance to the size, research and walls and walls in the moment where we're trying to be another.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgins has taken us to earned to be curiosity, with this photo on the photo on the photo on applected by a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and see the world, and see the world, but a million pictures, but a million pictures per second.
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography, the femto-Femto-field, a new a new approach to the time that they can actually recording to the movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can look at the absurance of our views, or not to look at education or not without a <unk>-ray in our body, and really in our body, and really in our body.
If I'm going to take a laser potential and a billionth of a billionth of the seconds -- that's more and more and more and more opened a package, I'm going to get a millimeter, and that's a millimeter project, and this project, and this project, this project, this project
So if you take this projectil, this project, and it's going to take this photones, and it's going to botones in the flower in the flask?
How does it look like light?
So this whole event,
So, think of it, the whole event that all eventually, it takes a nanoseconds -- so light, so light to get this strong, but I'm going back to the light, but I'm going to see this video to the movement to the light.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financial.
So, in this movie, so you can see that happens to show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, the fly in the fly in the fleet with a photones, and that starts to move up and that's bright.
A part of the light, after outside the table and you see these exercise of the waves.
Many of the photones, many of the last few of the rivers of the rivers and exploding in different directions.
As you can see, there's air, air, which is air.
While the waves are breading the waves on the table and because of the reflexion of the reflexion of the reflexion of the flasks of the flasks.
Now, if you take a projectile projectil, and it's the same strong and the video and the video, and the video, you know, you know, how long you know how long you have to see how long you have to see the movie.
One day, a week? No, a very week.
That would be a very long-long movie -- from a long-long projectil in movement.
And how does it look like a pilotography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the wall is in the background.
It's like if you're in a piece of pond.
I mean, it would be like this, the nature of nature, the photo matter, yeah, but of course, but of course, our eye, of course.
But if you look at this tomate that tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the lights, you will remains these further. It's not going to remain.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and the light in their light into their lights and after a few seconds.
So in the future, if these femto-camera in your camera in your camera, it could be able to go into a supermarket, you could go into a supermarket, if a fruit, if a fruit, no, no report.
So how did my teamera on MIT this camera?
So when you know, if you know, if you know, if you know, if you're doing very little bit of light, but we've got a billion light, but we're going to faster than your course, so you get a light.
So we're doing this is: We're going to send this project, this photones, and we're going to show you that million times, and they're going to combine and these gigabytes of data, and we're going to recognize these femtoos.
And we can take all of these rowates and doing very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hells can make us feel that would be able to do it with a new superher for a new superheroe for a new superheries: to see event?
The idea is that we're trust to the door.
It's going to be able to go back to the room, a part of it will reflecting back to the door, and we could reflecting back to the camera and we could use these more simpler of light.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built it.
Links, you can see our femto-camera.
And the wall is a puppeared, and we're going to let the door.
After our treatment in the "Nature Communication" was published by Nature.communication" was made by natural.coming them.
We're going to get the light projects, and they're going to get together, and they're going to get together, and then you're going to get a little bit of the photones, and then we're going to recognize the light, and then the currently, and then the door, and then the door.
And because we have a camera that's so femto-camera has a few single camera.
She's a very good time, and it can look at the world in light, and it can look at the world.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the door, but we don't know what we don't know what we don't know what the point.
If we can see a laser on the both-producation, and then we can see a picture of the screen, but if we look at the sense of these images, but if we're going to try together, and they're trying together and trying together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got some of the things that we can see the lab, and we can see the practice, we can see the cars, we can see the collision, and we can see what's going on, or we can see in the curve, or we can see what we can see in dangerous course, by looking for us.
But because of the blood and tissue and course, it's very exploring, that's why it's really a way to think about femto-Femto-Femto-Femto-Femto-Femto-field processes.
So, as well as a scientists, even a scientists, and it's a scientists, and we can't be a collection of the ultra-conomics, and I realized that all of these gigabytes that we can't just know what we don't just know.
But it's also happening here.
If you look at this waves under the flower of the waves, you can see that the waves of us.
The waves to move to move.
What happens here?
It turns out that we're almost in light, because we've seen in light, and it's affects and incredibly, and incredibly incredibly.
The recipe that the event in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, so you can relationships, so you can relationships by space and time, so we can relationship, we can correction of space and time.
So, even if you're going to figure out how to create the experience of a new creatures, or new demands of medicine or new demands, we've been able to requires and data and data and data and data and the data and the data and the data and that the data and that we've
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of our opportunities can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighborhood, so that we don't have a lot of ways, but we don't use the same public places.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and share things like After all the time and circularly and circuits.
The projects from my questions from my questions, how much might have my neighbors my neighbors?
How can we each other things, without us, without us?
How can we leave our memory of the buildings and understanding and understandscape?
And how can we share our hope for living homes, so that we share our communities and dreams and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea, my seaf is going to be huge effects that have been hundreds of years, beds and dreams and dreams and dreams and tears. I'm always mission.
I think any time someone, if someone nobody, there's no planet.
In this city is some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the world, most reason for most reason.
I live in the number of this house and I have to survived it. I thought I was thinking about something that my life for something that changed my life forward.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, it was suddenly and unexpected and unexpected.
I thought about death the death, and I was a big disease for my life, and it brought me to me, and it's important.
But it turns me, this sort of views, every day.
It's easy to lose in the attention and forget what really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I leave a huge homework and wrote a huge capture and wrote a sentence: "Bevorite, I want to be a piece of it." Everyone who can be a piece of the both.
I wasn't sure what I was experiment, but I could experiment, but the next day, the next day, and they're always been further.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the people who were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to die, I want to be piratterns."
"Bevorite, I want to die, I want to standing on the International datumbs."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to die for million people."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to plants."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to live "netzunabhancy."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to keeeep them back in my arms."
"Bevaluate, I want to die, I want to be someone."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to be myself."
This is a sense of place, and it was a senseful place, and the hopeful place, and the hope to the laughters and drives me to the hard time.
It's about knowing that you don't know anyone.
It's about understanding our neighborhood and that is a new and in a new way.
It's about the place of the place for remember and remember and remember what we're going to change what we're growing and change us.
I did this last year, and I made a hundreds of neighborhoods that were able to build a community to build a wall. So I wanted to build a colleagues and now I've been built in countries like cashed in Lustral Africa, South Africa, Africa
We've shown how much power our power our power, if we have the opportunity, our voices, and more with others.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with two things with two things that are important than ever before, it's important than ever thinking about the right perspective and think that's really care about it, and that's lives.
We're often going to talk about death to think about death the death to think about it, but I've realized that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that is one of the things that we're most strong.
The idea of deaths of deaths of death.
Our common summon slightly, which is important.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to do with me with me, particular mathematics. One issue to everyone who's applied mathematics are, is that we're like companies are.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to explain the trials to explain what I'm going to explain.
Tances is one of the most human activities.
We're crazy of most of the most popular ballett and seen and seence and same way you see how you're going to see how you're going to see how you're going to see.
At the balletting an extraordinary ballet of capabilities and abilities and abilities and ability to have a genetic context genetic context genetic context.
Traurrically, destroying newurological stories like parkinson, this extraordins. That's what it does it also makes them to be a ballettual stripling, who was a ballettuose.
And over the years, you've made a lot of research for the treatment.
But yet, there's a lot of people who are living in the world that's living on this disease, and they have to live with the unexpected symptoms like symptoms and other disease, and other disease, and that disease.
We have to measure the progressive master, and finally, and finally, and the only way to know if we have a chance if we have answer if we have answer that question that question.
<unk>uite is that there's a parkinson and other movement, you can't have biomarker, so you can't just leaderships. The biombs.
You have to do it in clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very expensive, and that means that's never made the nobody.
But what if patients could do that if patients could do that?
That would be a critical tour in the hospital. What would be patients, what if patients could make these test itself?
It wouldn't be a teensive hospital.
It costs <unk>, 300 percent, 300 percent, in the neurological advantage.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods that we're trying to reach to reach to the sense of sense, because we're all, because we all know, virtuosen, virtuo.
So here's a video of video of vibrating stimmlipping.
That's what happens in healthy when someone spreads. We can look at the conditional balletting ballettings because we need to look at all of these vocide, because we have to coordinate the genes, and we have to do all the genes, and we've all have the genes.
And as Ballets it enormously, it's enormously.
Think about how long a child, how long a child, until it.
And so we can create the position of the vibrating stimming stimming, and as the greatest morgane, and as the stimmorgans.
On the recording to the example of an example of unrecique stimulate stimulate stimulate movement.
We're always see the symptoms.
Voice, swawak, swave.
The language is actually easier and I'm such an example, and that's an example of it.
And this effects that you can be minimal, sometimes, but sometimes, sometimes, and sometimes, and presence and presence, combined with new predators, combined with new masters, and that's very careful learning.
How do these tests with clinical message? Well, they're not both of them are not-invasive.
and also, infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. There's not being the voice, the experts.
So you can be transformed by itself.
They're very quickly, you're maximal 30 seconds.
They're very cheap and we know what that means.
When something extremely, you can also be in big massive amount of a big mass.
And this is amazing goals, we can now get to do this.
We can reduce logistic challenge for patients.
Patients don't have to leadership in clinics.
We can recognize whether it's holding.
We can't get a couple of massive studies for clinical studies and it's first trials and it's really a biggery of the population of the population.
We've got the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease, before it's before it's before it's before it's before it's possibility.
Today, we're doing this direction, we start the parkinson's Parkinson's suns.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of stimulate numbers around the world, to create enough extraction of these goals.
We have Rufnumbers that are private dreivated by a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, or without parkinson, it can be left to get a few center to get a few center for a few center. I'll known to familiar with familiar with familix percent of our goal.
Thank you.
If you look at 10,000 people say,000 people say, can you say, "Well, who's healthy and who's healthy and who's healthy, who don't you?
What do you do with all of these problems?
What happens is that the patient is that the patients, whether these person on parkinson, or not.
Some people don't know it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is really important. These are important, because we're important, because we're really important to parks, which are the real marker for parkins.
At the time, you have 86 percent decision?
It's much better.
My shake it topics -- I have to love it, because he's so fantastic worked -- now, it's also showed that it's also working on the mobile phone, and we're going to be able to do what that projects, and we're in 9 percent decision.
I call this a better.
That means that people can do -- the people can do with the handy on the cell phone with parkinson't get to parkinson't leave their voice, so that you can take the doctor of the disease of the disease of the disease of the disease.
That's what you do.
Thank you. Max Ladies and gentlemen,
Thank you, Tom.
So here's what I live in Kenya on the southern Rand of Nairobi national parks.
In the background, you can see the cows of my father and the national park.
The Nairobi national park is in the south is just in the south. That means that wildlife is that wildlife brasically every time.
The rebuildings that are the solutions, and then they do that. And then they do that.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that were killed. I was killed. I wake up, and I found it was awful bully. It was our only bully.
My stamm who believed in the massai, we believe that we came together with our animals and the we've been came from the sky.
I learned to learned to hate.
Our warrior cured Morans. They're protecting our struggled our heart. They're also carefully, because of this problem.
And they killed the solutions.
Here's one of six solutions that were killed in Nairobian.
And I believe that there are in the Nairobi national parks.
In my stamm is a boy between six years, and nine years, and nine years, and it was also a box.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Lions. Lions for fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to see the cows, but the cows.
But I didn't do it.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to do it with a bird flu.
I wanted to think that the solutions, I wanted to stand.
But solutions are very clearly clearly clearly.
They come up, the birds and go back. And then you go back. But they're going to go and say, "Well, that's still there.
And they killed and killing and killed our viety.
One night, I wake up the case. I love with a fackel in the hand around him and that time, and that's not going to do it.
Lions for the lights for a light that's moving.
I had an idea.
I was working as little boy, I worked all day in my room, and I took a new room, and I took the new room, and I took me to each other. But I had learned me. But I had learned me.
I took an old cars an old car, and a motorcy, and it's a motorcy. The right or left. He wants to be blind.
And I said, "I'm a switch the lights and out of lights.
This is a little broadly a little broke up a capture.
And then I built everything.
The solar panels the battery that battery that battery, the battery. I call it a transformator.
And the direction of the recognize.
You can see that the births, because of the outside, because of the solutions.
And so this is what it looks like if they come to the solutions.
The lights blinking and the solutions and the solutions. I was about the case. I was the time in the bed.
Thank you.
I've been installed installed and since we had no problems.
And then our neighbors of it.
One of them was this great grandmother.
She had many of their animals, and she was lost their animals and she could ask me if I could ask her the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
Since I have seven homes in the neighborhood with the lights and they really good.
My idea is now in the entire creating in all the color, even for other predators like hyes like hyes. The lights. The lights.
My invention, I'm a stip of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse in Kenya, and I'm really excited to be international school, and I'm really excited.
My new school, and I'm going to help and helps and helps and recognition.
I even have my friends with my friends and I've been used together, and we don't have the lights, and I'm not using the people, and I'm using them.
I just a year ago, I just a boy who was high school, who was high-tairplane. I looked at me and said, "I'm going to sit on a sit on a sit on a sit on a sit.
And here's what I'm going to stand up.
I was thinking about airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
When I want to be airplane and pilots and pilots. That's my big dream.
I've got a solutions. But I can save my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the solutions, and we can live in common, side, without strip without street.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language is, I'm going to you.
You don't know what it doesn't know how you're not listening to hear a story like your story.
So you have this stip silence. Yeah.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list of list?
My next experience, I'm working on a electric caunching electric caunch?
Yeah, I know, electrical drawings are already have been invented my own, but I want to have my own.
You've already have to try to try to true -- yes, I've been tried to give it, but I tried to give up, because I got a battle.
All of the beginning is hard Tures, you're a little bit of best.
We're going to get your path, you will start to fire.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm old enough, a camera in the hand, is photography, but I want to share with you today, I want to share with you 15 of my favorite.
There was no kind of director, no chance, no chance, no chance too shoot. Not even the picture. Notice.
In fact, mostly, mostly, mostly, mostly by the tourists were surrounded by the tourists.
My story begins when I was in New York, and my wife, and my wife, and my wife, and my daughter on my first building on my arm. We were on my arm. We were on the ecosing 57th.
And so, we were a year later, we decided to same picture, and so we decided too footprint.
Now, you can see what you can see, what it looks like.
When the thirday, my daughter, my daughter said, "Hey, why do you don't you sabina, and it's a father-time ritual for the ritual for the ritual forting?"
And then we started to do this, we started to make an exists, a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, how universality is when you're going to be a completely fully fully.
Nobody has said no one has said no one has never come too lucky someone with our camera.
And at the time, we didn't know how much of our lives.
And this journey is very holy.
This is just after the 1111, and I had to get after the day, and I had to understand what happened on the day, so that a five-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-old.
These images are much more than just a founder than just a particular moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a week for a week for a week, and as we're going to change our time and how we change our time, not just physical but in all of us.
Because even though we do that, always change our perspective of miles, while they're always reaching new miles, I always see how they're always see how they see it with all about how they look like it.
These very intense very intensive time we spend with each year, and every year we're expecting every year.
Last, while, while one of our rice, we went to the rice, and we're going to stay in a sudden, and they're going to show them how they're going to a puppet, they love to a puppeting, where they love learning.
And she told me about their feelings that they had as five-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-old.
She said they remember it remember the heart of the breast nine years ago when they saw the first time they saw the first time they saw the first time.
And now she looked at New York after high schools because they want to study in New York.
And I realized, I realized, the most important thing we all created memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you, an active role in the most important memory of memory.
I don't know how it looks like this, but I'm looking at this 15 pictures of these 15 pictures of a family.
I'm always the picture.
