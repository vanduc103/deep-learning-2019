When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the sound of heller friends.
My father hearded on his little bit, gray routes, the news.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual, because the news, because the news, because the news.
He called "The Taliban are walking.
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father, but it made my father.
"Well, you can go to a real school," he said.
I'm going to forget about it.
Actually, a real school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I spent sixed it.
And so I five years, I five years, I five years, and I started my older sister, my older sister, who didn't go to a secretch of school.
And so we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way took a different way to do that, so that we went to where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went took a different way.
We hidden our books in the moment to sell our books, so we just walked to sell you.
We've been in a house, we've been in a house, over 100 girls in a small went into a small went into a small went into a small walk.
In the winter was incredibly, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And over again, the university had to be suddenly for a week, because the Taliban, because the Taliban.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Do you want to do?
Where are we going to know where we live?
We had afraid, but we wanted to school.
I had a big happiness in a family, in education as important and daughter and daughter.
My grandfather was his time.
At the outside of a devinced province Afghanistan. He was best, his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- to school and became away from his father.
My based mother was born.
That's her.
Two years ago, they went to the ruhestand, just to turn our house in school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this was the first in his family who ever received a school.
For him was standing that his children would be a children would be a picture, but his daughter, but his daughter, drops.
He looked like a much larger risk of risk, his children don't go to school.
I know that I know that I'm sure that I was in the Taliban, sometimes, by our lives, from our lives, from our lives and the perspective.
I had a good luster, but my father said, "Thather, "Thather, you can lose to your life.
Your money can be carried. You can get your house.
But one thing is going to stay with you, what's going to stay with our blood, and even if we're going to pay for your blood for your blood, we need to do that.
So -- do you want to still still want to give?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that's been destroyed by decades.
Less than 6 percent of the women of my age of my age, a higher than the secondaraby. And if my family, and if my family, I wouldn't have a powerful education.
Instead, I'm standing here today, when you're a proudlebury College.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was missed by his family, because he'd been able to send his daughter to school, one of the first one of the first one of the first, one of the first thing that I'm going to send me.
He doesn't just talk to my high school, but also with my high school, but also I'm the first woman who was the first woman who was dangerously free.
My family believes me.
I have a big dreams, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm global message for 10x10, a global campaign for 10x10,
And so I've helped to green, SOLA, and maybe some internative in Afghanistan, a country where girl in school book, a country where girls still risk.
It's wonderful to see how the students to my school with great ears with great ears with great ears.
And to see how their parents and fathers and fathers for her parents, and I'm going to drop and decided to me, and decided to make the resistance.
So as Ahmed. That's not really his face, and I can't show his face is not ahmed, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
As a month, his daughter and heim on the home of SOLA in their village, and they're the death on the streets of the streets.
When he got home, he came home, and he sounded the phone and a voice, if he sent to school, he would sent to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "Till you want to take me when you want to sit down, but I'm not going to sit down the future of my daughters and talk about your old predictions."
What Afghanistan, so I realized something that I've been able to explore the West, the most often, most of us who have a father who have a father who's a father who's a father who's successful.
That's not success is that our mothers don't play a very important role in our success.
and they're a lot of them are in the people who are starting to convince and talk about a much piece of future, and they're in a society like the in a society like the in Afghanistan, the independent men.
Our Taliban, just a few hundred girls -- because it was the girls -- because it was ever illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how we're going to see.
I don't want to change the change, and I think about during the Abancer is changing the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents that they're going to see their parents that they're going to see a much promise that they're going to see a much long future and a long future.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope and the unlimities, and the unlimities, and that girls me every day, and the girls who are subjects.
And so I think they've got big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do what I do, also, even my life -- my life -- my life -- my life was boyed by seven years of work in Africa as young man.
In 1971 to 1971, I see young, but I'm not -- I'm in Sambia, Kenya, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria and Somalia, algae projects of technological countries.
I've been working for a Italian NRO, and every single project that we put on the legs that we've been able to stop.
I was doubt.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people and good people are good working in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we killed everything we've all fixed.
Our first project, which is my first book called Ripples, "Ripples," inspired by the way that we wanted to show up in the way that we wanted to show how food is built.
We came together with animalia, in South South South South South Sambia, which leads to Sambesi Flussi Fluss of the sambia, and we'd learned the tomato.
Of course, the approach to the an interest insularly, so we pay for working for working for the work, and sometimes, and sometimes they're doing it.
We were amazing that there wasn't a so early days, we didn't have a country.
But instead of asking why they didn't look at why they just said, "God, we just said, "God."
"Great," at the right time to save people save people save the people to save the relationship."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, we had these practices. In Italy, they were so big, so big.
We couldn't believe it and said, "Look, and they said, "Look, like, "Lookship is."
When the tomata, and red, and red, about 200 nights from the flower of 200 night and asking everything.
We said to the Sambian, "Oh God, God, the Nilpfering!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a country, we don't have a country."
"Why didn't you told us?" "You've never asked us."
I just thought we were so deadly in Africa, but then I saw what the Africa, I saw what the Americans did, which made the Englands, what the French, I saw what they did. After they did.
We felt the fightings, we fighting.
They should see the important thing -- you should see the uncertainly the uncertainly African people.
They should read the book "Thead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, she's a sambic economist.
The book was published 2009.
We have the middle of African continent 1.5 trillion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has told you.
Let me just reading their book.
Let me talk about an Africans, which we've got to have.
We're westernally humanists, colonialists, and there's only two species, and we're just two species, and we're patriarchal.
Both words come from the latines, which means "pather" means "Father" means.
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalian: I'm treating anyone each of another culture, they'd love you.
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone each of another culture, they'd be my service.
That's why people are called people in Africa, Chef, Chef, called the boss.
I was growing up when I was a book called the book "Small Island," he said, "So," he said, especape when people don't want to leave them in Ruhe.
This is the first principle of principle.
The first principle of the help is respect.
Today, the morning of the heart of the conference, and asked a stab on the ground and asked, "Can you're going to imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react with people, and he was a system called company called company that never motivated, never motivated, but you'll never motivated, but you're going to be the diction of the pion of the pion of the pion that people who are listening to the pion of the p
What you do -- you do -- you're doing.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're satisfaction with the sky.
We don't work from Bross.
We make us in Caf<unk>s. We make us in Caf<unk>s.
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally finally found and find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out.
The most important is the passion.
You can make someone else.
If these person don't like that?
The passion for the person is the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the passion for the most important of humanity.
We help them finding the knowledge because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea has not the idea, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, why, why, why, why, why do we want to tell people what they do, and people don't hear them to say why don't we listen to them? But not together in communities.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with communities.
And companies have never been part and they're never going to say what they're going to tell their money to see what they want to see what they're going to see.
Planation has this blind flind.
The most familiar people of community, because they never know, because they never seem to be able to make it seems.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new mountain has to be created.
This is the house of the company that house of the bedrooms of the bedroom that you're in your caf<unk> sitting in the caf<unk> sitting your passion, your passion to transform your passion in a way to transform your passion.
I tried this inside, West Australia, trying to try to do this.
I promoved to the time and trying to get out where we're going to do what they're going to do.
And so I just love to the first year, and I had a street and helped us to help me to help him. I him. He was called him. He was Maybe he was Maori. I him, and I him, and I him to sell him to a restaurant.
I hold this fish fish fish, and I don't helped them together, and I don't help us to sell them a factory in Albany for 60 cents, but to Japan for 15 dollars, and they said, "Hilo.
In a year, I had 27 projects. The government, and the government, "How do you do that?
How do you. I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and hold them."
So -- -- so -- so, the government, "Make it again."
We've done it in 300 communities.
We've got 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are increase.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, story, story, story, story, a few years ago.
Peter pressure was philosophy professor, before he was businessor, before he said, Peter said, Peter said, plan, planeter said, in fact, and the economy and the economy."
Planation is the death is the death of the entrepreneurs.
So you build christian without know what the most family, without knowing what the most money and their energy and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these to get this to get to get to a bit of a moment.
You have to do discretion and privacy and privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
So for what presentation is you have the most applaud today?
<unk>respite, empty people. Those you've got applaud.
I want to say that companies are the right way to do the right way.
We're on the end of the first industrial revolution -- night, fossil fossil fossil fuels, and suddenly, and suddenly, and systems that are not sustainable.
The connection of the powerful machine is not sustainable.
The Freon-Aron-Aron-con-content.
We need to look at them, we need to look at seven billion people on sustainable ways, holds, corresponds, and with them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who is this technology for the green revolution? Universities? Universities?
The government? Can you're forget!
It's going to be entrepreneurs now.
I read a very history in a futuristic magazine,
There was a group of experts that were included to city to city the future of New York in 1860.
In 1860, they came together and speculated what was happening in 100 years with the city, and the city was a sleep. The city: The city: The city: The city.
Why? They saw the curve, and they said, and said, if the population in this tempo further, they needed six million pounds of paths to stop the people who would be impossible to be able to finish with the millions of six millions of power.
Because they went to the master.
1860, they see the bad technology that life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001 cars in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of technology to find another technology, the running. There was little fabrics in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with companies.
As first, first of all, they're going to be created.
And they don't come and talk to you.
So next thing you have to do is absolutely engaged and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth is truthority.
From the smallest company, all of the smallest company, three things that need to sell the product of production, and it's got to be selling the markets and the financial and the financial and the financial.
Rata?
We never met a single person who can sell a little person who can sell you something that can sell the money can care about the money.
That's not existing.
This person was born.
We've looked at researchers and we looked at the world, and we looked at the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Yahoogle, Google, Google
There's only one thing that all successful companies have been successful companies, just one: No one: No one person.
Now we teach 16-year-old in Northumberland companies, and we begin to start to give them the first two sides of Richard Branson Autobiography. The task. The task. The first two side of the first two side of the first two robots.
Nobody's "wir" and 32 times "wir"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody reasons, a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we create a community where you have a small company that have a little bit of a little bars and bars and bars and bars. They're going to do for them. They're going to do for them.
What can you make it? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you get on the money?
"Oh, no, no, I can't you." "Well, you know that I think I'm going to figure out?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are going to support the companies that can help them to help them to help them to help people. We've found that the wonderful population of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be, I have to be five years ago.
The Penn State University, a Doccent in communication -- a demmunication -- to expective engineering in communications.
I had fear.
Rightfare. Fear. Fear of these students with their big brains and their books and their books and their books and their books and their books.
But as the conversation, he was developed to me as Alice when they looked down to the cannins, and a door, and a door, and a door.
I felt like I felt like I was conversation with the students, and I was just felt about the thought about the thought they had to discovered that they had to discovered that other wonderful.
I think to open up to open up to open up this door.
We need to have incredible communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the biggest problems, like for example, like, and health and health and health and health and health, and if we don't know what it's not going to believe that it's not a responsibility.
But these great conversation don't get to come to our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
So scientists and engineers, please, please.
I want to show you a few number of how to do it, how to see that we can see that the science and technology, and the technology, with their technology and talking to you.
The first question that you have to answer is, is, right?
Says us, why you're just so relevant for us.
Don't just say that their trabells are studying, but they're also saying that their trabells that their traditional structure in our bone, because it's important structure, because it's important to treat open up and understanding open.
And if you do that, what you do is doing, then you're doing after.
Afterwards are a hands to understanding your minds.
If you could use your doctors and pretty and pretty much, but why doesn't just say, "Raum and time, what's a lot of time, what's a lot of us?
Our thoughts to do is not understanding, is not the same as their nive.
As astein bits said, "Mach things like this, "Mach things like possible -- but not easier."
You can tell us something about your science of scientific scientific areas, without anything without compromise.
A few things are certainly, for examples: examples, stories and analogies. Atalogies.
And if you're presented, then the stories, then the stories.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's called "Stich Point."
What happens when someone else? Another one is going to be a little bit more seriously, and with these points.
A follows like this is not just long, but also slowly, but also too much on the language of our brains, and so we're faster.
This example of genes of genes of genes, and it's much more effective. It's much more effective structure of the trabele of the trade of the trade of the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration for the effective design of the effect of the effective design of the effective design of the
The trick here is to use a single simple sentence, just to use the audience, when it's audience, orientation can be orients, orientation can be used to relate our other senses, and graphics that can do with a deeply.
These are just a few number of public to open up and the door and the wonderful and the wonderful and technology and technology.
And the engineers I've been studied to me, I've been brought to make me."
And then, as you can see the science of your science and your multiple piece of relevance, so that's what's important, so that's important, and multiple, and multiple, and multiple, and it's incredible work.
So scientists and engineers and engineers, if you've solved me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handyridge, you can films in Syria.
With a handy, you can put a message and a protestaction in Egyptians.
And with a handy, you can take a song, you can take a sound of sounds and famously.
All of that is possible.
I'm a year in 1984 and living in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in these city.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people for change, and the streets and the streets and the street.
We're in 1989 and imagine that all of these people who had all these people who had to change the handy in the pockets, a handy in the pocket.
Who is a handy on the sales?
Have you high.
Have your hand phone, you high, you high!
Have you high. Aroid, a blackberry, wow.
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 35.830 cails.
Roheddata.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.Kommission of a direction.
This direction is called the direction of direction.
This direction is that every phone called every phone in Europe, every Internet, every Internetdia, every Internet in the entire Europe, a bandwidth.
Who is it going to be? Who is it? Who is a email?
Who did a text message?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All these information are going to be information for months to two years of your phoneths to two years of your phone or your phone.
And everywhere in Europe are people on Europe, and we don't want to say, "That's not going to want to be."
They said, we want to say, we don't want to do this idea.
We want to be self-making self-making age, and we don't want to be the phone and Internet and Internet and Internet and Internet.
There was a lawyer, Journalists, Priester who said, "That's not going to want to say, "That's not going to want to say, "That's not going to want to say, "That's not going to want to say, "That's not going to want to say, "That's not want to be.
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of blindness and said, "Freedom and said, "Freedom."
And some people say, that might be a stasium, that might be 2.0.
The state was the secrets in East.
And I asked myself, whether that really works.
Can you really all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone called the Germany, the Germany telecom that was the largest phone, and I asked her, and I asked them, and I asked them all information that I'd asked me told me.
And I asked her, and I asked her, and I asked them, and I got no right answer.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is my life protocolate.
So I decided to do a mountain, a message, because I wanted to have this information because I wanted to have this information.
But the Germany said, no, no, no, we're going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a compared to a compared to them.
I'm going to go back to where they send me to send me all the long information.
Because in the twish of the mouth of the edge of the E.U.U.U.R.
So I got this half of these half of the half of the CD.
And on the CD was this.
35th,830 columns.
First, I saw it, and I said, well, it's half a huge date.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months in this dialogue.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I start with this?
Because you see where I'm sleep where I'm sleeping.
But then I said, I want to go to the public and I want to go to the public.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show people what the people means is meaning.
So without time with open data City, I've data City.
This is a visualization of six months.
You can reincooms and outside, you can predict and back.
You can do any step that I do, you can do.
And you can see how I can see how I'm going to see how many elephone, and how many levels of a call.
All of that information is possible.
That's a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, it's just like, I called me, and she called me, and we talked to me, and we talked to each other.
And then I called me a few friends and they called apart.
And after a while you call it and you call it and we've got this huge communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they're going to go to apartment, when they go to bed.
You can see all this.
You can see the central figures, about who are the leaderships.
If you have access to these information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect development, as you can make a society, because you know who knows who knows who talked to who talk to who is possible when you're going to send to these information.
And these information are going to be information for months, in Europe, in Europe to 2 years.
As I started to start thinking that all of these people in the streets in the street in 1989 cell phone in 1989 cell phone in her pocket.
And the state of the state that was who had been in the demonstration of the demonstration, and if the state, who would have been the leaders, and then maybe that would never happen.
The case of the mountain might have found might not have found.
And also, even thought that the ice case of the ice.
Because today, because of course, and companies like so many information, like they want to get to get online and often, often, online and often of us.
They want to follow the opportunity to follow our lives, and they want to be long.
But even in the digital and a life in the digital time, and age.
But you have to fight for the self-making today.
They have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you say, you say that privacy is that privacy is a value of 21st century.
If you go home, you say, you're going to have your birth, just because companies and state the possibility, they don't have to specifically have to store it.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone society that they've talked about you have talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you remember your handy, you remember the self-making self-making the digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spiritual: Spiritual, fastaurants, broke.
So the city planer, and soon and talk about change the name South Central South Central south Central, and they changed it in South Los Angeles, which is something about what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spiritual flowers, fastrestaurants, broke broke.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food western South Central Los Angeles, the Drive-thrus and the drive-by and the drive-by.
The comic is that the drive-thrushed more people killing more people.
People die in South Central Los Angeles,
The fatty is fourths in my fourth is five times more than about 15 feet.
I couldn't do that withans.
And I asked me how to feel like you wouldn't have access to healthy food if you had no access to healthy if you've got out of the house, the negative effects that has been best effects.
I'm selling that roleton and sellings and sellings like buying.
I see dialysecentary seconds like Starbucks like Starbucks.
And I've got to stop that that this has to stop.
I caps the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no latest, I had no lustered 45 minutes to get a pestician rounded by pesticiously with pesticiously.
So I plant a food challenge, I food a food.
It's a piece that we call park.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is the thing that is the city.
But you have to fight it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to kep it in stand."
And I decided to kep it into standard.
So I came up and my group that L.A. Green ground, and we started together, and we started to plants, and own food, and own program, so that's all the program.
We're a kind of an advantage group, together from gardening all the social signs and all of these social stories, and it's completely freezing and all we're doing, and all we're doing.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone was a guy.
The city came up to me and he told me and he told me, and he said that I had told my garden, and said that I need to have to a richer.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A richeral remarkable approaches of food production of food land that's dead."
And I thought, "Cool. Her."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The L.A. Times winds, Wind Lopez Lopezzz, and talked to the city and talked to the city and talk to a member of generating. They were able to do a petition.
We thought you'd go to the hands.
My city strate, and he said that they're supporting it and said that they love.
So why would they're not going to do that?
L.A.A.A. in the United States, most broke.
They're six miles of broke.
These are 20 central Parks.
That's enough flower to plants to plants to plants.
Why would they find that?
and by the way, you get one plants, you get 1,000 sames.
With box boat in the value of a dollars, you get own own and green own.
It's my holds, I say, they should build their own food.
His own food is like to build your own money to pressure.
Look, I've got a connection in South Central.
I went took my sons. I went on there.
And I'm sort of this piece of the reality of the reality that was made by other people who were fabricians and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden is my graffiti. I plants. I plant.
And just like a graffiti coasts, the walls, the walls, I'm beautiful, I'm rases and Parkanlagen.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of pieces, and the trees are my dreams for these hydrogens.
They would be surprised what the Earth can use it as a country as a legs.
They can't imagine how amazing a sunlums is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I experienced how my garden to a instrument for the mind and the relationship, and the fourth.
To change the community to change the community of the ground of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wondering how children are going to be influenced.
Garden is the therapists, and careful act that you can do, especially with the city.
And you can get the extraction.
I remember this time when these mother, when these mother, and her daughters, it was about 10:30. They were in my garden, and I came out and I looked like this.
I felt really badly feeling, because they were there, and I said, "Wis you'd have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been watching people who were looking at people who were so close to do this, and that's just asked me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you don't have afraid, you don't feel your food."
And I said, "There, no, no, no fear that I don't think they're claim.
And that's what it's on the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take them back, but I want them to take them back to her healthy health."
At the other time, I went to a garden in this obdleton,
These are the guy who have helped me to decided to decided to deal with the laster.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how they've plants, and how they've plants and how they've plants and how they've been dead, and it was great for a moment.
Green reason for about 20 gardens, about 20 garden.
To our environments, and they came up with 50 people and they were all freedom and they're all volunteers.
If children carbon, food children carbon.
When they types, they eates.
But if they don't get anything about it when they don't get to be constantly, how food and body and body and body, they're blind, they're blind them.
I see young people who want to work, but they're working on this thing -- I see -- I see -- I see, I see in this thing that's exactly on the phone who's just going to be in the phone.
The gardens, I see as a opportunity where we can train them to care their communities to care their communities to get a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could do the next George Washington Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carvery.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Edboth, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole while, where people can share the same potentially share the same block.
I want to take slipscontainer and they turn them into healthy caf<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>saf<unk>scontainer.
So, don't understand me wrong.
I don't talk about cost-lock, because I don't get sustainable.
The comic neighborhood is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about it, people's working, and children of the streets, and they're going to get the streets and the honor and the honor and the honor, and when you build their own food markets.
So what I want to do is to do is to do is to do.
I want to say that we all ecological rebells, gangster, gangster, gangster.
We need to reach the picture of ganger.
If you don't have a gangster.
Are you going to go to 'n't you?
And let's make the weapons of your choice.
If you want to meet meet meet you don't want to make meet meeting in the caves and make a meeting and a meeting and a meeting, where you want to talk about it.
If you want to meet meet meet you want to sell you with your garden, so we can plants to plants.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster," means "No,"
Although, even though, a message of a better definition, and he said, "Ein Snollygoster is someone who is someone who is someone who is a message, independently independent, and their success, and his success, and his success, and their success, and his success, and his success
I don't know what "speakeral" is.
And I think that's kind of words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians know that they've got to control the language.
For example, for example, for example, the British Parliament, time, time, time, time, the same words.
And that was actually back to the mother was a man's own a man's extraordinary names Brass Crosby who was involved with the plament.
She was helped him in London and talked him a mutigrated him, but he was mutigrade, he was mutigrating, and he was so much in London, and he was so much in London, he was so much in London,
And just a few years later, we find the first neighborhood for the first motion of the first message.
Brassingly, the English word for bad for bad.
But that's not true. It's about a return to a press.
But to show you how words and politics and politics, I want to take you to take you to the United States, when they're just going to have the independence.
You saw the question of what you're going to be the state of Washington, the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leadership of a republic nation?
That's been in the Congress was debate.
And there was all kinds of possible for all sorts of predictions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernur Washington, and others, and others, and others, and others, and others, and others of America of America'shington.
Not so that's not a presence.
Some people wanted to call it King.
They thought that's been during the same thing.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king time spane.
It would have work.
But everyone was incredibly boring, because these debate 3 weeks, because these debate 3 weeks.
I've learned the days, I've learned the standard, "Immer's still the same issue.
The reason for the reason for the long time, and the long time was that the representation was the senat.
The representation didn't want to do whathington is doing it. They didn't want to do it.
Canighters, and they're going to bring him up to his neighborhood.
They wanted to give him the most farmers, you know, you know, you know, you know,
This title was "President."
President. They don't existed the title. He existed. But he's existed. But he's situation.
It's something like the bottom of a Jury.
He didn't have more size than the task of "Anclear<unk> or "Anpasser."
Sometimes, there was Presidential community and governments and governments, but it was really an incredible titled title.
That's why the senates.
They said, "That's smile, you can't call it President.
This classroom has to describe and out of the countries and out of countries.
Who is going to take it, if he's take a dumbing little title like President of the United States?
And also, for three weeks, the senates didn't go to the senat.
Instead, you know, the title of the title of the message of the message, but they didn't want to make the clearly, but they didn't want to be able to do with their own powerful respects and methods.
You can learn from three interesting things.
First, I think that's what I've been able to find out if I don't have the senatenates that had ever been for the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just waiting the title. He was just going to be actively.
Secondly, you can learn to say that if a government is something temporary -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- then you know, you know,
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title "President of the United States," isn't so clearly not so that you don't know anymore?
This has more than 5,000 nuclear pollinators that he's got to do with the largest people who had a photography of the world and a photte drone and a photte drone.
It's really a story and story.
And so the senat on the end of the end.
They have a respectable title title.
And the other sense of the sense of sense of property -- now it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the cling of the classrooms with the 5,000 nuclear pots, and so on.
So the end, the end of the senat and the representation is because no one has never been lost, because no one said that you're going to be a talking about the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take with, and with.
Politicians trying to use words to control the reality and the reality, but actually changing the reality, but actually changing the reality words, the reality ever change the reality ever change.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebels in a laster of campaign to Dianian surfer, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I thousands of my black converse half of a pair of country and carrying a rocketermany, and I couldn't even see the government I couldn't even see once I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
And I was a long time, I was bigger, I was biggest pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Partys and football players and windows and windows and fights and rassistic southern American demonstrationalistic demonstrationalistic demonstrationalistic demon
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to stand up here, embrahane, Southestate proletes, and atheist and atheist and atheist and atheist and atheist, and atheist, who had neine years in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do with art, but I could do art, but I don't like to make a rainforest, I want to make art, and I want to make the personality and cars.
I want to spend a day in life of a dihad -- Gangster who spend his dictionists like "Popstar Bling" as "Popstar Bling" and popstary black and political corruption and political corruption and political corruption.
And whatever, the Dihad-gangster, when you make a parliament and a choice and a choice, and I'm going to do with the slogan: I'm rich." I'm rich."
And trying to use these campafiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosio.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and I walked to the project called "Running" and created them as policement," and they're going to be a wrong control of cabularly on the streets and cars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistanistanistanistanistanistan conflict,
The war and the free-making a new environment, and the new environment, and models and models that you can only create a model of a model of soldiers and self-making collection for soldiers and self-making a fellowled by a fellow-makerfterm.
And I'd like to see how a simple simple simple cabulative monitor of Appells to create appelling a dialogue of the dialogue of the development, today, and they're going to be colonial relationships.
But for all of these things that you can get in prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be miscon.
But I do that because I have to do because I have to lost the geography of self-like it.
That's my last. What's your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I've been working as a model.
And then, just 10 years, right?
I feel that I've built up here in the room, because I had a tension, because I wouldn't have to stop that clothes.
Fortunately, I've got something to the way.
This is the first time that someone on the TED book on the TED books, so you can see, so I think you can see.
If you'd really case a few women, when I figured out what I need to say, I don't need to say that I'm later on Twitter.
I also think I'm pretty privileged, because I'm very shortly, because I can change in very shortly, which you're thinking about myself.
And that's not all the chance.
These device are very uncomfortable, it's good that I wanted to wear.
The hardest part is part of my head, the pullover about my head, because then you'll all be able to do with my head, so you're nothing about my head.
In order to order.
Why did I do that now?
That was personal.
Well, it was hopefully like this picture.
As an image is powerful, but an image is also operating.
I just have just changed your opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photographer, I told my back and I'm going to figure out my hair.
And then, from operations or the wrong breaks that I was wrong for two days ago, there's only very few days ago, there's only very few opportunities, and our extraordinary -- even though it's a big personality, and uncomfortable.
It's to be a middle for me to be honest.
And I'm stage on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm stage on this stage because I'm a hill, because I'm a woman, and in my broke, we call this sexy girls.
I'm going to ask the questions that people ask me to ask me to ask me to the real way.
The first question is, "How will you make a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means nothing means.
The real reason why I was a model, is a medical lottery and a message and maybe you're asking you, and maybe you're asking.
Well, in the last few centuries, we've healthy, well, and young and young, and we're defined, but we're biological programmed, but also as biologically programming, feminally, and highly, feminally definitely high.
This experience was created for me. And it's a creature that's a sense.
I know there are people in the audience that are people in this point, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Naomi, Tyra. Liu Wen."
And then I'm going to comments, I'm going to be involved.
But unfortunately, I have to share that in 2007, a very exciting Doctorand of NYU all the models on the walk.
The next question that will always asked me, "Can I'm going to grow up a model, if I'm a model?"
And then I said, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls really want to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be.
You can be presidentinal of the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a ninja-hander-handerminja-dom, because then you'd be the first time you'd be the first."
When they say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I want to say, "Who," then I want to say, "Who."
Because I don't have a responsibility and you couldn't be the carbon director of American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next small.
And you say that you want to say that you want to say that you'd like to say that you'd like to say that you want to win the lotto.
You can't confluence it, and it's not a career, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to give you 10 years,000 years, science knowledge, because the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart.
If there's a photograph, and you can see the light, and then you can see, and then you're going to be a photo, and then we want to go to the cameron, and then you go to the legs, and then you go to the legs, and then you go to the poor.
It looks like this.
Hopefully more comic than that.
That was ... I don't know what happens.
If you're going to start the school and a few jobs, and you can't be sorry, you can't be much more likely to say that you want to be a lot of the United States, but in life, "10 years," you're going to go to the United States," you're going to go to go to go to go to go to go
The next question that will often me, "Who's retuse every photos retuse?"
And yes, so pretty much every photos, but that's just a little part of the story.
That's all the first photo that I didn't do that, and that was also the first time I had a biciniode. I had a biciniode. I had not even my periode.
I know that's pretty personally, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me on the day, this shooting.
My friends, my friends.
This is me on a pyjama Party, a few days before a few days before a shooting for the French Vogue.
This is me with the football team and in V-Magazin.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's construction, and there's construction of profession, and Make-up cylists and Make-up artists and photographer and stylists and stylistent and struction.
Okay, when next thing is, people ask me, people ask me, "We're always asking me?"
Yes, I have too many 20-cm-cm-cm-cmany that I can never wear, but the things I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about, things I'm going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went took a day, and I went into a laden, and I had my money. And you gave me the clothes.
As a teenager, I went to my friends with a fear, and they were able to turn a red, and of course, and of course, and of course, and it took a powerful, and we could only get a mind, and we could farmers, and we could still get on.
I have this cost of my personal things, and I don't get to my personality and not because of my personality and there's people who are personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were filter and filters, and they were 85 percent black and latinos and latinos and latinos and latinoss.
It's only 17,000 young,000 young, men, men, men and latino, and latino, "Who do I asked, "Who I'm going to ask?"
It's like, "How often do I'm going to stop? When I'm going to stop?"
And when I found my right talk about this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these number 178 percent when they're 178 percent when they're 178 percent.
The last question is, "How is it to be a model to be a model?
And I think they expect them, they expect these answer, "If you're a little bit, and longer, and you feel very happy, you feel very happy and fabulous, you feel very happy and fabulous and fabulous and fabulously happy."
And Backstage, we're going to be answered this impression.
We say, "It's really greative so much to receive, and it's greative, inspired to work with creative people."
And it's true, but it's just the half of half of the story, because what we never say, "I never talked about the camera said, "I'm never feeling me, "I feeling me."
And I feel like I feel like I have to think about my exception.
And if I ask you ever ask, "What do If I was happy when I was happy and longer legs and longer possible harm?"
And then you should make a few mathematically because they have the thin, because they've got the most fastest legs and the coolest coolest coolest coolest, and they're the most of their exception.
When I didn't ready to read this talking about this talking to me, and I'm very difficult to picture, because one of them, I felt very uncomfortable to say, "I'm going to be here." And I got to say, "I'm going to be my gunting. And I was really felt like, and I was really felt like, and I
It was very difficult to do a very difficult, a result of crazy and race, and race, if I'm one of the biggest use of it.
But I'm also happy and feeling, and I'm going to be here, and I think it's great that I've been doing it here before I've been doing before, and I wouldn't believe, and I wouldn't believe, because I wouldn't be like, I wouldn't tell me how I wouldn't tell youn't tell
If you take a little bit of this talk, then we all have the power of imagination, we all have the power of implications and mistakes and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten my grandmother nobody who's come in the exility, "Son, list of life, "Son, levels.
But who never would never be like a Gaddafi-Revolutionary."
Now, it's almost two years, since the liby since the liby research, inspired by the waves of the waves of the waves in the end of the Egyptian revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, with many other libyers, and outside Libyens to corns to start a single day and to start a revolution to start a revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Boysche, libysche and men and men, in the first series, for the first set of the regimes, hold slogan of the freedom, waiting and social justice in the air.
They have an example, they've been using the brutal dictators by brutal dictatur Gaddafis.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the farming east, from the farms, until the south.
Finally, after after a time of six months and almost 50,000 deaths, and almost 50,000 tyrants and the guyrants and the guyrants.
But Gaddafi, but a big big big big big big broadcast, the tyrannei, and the reason for corruption and the reason for course.
And over four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannic regime, and the infrastructure, and the moral structure of the lybic society.
The consciousness and the challenges, I realized how many other women, I women to build the civil society lybia, and we've been able to build a civilization and never been related to democracy and neveral equality.
And so, in 200 organizations were during and unmed and unmediately, and in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in the exil, I came back to Lybia, and with a unique, and I started to the subjection, I started to the subjection, human development, human development and leaderships.
Women, with a women's green group of women, I women, I women, a movement of women, leaderships, leaderships, and it's public life, and it's public trials.
And I met the policies, I met up a very difficult environment, a environment that was always strong. A environment that was always authoritic politics of dominance and exclusion.
I just put a piece of peace and female powerful women to create a rather than a lawyer, and to reach a law that every citizens, and to choice the right hands and citizens and citizens and possible together and cover and possible to possib
At the end of our initiative and successful and successful.
Women women women's 17,5 percent of the National choice in the first choice.
But long as the euphories of euphories and the entire revolution, and the whole revolution to new neighborhoods of violence.
All right now, we wake up to the money to the money, original mosques and suffi-Gres.
In another morning, we got news about the morning about the message of American message and the attack.
And then, again, the morning of officiences of officiences.
And really, we're going to grow up under the military of military and their opportunities and their power and their power and their power and their power and laws and laws and laws.
Our society, founded by a revolutionary spirituation, polarized by the ideal and principles and principles and principles, social Giveness, social justice, social justice she had started in the beginning.
Intolerance, exclusion and rocks and rocks and rocks of the <unk>Following the revolution.
I'm not here today today today with the success story of our reversation, and the choice.
And I'm a lot of standing today, as a nation that we've met a nation that have metrate choice and the wrong decisions.
We've done our priorities.
Because the choice needs to have still stability or security or security or security.
Hat the remarkable listense and the way between female and men's female candidates and national failure.
No, she didn't.
What is it?
Why is going to continue our society and dominated by self-like politics of dominance and the exclusion of men and the exclusion of men?
Maybe the only women didn't have the only thing that has been female, but the female values of the middle of the middle of the including and the including.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensumer than they've been broke the choice, and the polarization, and the polarization and decision and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative requirement of the female of the female, quantitative requires.
We need to stop in the name of the name of the name and a day of the roach.
We need to start in the name of the compassion and the general and the gnade.
We need to develop a female discovered the female values that wouldn't just too, but also too, but also together, instead of collaboratt conclusion, instead of stattle, instead of stattle.
These are the ideal that's a completely certain lybia, to get peace to get peace to get peace.
Because the peace has a alchemic and in this alchemics, and it's about the feminal view of the feminal view.
That's the real remarkable reverse.
And we have to use existence, before we do it before we do it.
After a transportation of the Coran "Salam" -- Fried "storance."
The word "mheemic trust," which is known to all of these traditions, the same Arahamic tremendous type of the word "mbolized the word "mbolized the whole feminal feminal feminal feminality, and the whole mankind.
And just like the motherleible for the embryo, which is growing in him, completely, so nutrition of the compassion of the compassion of the middle of the world.
That's why we said, "My grandmade, all of these things."
That's why I said, "My grandpotential Groll."
We all have the gunting of all the gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, and I thought I was the best of the world, and I wanted to use the song.
And I was very proud.
In school, we found the story of Kim Il-shapan, but we don't learn much about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan and Japan our legs.
Although I was often asked me how the outside of my life, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea to a life to a change time.
And I saw years, I saw a public head of public he thought, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to live invited.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter of a warful of a collegin.
And you know, "If you're going to be here, we're going to be family members, because we've been eaten for two weeks.
We're going together on the ground and our body are soon as well as well as well."
I was so shocked.
I heard to hear the first time, people in my country.
I went to the bottom, and I went to the terrible, and I didn't even solve anymore.
A living woman layer on the ground, and a both child in their arm, and a bit of his arm, and it's mother.
But nobody helped them because all of them, because all of them were so concerned to care and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hungernot in North Korea.
At the end of north Korean, more than a million northern hunger, and many otherwise, and many otherwise, because they only reason, because they're reason, and tree.
In fact, incidents were always been highly, so that's all dots, except for me to the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the environment.
I always asked me why they had no lights and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the river of Amrocces, the part as a border between North Korea and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and Chin
As you can see, the riversity can be very simply and allowed to be able to see the flight.
But many survival.
Sometimes, I saw lighting on the river.
I can't say much about how I can say North Korea, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I can turned to China's changed the china.
I thought that I thought I was a short time of my family.
I never thought I'd never thought it's 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very hard to live without family without family.
I had no idea of how life as north Korean as north Korean flying. But soon as a northern I would be extremely hard to be very dangerous, but also very dangerous. Becorean Fly.
So I lived in the fear that my realization might identity, and you would be able to fly into a bad coverage, and you would go back to North Korea.
One day, my biggest alptraum when I was driven by the Chinese police, and in the Chinese police and in the police.
Somebody remember to be north Korean, so they test my Chinese chinese and asked me to ask me told me.
I had this fear, I thought I thought I was exploding.
Would anything else, I could be appear, I could be embraced and able to be embraced.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I felt it, but I felt it, I felt my feelings and answered the questions.
After they were finished with the experience said, "That was a magic.
It's not North Korean."
And they went to me. It was a wonder.
Some North Korean in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had girlfrigerator.
Although they were expected, they were finally free, they were free international pressure.
These north Korean, not so much lucky.
Every year, every year, in China, in China, and after North Korea, where they're followed, where they're going to be public, or public.
Although I had lucky, I had a lot of other north Koreaners don't know.
It's tragic that North Korean, and they're hard to fight and hard to survival.
And then, after they learned a new language and worked on a moment, can be founded in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the hidden, I decided to go to South Korea, and again, and again, I started a new life.
I was in South Korea never method, a bigger challenge, when I thought I thought it.
English was so important that I had to start learn to learn to learn to learn.
And I've got the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all coreans, but inside, we've been very completely expanding from 67 years of part of 67 years.
Identity a identity crisisis.
Is there's South or North Korean?
Where am I going to come from?
All of a sudden, there was no country that my home.
Although I was the adaption of the southern life didn't fellow, I had a plan.
I was already for the attention of the university.
And just as I was brought to my new life, I got a shocking proposed to a shock.
The North Korean Behind Korean box that I went through my family, and as a punishment, and as a punishment, and as a punishment, and as a piece of place on the country.
They had to fast as possible, so I started plane, so I started plan.
North Korean, an incredible stripes back to their way back to freedom.
It's almost impossible to over and South Korea and South Korea, Ironically took a plane, Ironically to China and I made me to the North Korean border.
Because my family language, I had to suffered them more than 2,000 miles, and then after Southeastasia.
The business is a week, and week, and we've been almost expecting more.
Once, when the bus once, a Chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the expects of all and started asking questions.
And I didn't understood a Chinese, I thought they'd being told me.
When the Chinese example, my family, I decided told him, and I decided to tell him that she would be.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, but happy.
We did it took it up to the laotic border, but I had to look for almost all my money to borders of Laos.
But even after we had the border, my family, my family, because Illegal borders, because illegal border.
After I had money to pay money, and switched my family, my family, but I was family. But I was repeated in the mainstades in the mainstadtle of Laos.
This was one of the biggest back of my life.
I had all done to do with my family to family, and we were so close to the family, but my family, but my family, just before the southern Both Both.
I went down and I went to the instruction and the police and the police, and I tried to family, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money or money or money or money or money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked myself the voice of a man, "What's losing?"
I was completely surprised that a friendly about it.
In broken English and with a words and with a words, I went to cooperate my situation, and without a bankomat, and numbers, and two other north Korean, and two other north Korean to get them out of prison.
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he said, "I'm going to help you.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The remarkable free-mbolized free-mbolized for me took a new hope that north Korean, and he showed me the friends and he showed me the friendness of free and the support of foreign pollution, because the northernational community as the Northernational community as
Finally, after our long journey, my family, and I was recorded to southern Corea, but the freedom.
Many north Koreaner, from their families and soon as soon as soon as they go to a new country, they start with little bit or not money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us to education and many more.
We can also change the bridge of his bridge between people in North Korea and the outside of us in contact with family, and we're going to send them information and money, and we're going to change the helps information.
I had a lucky, so much help and inspiration inspiration inspiration in my life, I hopeful North Koreanernanians with international success.
I'm sure you're going to be more successful north Korean, and I'm going to see on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a bit of a bit.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very well.
He can't talk about, but he's communicated focus on a way that it couldn't have some of the best speakers.
Remi, what love is love.
He shared it means to share and he's participate it.
It's not great. He's not right on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences and imagine if you just never mention: He never told a lying.
When he songs from our childhood, trying to remember words that I don't even remember, he remember, how little we know about the understanding of the understanding of the unknown.
Samuel is 16th. He's very well. He's very well.
He's a absolutely uncomfortable memory.
But he also has a sixed.
He can't remember if he had my chocolate war, but he remembers, but he remembers of public, and he was able to remember my iPod, as he was four, as four, as four, as the most public four, as the most public four, and in my arm.
Do you don't hear anything?
But many people don't agree.
And in fact, because their understanding of normal version of normal version of normal version often understood, they'll often understood.
But what I mean, and my heart and my soul, and my soul, even though that was the case, even though they didn't even though they were just a case that it was just autism, that they were just autistic and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary.
Well, for those of you who don't trust to use the confused on the terms of the brain is a complex faction of the brain that's a complex faction of the brain, and sometimes learning and sometimes learning.
It's extraordinary, in every individual, and it's Remi.
And worldwide is going to be all 20 minutes in a new person autism, and even though there's one of the fastest growing developments of the world, there's no knowledge or health or health or healing or health or health or health or health.
And I can't remember the first time I remember when I'm autism, but I can't remember it.
I was born three years old when my brother when my brother, and I was even born, and I was so excited to my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and actually, and actually, he didn't really interested in me.
Remi and regulated in his own world, with his own world, with his own rules, and he found found found found things like the smallest things in a smallest thing in a series of the space that's what it's going to eat and all of it.
And when he was older, he was different, and the differences were critical.
But down the wutances and the frustrating and the frustrative hyperactivity was something really innocently, and innocent nature, a boy, a boy that had never been a boy that had never been a human who had never been a human who had never been a human who had never been a human whole phone who
And also, extraordinary.
Well, I can't learned that there was some moments in my family, I had a moments in my family, I wish I wish I would be like me.
But I'm going to learn to the thought they've taught me to the things that Individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these things I don't want to figure out that I wouldn't want to thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of th
Normality about the beauty that beauty that we're going to give us, and the fact that we're different, that means that one of us is wrong.
It means that there's another kind of direction.
And if I only say one thing to Remi and to tell you, and to you, and then it wouldn't be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a genius. We have a genome of us. And in all of us. And in all ears, and in all early in the ultimate opened by potential.
The chance to size the chance and chance and change in the moment where we try to be trying to be different.
Please -- don't say that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has taught us with edggs and curiosity with this photo on a project to a project, and with a millionth of millions of just a millionth of millions of million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million times faster and see the world, but a million pictures a million pictures per seconds per second.
I'm going to ask you a new kind of photography, the femto-Femto-Femto-potography that they can make time to make a new tagging light in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can look at the abse of our views, or without a picture or without a <unk>-ray picture in our body, and really in our body and really in question, and really in question.
So if I take a laser potentially, and I'm going to take a billion seconds, and they're going to create a photones, I'm a photon, I'm a photon, and this photon, and this photon.
So if you take this projectil, this photon Photon Photon Photon Photones, how are going to be botones in the flap?
What's light in time?
So this whole eventually.
So, think about it, you think that all the event that actually needs less than a nanosecond customer, so light to return that light to return that strips -- but I'm going to see this video to the factor of the factor of the light.
No, Coca-Cola Coca-Cola coca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-Cola coca-ca-ca-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola
So, in this movie, so much, so let me show you what happens to you.
The pulse, our project, our projects, we sort of a photonpaket, and that starts to move, and that's start to move.
A part of the light, after the table, and you see these extraction of the waves.
Many of the photones of photones, the last last last, and exploding the rivers and exploding.
As you can see, there's air, which is air, which is in the flashing.
As afterwards, the waves on the table and white the table and white the reflexions of the reflexions of the bottlexions of the flash of the flash of the flash.
If you take a end of a project, and it's the same strong stripe, and the video, and the video, and you know how long, you know how long you have to see how long you have to see how long you have to see the movie?
Are you a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long film -- from a long time -- from a long project, normal project.
And how about something still looking at something like a picture of pictures?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like when you put a small in a teap.
I think it's like this, as if the nature would be a photo, the photo, the photo, but of course, but of course, of course, of course, of course.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the light, you're going to stay atomate, that's going to stay. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and the light and the light and the light and after some of the seconds.
So, in the future when these femto-camera in your camera in your camerahandy, it could be able to make it possible to make a supermarket and figure out if you're going to touch it without even touching them.
So how did my team on MIT this camera?
So when you know, when you know, if you know, if you're a photo with a briefly light, but we've got very little light, but we've got a billion times faster than your career than your care, so well, so well, so well, so well.
So we're doing this project, we send this project, this photon-Paket, and then we've got to record that, and then we've been able to combinate these gigabytes and we're recovering these female computerically to show you the female that I've got to show you.
And we can take all these rohates and doing things with this row things.
So, superman can fly fly.
Other hands can make us feel like this, but how would it be a new superherocows for a future surgery: to see edge?
The idea is that we're going to street a door.
It's going to go into the space, a part of it, part of it will reflect the door, and then we could reflect the door, and we could use these more simplifying these more simplifying the light.
And that's not Science fiction. We've built it.
Links our femto-Camera.
Here's a puppeared, and we'll let the light on the door.
After our drawings in the Nature communication, and it was published by nature.communication, and they've been able to do this animation.
We're going to take these lights, and they're going to take them on these walls, and they're going to be able to get in all directions, and then some of the photon, and then we're going to get the lights that will reach the light, and then the light, and then the door.
And because we have a camera that's so faster -- our femto-Camera has some skills.
It has a very good time, and it can look at the world in light, and it can look at the world.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what we don't know what we don't know what's heard.
Indeed, we can take a laser ones, we can take a rh-h-by-by-by-by-by-by, but if we look at the images of these images, and then we're going to try together and try together and try together and try together and try together and try together and
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit about the lab, we can use the practice, and we can use the cars, and we can use collisions, and we can see what's going to see, or we can see what's going to look for survival lights, or we can look for survival light,
But of course, and the blood and birth, of course, which is why that's why this is a way to scientists, now, now, now, now, now, now, because a new picture of scientists, because a new picture of medical processes.
So, as you know, like a scientist, even a scientists, and we can get a scientists, and we can do a art, and we can do a art, and I realized that all of these gigabytes that we can't just clear that we're not only known to do all the picture of the education, not just the education, and
But it's also happening here.
If you look at these waves under the rivers, you see that the waves of us, you can see that the waves of us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turned out that we've almost in light, because we've almost in light, we've seen this picture and incredibly watched this picture.
The remote that happen in the event in the world, in the world, in the world, in the camera in the camera in orders by space, so we can use the relationship with space and time we can correlate this connection of space and time.
So, whether we should be able to do the explore, or the creating of a new creative processes, and we've been able to do with our invention, and we all have to do with our invention, and we all have data and datails on our website and hope to our ways.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many opportunities, like our middle of our lives.
We don't meet any neighborhood, so that many ways, so many ways, but we're going to use the same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and share things like tasks and crosss, slightly.
The projects from my questions, how much mine asked my neighbors?
How can we suffering more things without us.
How can we share our memories and teaching the country and the country and the country?
And how can we share our hopes for empty homes, so that our communities, so that our needs and dreams and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea is going to be big embracted by the hundreds of years, hundreds of years, beds and trees and trees and trust to play with a city where there's always music.
I think any time, every time, any time, no one time, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings, but it's also the city of the world, but it's also the city of America.
If I'm going to be able to do this house, and I thought it can beautiful. And I thought I thought to do something that changed my life for the life.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, and she was suddenly and unexpected.
I thought about the death, and I felt a big thankfulness, and I took me to my life, and it took me to me to be in life.
But it's hard to me, this is hard to make these views every day.
It's easy to lose and lose to lose and together and to forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I wrote a side of the house of the house, and I wrote a slides, "Bevor I want to die.
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could expect, but I was the next day, but I was filled, and they're always wall.
I want to share some sentences that were written by people who wrote from the wall.
"Bevor I'd like to die, I want to be piratrician."
"Bevor I'd like to die, I want to stand up the International datums."
"Bevor I'd like to die for millions of people sing."
"Bevor I'd like to die, I want to plant a tree."
"Bevor I'd like to live, I want to live."
"Bevor I'd like to die, I want to keeeeep them."
"Bevor I'd like to be a cavallery cavallery."
"Bevor I'd like to be, I want to be myself."
This is after place that was remembered to a sense of place, and the hope of people, and the hope of people, and dreams, and during me to the wine and drive me as the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and to understand and to a new way.
It's about place, place for meaning and remembers and remember what we're most important, and we're grow up and change us and change us.
I've done this last year, and I've done after news of passionate people who wanted to build a walls, and I wanted to build a wall, and I built my countries, and now I've been built in the world, and now, and now, South Africa, South Africa.
We've shown to how much power our power public places have the opportunity to share our voices.
Two of the most valuable things we have time, and the relationships that we have time.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever looking at the right thing with the right view of the right thing with the right thing and think that life is that life is that life.
We're often going to talk about death to talk about death or even think about death or even thinking about it, but I realized that the idea that the process of the death is one of the death is one of the things that we're strong.
The thought about the death, the death is used to life.
Our common place, we're going to show us as individuals and as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities, and with more opportunities, and stories, and stories, they can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I decided to do with a mathematics. A particular problem for everyone who's a particular problem for every mathematics, is that we're like companies.
Nobody knows what we're actually doing.
And so I'm going to explain the trying to explain what I do.
And then one of the most human activities.
We're crazy, we're including ballett and soups and soups, like you're going to see how you're going to see how you're going to see.
For extraordinary a extraordinary ballet of capacity and abilities and abilities, and possible eventually have a genetic component.
Traures, destroy neurological destroyed by parkinson long-like skillson, and that makes them to be a ballettues who was a ballettued to be a ballettuis.
And over the years, you have a lot of progress in the mind.
But yet, there's a worldwide 6.3 million people who live in this disease, and they have to live with the unmarable symptoms like swimmor, tremor, and other more and more living.
We need to measure the projective message, and we can measure, and last few opportunity to know if we have a objective measure if we have answered that this question.
<unk>rouchers is that there's no biombson and other movements don't have biomarkers, so you can't just leadership. The best thing that's the best thing that's the biombs.
You have to do it in clinics. It's very expensive, and that means, and that means that means that never really doesn't have to do that.
But what if patients could do that patients could do this test?
That would be a designed tour in hospital tour in hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't be a teures hospersonal hospersonal.
It costs 300 percent, 300 percent, in neurological action.
So I want to share a unconventional methods that we're trying to get to try to do that, because we're all trying to get in a sense of my business, like my recognize.
So here you see a video of video of vibrate vibrate stimps.
This is what happens in the healthy when someone speaking speakers, we can look at us as a stimply as a stimply because we have to coordinate all these voice, because we have to coordinate the genes, and we all have to do that.
And as Ballet, it's enormously enormous.
Think about how long a child, like a child, until it's talking about it.
And by the louds, we can use the position of vibrate vibrate stimming. And as the morganisms of parkinson.
In the bottom of the support of instance, you can see an example of unregular voice.
We're always see the symptoms.
If you're going to be swake, seaw.
The language is actually going to be a level and goes down and that's an example, and that's an example.
These impacts that are minimum, sometimes, sometimes, but sometimes, sometimes, and presence of digital microphone, and presence, combined with new sources, and we can actually be very farming.
How can these tests with clinical message? Well, they're both both both of neurologists. The test.
and they're just sort of. The infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. And that's not going to be the voice.
So you can be able to be able to be.
They're very quickly, three times 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something extremely billig, you can use it into big scale.
This is amazing goals with this amazing now.
We can reduce logistic swimplicity for patients.
Patients don't have to leave the clinics in clinics.
We can see if objective data by half a half.
We can do a couple massive massive massive studies and first studies and first, and first of all the population of the entire population of realization.
We have the opportunity to look for Biomarkers for biomarkers for the disease before it's before it's past.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we start today.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of voices to voices to voices to benefits of these goals for the first time.
We have space-drivated space, the drives of a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, without parkinson, you can go to a parkinson, to make a few center for a few center. I'll give you a few center of our goal. I've already in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people, you can say 10,000 people say, who says who isn't you?
What are you going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patient is that the patient is to give to person on person on person on person on parkinson't. OK.
Some people don't get to the end of the end.
But we collect a huge database, underesting, underesting, which is interesting. These environment, because we're important because we're important to make these expects that are actually capable of parkers for parkers for parkers for parkers.
At the time, you know, 86 percent genecially?
It's much better.
My students, I have to love him, because he's so fantastic worked so fantastic worked on the mobile physics, that it's also working on the mobile physically working on what this project, and we're in 9 percent.
I call this a connection.
That means that people can do -- people can take people with the handy and people can take the test. Parkinson's might be able to take their voice, so that their doctor, so that you can take their doctor of the disease.
That's what we're doing.
Thank you. Max Light, my dams and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenyairobi in Kenyairobi national parks.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the cows is the National Park.
The Nairobi national park is just in the southern park is just imagined. That means that wildlife is that wildlife as a park.
The spaceboards, the solutions, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that was killed. I wake up. I wake up and I found it. It was horrible. It was our only box. It was our only box.
My stamm that the stamm of the massai, believe that we came together with our animals and the way together with our animals.
I learned to hate solutions.
Our warrior warriorans. They're protect our collective stamm and our hearts. They're also brought to be careful because of this problem.
and kill the solutions.
Here's one of six solutions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's something about it in the National Park only so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so fe
In my stamm is a boy between six and nine years, and nine years, and nine years.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Feuer. Lions. Lions for me.
But then I realized that us would help us to help us see the solution, but the solutions that helps us see better.
But I didn't go. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to a bird.
I wanted to think the solutions, I thought I was next to the cow.
But solutions are very clues.
They come up, the birds and go back. At the next time, but they go back and say, yes, and they say, yes, yes, that's still not, that's still there.
And they're going to kill our fields.
One night, I wake up the case. I loved the cell phone around the hand, and that's not great.
So for me, for light, which is moving.
I had an idea.
And I was working as little boy, I worked all day in my room and took the new room and took my room and took my mother. And I took me to my mother. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took age-car-moth-motorcy and a direction of a motorcycle. The right or left. He wants to left. He just wants to left.
And I was a broke a switch to switch the lights.
This is a little birn of a caps from a caps.
And then I built all of this.
The solar panels the battery that battery, the battery, the battery. I call it a transformator.
And the directionaneous blind.
You see that the births are outside, because of the solutions.
And so this is what it looks like the solutions when they come to the solve.
The lights and the blink and the solutions that I was about the stall. And I was about the stall.
Thank you.
I've been installed installed and since we had no problems.
And then we heard our neighborhood.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and asked me if I asked her lights, and she asked her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed installed. They can see the solution.
And I've been doing seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good.
My idea is now used today in all the cenycle, even for other runs or leopards or leopards or leopards, elephants, elephants.
My invention, I'm going to be a stipal schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really excited.
My new schools, and I helped and helps and helps and helps and attention.
I even brought my friends with my friends and common slightly, we're going to use the lights where there's no people, and I'm going to use them.
A year ago, I just a boy from the Savanne, who was hoping his father. I saw airplane, and I'm going to sitting in a sitting in a sitting in a sitting!"
And here I'm going to stand up here.
I thought with a plane, I walked for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm a big, I want to be airplane. That's my great dream.
From the early, I can go through my invention, but by my father, I can save the cows of my father and the solution, and we can live without side, without the side, without strip.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language means that: Thank you very much.
You don't know how yourself, how to hear a story like your story like your story.
So you've got this stuff. Yes. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next to the list?
So my next invention, now I'm working on a electrical funny electrical funny?
Yes, I know, electric cities are already long, but I want to have my own.
You've already trying to kep, not trying to give you away, but I've been trying to give the trying to give you a sleep.
All the beginning is hard Turere, you're a little bit more special.
We're going to be after you're going to help my friend.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And I'm old enough to hold a camera in the hand, photography, but today, I want to share with you today, I want to share with you, and no one of them.
There was no way to make a piece of director, no chance, no chance, no chance. Not even the picture. Not even minute.
In fact, mostly, mostly, mostly, mostly, mostly,
My story begins when I was a talk about a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife that I made my first birthday on my arm. We were on my arm. We were on my arm.
And so we've been able to go back into New York and so we decided to shoot the same picture.
Well, you can see what you can see.
When the thirday birthday, my daughter said, "Hey, why, why don't you sabina, why don't you get a father-down, and it makes a father-down to the ritual form?"
And then we started to start to make a please tourists, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal, if you're including a completely free.
Nobody has never said, no one is that no one has never been lucky with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rice would change our lives.
This journey is very holy.
This is only after the 11th after the 11th, and I had to explain what happened on the day, and I had to understand what happened on the day.
These images are much more than just one moment, or a moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a way to do a week for a week, and as weeks and how we're going to change our time and how we're not just physically physically, but in all.
Because even though we're always doing our perspective of Mal. While they're always changing new miles. While they see the life with their eyes, and how they see the life with all around them.
These very intensive time that we spend together with each year, and every year we're expecting every year.
Last, as one of our rice, we went to our rice, and we'd place, and suddenly as a sudden, she's suddenly walking on a puppets, and they love to a pupples, where they love to a little kid,
And she told me about her feelings that she had five-year-old on the same thing that she had fought in the same thing.
She said that she remembers like her heart from the breast, when they saw the laden, when they saw the first time she saw the first time.
And now they looked in New York after high schools because they want to study in New York.
And I was clearly clear: The most important thing we all created, memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of the idea of active role in the most impactive role in the memory of memory.
I don't know how it looks like it, but I'm going to look like this 15 pictures, I'm on a families.
I'm always the image.
I want to start today everyone today with you today within the image and asking you to ask you to ask a picture of us?"
Thank you.
