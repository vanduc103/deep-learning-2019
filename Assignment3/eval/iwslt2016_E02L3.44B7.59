When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the closer of the clicker fire.
My father, hearing on his little bit, women, the night rich of the bBC.
He looked very happy, what was happying to do is unfortable, because it was incredibly, most of them, most of them.
He research: "Taliban are,"
I didn't know what that means, but it's really doing my father, but it's very important.
"You can go on a right, you can go back to a bad," he said," he said,
The morning I'm going to take away.
All right, right?
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistanistanistan, and I was six, and it was to go back to school.
And so I five years ago, I five years long as a junch of years, and start starts, and I started to go more, not more common slightly,
And so we could go back to school.
Every day, we've never seen a different way, so that could never might be able to do.
We're going to look at our books in Einking, so we'd like this, as well, as well,
Our story, we've been in a house, about 100 million winters in a little winter.
And the winter was after, but in the summer, but it's unfortunately.
We all know that we all know that we're allowed our lives: L teachers and our else.
In the most important, the difference for a week for a week of a weeks because the talible for a week.
We were never using how much they were talking about us.
Do they're going to do?
When they know where we're going to do where do we do?
We had angest, but we wanted to go back to school.
I had great great greater in a family in a family as important than important than the biggest and turned out.
My grandfather was farther.
At the eyes of a development provinced provinced Afghanistan. He's my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and I was fathered by his father.
My filmed mother, but line, but line.
That's them.
Two years ago, they went into the rows, only about our house for money for might and women and women and women.
And my father -- to see -- the first family in his family, who's a shock.
For him, it was clear that his children would be a children would be a children, but also tropss, tropsss, tropsss, tropss.
He looked as a lot of biggest risk, he didn't go back to school.
I know that I know that I'm going to go into the taliban, sometimes, even though of our lives, from our lives, and the perspective,
I'd like today, I had told me. But my father said, "Thatter, I hear it can be listening to listen to life.
No Geld can be foot. You can be in the couple of your house.
But a thing is going to be done, and that's always what we're going to believe if we're going to do with our bubble for your bubble, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country on a country, and I could be country,
Wither than 6 percent of my alterestion, I have a high-cluss than the second babies, and if my family, and if my family for my family for my women, I'd have a women.
Instead of states I'm going today, as a state of the Middleburby College.
When I was after Afghanistanistan, my grandfather, who was family because he was family because he was family, because it's been turned to me to a biggular.
He's not just just with my high school, but also the first time, but also the first question that I was the first question, and I'm going to five it.
My family family.
I've been great trees, but my family has stilled for me.
So I'm why I'm global bothers for 1010, a women for 10, a women for the both of women.
So I've been talking about the bigger, SOLALA, and maybe a few maybe for Matternethanistanistan, a country, a country, in the country,
It's wonderful to see how the ships of my shock with my shock with my big early chance.
And to see how their parents and value for them, and they also understand my parents, and I'm going to be able to change the wider.
So how Ahmed. That's not really being a name and I can't show you, but I can't show you a father.
And then, I've been a months, and he's been on the home of SLALALASA and they're going through a bombs and they're just just to get a bominutes.
When he was to home, he came out of the telephone and a stimp of him, he went to his taking him, he would try to be farming it.
And then he said, "There's now when you want to go to the future, but I'm not going to be able to play my daughter and older and older."
What's afteristanistanists, so I've been doing something that's going to be able to be able to be the most experience, most of us, the most explained the water, and it's the water, and it's also the first time you're also the first.
It's not today that our mouths are not important in our experience.
And they're going to be high-year-olds that are possible for a lot of a lot of future of their distributeds in a society of the society of the economic in the universe of the universe.
Our the taliban course, only hundreds of might be a hundreds -- because it was illegal.
Today, everybody in Afghanistanistanistanists,
Afghanistanistanists, from America from America.
The American, the American being solutions are solutions.
I'm notice that the change of daught that are not from the U.S.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistanistanistanists in my shock in my parents, and their parents, and their parents that they're going to make a lot of surface, I'm going to left a lot of wall and a lot of wall.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope and the hope and the unfortunity, and it's possibility to me, and it's the best slight.
And I think they've been great trees.
Thank you very much.
All right what I do is, also, I've been founded by my life -- I was founded by years ago, when you know,
In 1971, I've been looking at 1977, but it's not -- but I've been in Sambia, Cenbia, along the early, along Africa and Somania, and Sometal African countries.
I've been working for a nRO, and every single project, and every project that we're going to start.
I was finally,
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're going to do good work in Africa, and people are live in Africa.
Instead of all, we're all doing all of what we did.
Our first project, what I'm going to show what my first book, "Ripped inspiring," inspiring, after the same thing that we wanted to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you.
We came with its own satelling south in South Adambia, in this cambia, which is the Sambi, which is a sambi-Fi-clime, and the animal revolution and the animal and terrible.
And of course, the answer is not author, so we don't have a interesting for the work for the work for the work, and you're doing it.
We were absolutely that it was in a society of talue country.
But attention, why they didn't do it, they said, "God, we're just saying, "God!"
"Gode, I'm talking about people to remote the people to relationship."
Of course, everything in Africa.
We had this practice tomes. In Itales, in Sambia, so bigger.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Sambook, like Landwin is like Landwin's like Landwin."
When the tomates and reded, and reded about 200 nights about 200 nights and flying out of the flow and fraging everything.
We said, "Oh, we said, "Oh God, the nilt,"
And they said, "Yes, we've got no landscape."
"Why do you do this?" "I don't say, "I'm never saying, "I'm going to take us."
I thought, we thought, we were so bad in Africa, but then I saw what I did, but then I do, what's doing what's doing, what I did do is doing, what I did, I was doing it.
We felt like the nest of the nest of the nest.
They should see the unfortunately -- you should see the university of African people have certainly remembers.
They should be the book of Dead Aba," by Damba Moyoy Life, and it's a sambic economic scientists.
The book was 2009,
We've change the African contan contan contan countries in the last 50 years ago.
I'm going to tell you what this gone is that this gone.
Let's just simple.
Let me from a African, what we've been story.
We're important people are illnorists, colonialists, mission and there's two arguments, we're just patrianism or patrianism.
And the words of the longest watching "Thatic Water," what's called "Thead."
But they have two different possible business.
Patriarchal: I'm going to be a different cultural culture, as if they love my children.
Patronison: I'm going to be a other cultural culture, when they were my distribute.
And so why people are going to be able to be in Africa, Cheada, Cheada.
I was wondered, when I was the book, "Small," and I said, "Shumer," he said, he said, all over the economics, if they don't want to left the room.
This is the first principe the first practice.
The first practice is Ripe is Respected.
Today, the morning of the heart of the city of the city, a stables, and asked, "Can you're going to be a stability, not the news of the new city?"
When I was 27 years old, I was just remember, and I've never reaction, and he's never heard to take a system that's going to take a little bit of a motively, but you're going to be a personalistically, you know, you know, the personal personal personalisticularians who are the dist
What you do -- you're going to do it.
You're never memory with idea with ideas with ideas with the idea with the same thing.
We don't work from books.
We're doing in Cafs. We're doing us in capture.
We don't have infrastructure.
We fly fly free friends and find what the person who want to find what person.
The most important is the most important.
You can someone can be a idea of idea.
If you don't do this person?
The person for the own water for the most important thing.
The person for the own watch for the most important thing.
We help them to find that knowledge, because it can never be allowed to be allowed.
The person with the idea hasn't know that knowledge, but it's not felt.
A lot of years ago, I had this one of the warch, why do you're going to say what they should do, and what they do is to do with them? But why do we do it? But nothing in Gememember.
Let me tell you a brain.
There's a problem with community.
And the brain, no one of the public and they're going to say what they're going to tell their money, what they want to see what they're seeing.
Planation has this blindow.
The most people who are costs of the community, because they don't never doing it because they never meters.
We worked to do this, to do this to do this, to do this is a social infrastructure, not existed.
A new boxes, you have to be created.
This is the house of the companies of the house of the house of the best of the house of your center and the center and the center and center, and you can find the future of your life, and you can find a way to find the way to find the way to find affect.
I've been in it in itside, Westralia,
I've been promoved to the time and trying to get the time, where we should say what we should do, what they do is to do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had been able to help used to help me to help me, I've him. I was him. I was him. I was him in a garmai, I was him. I was him to help them to help them to help themselves and heart.
I'm going to work for fish, and I'm going to work and this wonderful, and that's not a fish for 60 percent of the American carbon, but for 150 percent of Japane for 15 percent of the biox.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "What do you do this?
How do you do. I said, "I'm doing something very swwwward.
I half the mundreds and him."
So -- -- -- so, the government: "Maughter."
We've been doing it in 300 memory.
We have 40,000 companies are going to go to the basically.
There's a new generation of university, the university of university.
Peter pressure, one of the best difference, a story of story, story with 966 years ago.
Peter pressure was Philosophy, pilosophy, and he's business. Petermany said, Petermany said, "It's indeportable indeportable and the society."
Planation is the todes of the universe of the United States.
So you're carching carry without know what the cost of human costs of human costs with their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get this.
You have to help them to help them and practive, and Privity to help them to help them, and they're going to help them, and they're going to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 course, we get 200 course.
Can you're going to be a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the people?
For exactly, you have the most practice, most of the mostly, right?
<unk>ual, economics. The eating people.
I want to say that the company is that we're going to be the right way.
We're the end of the first industry -- normal revolution -- normal bridge bridge, fossible, and there's not after system, and there's not after.
The consumer powerful is not after.
The Freton-tronomy is not after.
We have to look at how we have to do it, we have to live in the ways to behavior, and we can start to start with them, and with them, and with them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will be the technology for the large revolution?
The government?
It's going to be afford. And they're going to do it.
I learned a story in a future of a future of years ago.
There was a group of eperties that were able to future out the future of New York New York New York City in the 180s.
In 180, they came up and speculated what's going together in 100 years ago, and the stady next to the stady, the stady is a next time, the next New York, and it wouldn't exist.
Why? You look at the curve and saying, if the curve, when the population in this tempoints, they need to be able to be able to farmers, and they need to be able to be able to fight with the million people.
Because they went out in the mististakes.
One of 180, they see the most important technology that's looking at the new York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, 1900, there were 1001, 1001, 1001, 1001.
The idea that I had a different technology, the running, it was a little bit of little bit of little faby.
And so, Michigan. Henry. Henry.
There's a brain, there's a brain with companies.
When he had to tell them, you have to be a distributed.
One of them, they don't talking about you.
As next to them, you have to tell them, engaged and living invice.
And then you have to tell them the absolutely about the universe.
For the smaller to the biggest firmail, all of the largest, three things: that's got to be able to be able to be able to be the production of his finances and the financial and its to behavior.
Ratates?
We never never have a few personal person who are produce something produce something produce the same thing and to create the money.
That's something exists.
This person was never been turned out.
We have finished free and we've been able to 100 iconic firms -- Carnegy, Westing, Edison, Edison, Edison, Edledge, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Joogle.
There's just a saught that allowed all the world, only one of the world, only one: it's just a person who was just a person.
Now, we're going to 16-year-old in North American, and we started the most important in the most important of the first two side of Richardships, and the first side of the first time. The first time, and the first two-year-olds.
Nobody's "O2 malue,"
He wasn't alone.
Nobody's a firmairms. Nobody. Nobody.
So we can tell a community, in the memory, who have a little bit of the minter, and Bars, and Bars, and Bars and Bars, and you're going to do that you're going to do this, what you're going to talking about this.
What can you do it? Can you do it?
Okay, you can do it? Could you do it? Could you do this?"
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Mo you know that I'm not going to finish?"
We're activity to community.
We've got the groups of free, the companies that can use the companies, and they've learning them to help them and people have to help them. We have to help the wonderful intelligence of the intelligence of the economic economic economic economic economic econ
Thank you.
Five years ago, I five years ago, how it must be age, alice in the wonderful.
The pennennity is batching me -- a data -- a domination -- -- -- -- including in the universe in currently in Communication.
I had angest --
It's right now. Anggthers. Angels with their big great big big big big big big big big big big bigger.
But as the face of the face, he's developed me as age, as they're going to go back to a new world, and a new world, and a new world.
I felt felt like I felt as I felt like so I was felting with the students. I was talking about the media, and they wanted to do that they wanted to do this words.
I think that's what to do is to do this taking, it's great carmunication.
We need to change the big created carmunications of our science and in our world, to change the world.
Because our scientists and instants are the bigger problems that our bigger problems, like to example, and increasing, and if we don't know about it, and then we don't know about it. I think it's not going to believe it. I love in our numbers.
But these great social large, if our scientists, if our scientists and in their scientists, not in their wonderful.
So scientists and instants, bitch, clearly,
I want to show you a few an evidence, how it could see that we can see that we can see that the science and technology with their technology, and the technology, and he's talking about it.
The first question that you have to tell us, you have to have to be, and?
Sages us, why was a lot of science, society is so much more elevant for us.
Sages don't just suggests that their trees, but also saying that their traps us to trees that their drawings in our cooks, because they're going to understand it's important to understand it's important to understand it.
And if you do that what you do is doing, then you do, then you do,
Forwards are a hands are a hands of medical general Gought.
Some might be able to be able to be certainly, but why don't say, but why don't just a lot of time, and what's a lot of us?
Our memory, it's not to do is not the same thing like their night.
How do you're going to say, "Maughters the things like -- but not just like -- but not just like, but not just like,
You can tell us something about something about economic science, without scientific carbon, without anything.
A few things are going to be able to use, example: Because stories and analogies, and analogies.
And if you're working on their work, then you're going to go to the stories.
Habt her each other, why does it's "St" was "St"
What if you're going to be someone? Are young? Are young, and with these punchings, and they're going to be audience.
A lot of folks like this is not just a long time, but also too much more and also remaining part of our brains and though we're going to talk about our brain.
This example of Genevolved by Greaterview is much much we're a lot of public structure that the special structure of the terrible for the inspiration of the inspiration of the inspiration of the effective.
The Trick here is a simple, simple simple satelling satelling the place that public, if it can be audience, or even if it can be capture, and also the other sunkills and also the other sunch of the other sunch of the other sunch of the other sunch of the distrible.
These are just a few an effects that can help us to see these turns out and the wonderful and the science and the science and technology and technology.
And then the instants that I've been talking about me, I've been talking about the <unk>NA," in meeting countries, I want together with a same thing.
So, in fact, science, economics and economics, and eventually, so that's the revances, so that's important, and what's important to the same thing that's important to do with their work, and it's uncredible.
So scientists and instants, if you're going to be able to be able to be increase.
Thank you very much.
Hi. That's my hand.
A cellyone can change a life and a personal free free-down.
So you can see a cell phone can be a personality in Syria.
And then you can see a cell phone can actually turn a protestion and a protestion in <unk>gype.
And with a handy can take a longer, it's high-Coud and books and books.
All that's the celly.
I'm a year, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back into this city.
And then you can see how hundreds of people, for change for human beings of people who are going to change the streets and the street.
We're in 1989, and we're going to change that people who are all these people who have change in the cell phone in the tasks.
Who in the Saal has a hand?
Half you high.
Half you highes high half, half!
Half you high. One, a black, a blackerry.
These are many. Fast everybody has a hand.
But I want to talk about my hand and my hand and my hand and my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 350-30 colleages.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the Eurommission is a river.
This research is called Right Rights today.
This running that every particular telephone in European European European in European, a bandard, a bandard, a bander of bandards of the bander of the carbon.
Who do you know, right? Who do you get a piece?
Who set up a small?
And if you're a handy, where you're going to do.
All of these information are going to be able to two years ago, months of your months or your Internet or your Internet or your Internet.
And over Europe, people are the people who are the people who said, "That's not want to do."
They said, we said, we wanted to do this idea.
We want to selful self-making in the digital time and we wanted to do that the telephone and internet and information about all these information, all of us to talk about us.
There was applices, Journalists, Pres, Perists, "That's not want to say, "That's not want to do."
And here can see how to see how to see people on the streets of breaking from Berlines and said, "Free."
And you say, you know, this could be back to the state 20.
The stasically was the brain in Ostruction in Ostruction.
And I asked me, if I think that's really working.
Can you can do all these information about us?
Every time I'm going to use my hand?
So I asked my telephone, the distribute telephant telecomy who was the biggest telephant telephants in Dep, and I was founded to me, and I found allowed me told me, and I'm going to talk about it.
And I asked them, and they fraged them and fraged them, and they don't get a right now.
But then I said, I want to say this information because it's my life is my life, because it's protoce.
So I decided to do this, I've been able to food a memory because I wanted to have this information.
But the distrutomic telecom, no, we're going to be distributed this information.
At the end of a came to a came with them.
I'm going to go back to the ancients where they all allowed me to me.
Because in the course of the bundreds of the basically, the emotion of the emotion.
So I'm going to be half of these half environments with a CD.
And on the CD was:
350-30 ceils.
First, I looked and said, I said, it's half, it's half. My.
But then I started a way, I think, this is my life.
These are sex months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit of what I should I do with what I should I do?
Because you see where I'm going to think about what I'm going to do.
But then I said, I want to go with this information, I want to go to the publicity.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show you what people shows what people do is means.
So with time with open and open Data City City, so I've been here.
This is a visualization of sexualization of my life.
You can recently record and recording, you can go back and go back and go back and go back.
You can do every single, because I do, I do do do it.
And you can see how I can see how I can see from Franks with the circularly five years, and how many five years ago.
All that's possible information.
That's a little bit of angest.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
First, it's just so I'm just wife and she goes back to me, and we're going to go a few mold.
And then I called a few friends and they running a few couple.
And after a way, and you're going to go and you've got this right, and we have this right now.
But you can see how people can see people with communicate, to be a little time, they're going to go a book.
You can see it.
You can recognize the central figure, about the figure of the groups are the group.
If you can see the information has to see what you can see what't see.
If you can relationships, you can do the society of society.
This is a book for Langer for Lountries and Irana and Iran.
This is the perfect effects, like you can see a society, because you can know, because you know, because you know, who's a little bit of the email, if you can do that, you know, if you've got to do this information.
And these information are going to be able to be seen months, in Europe, in Europe.
As I said, I said, we're going to tell us that all of these people in the streets in 198989898,
And the state state, who had been won't have been able to be done, and if the strange, and if the state, you're going to have been going to be able to be able to be able to happened.
The case of the baller might belief might not states.
And also, you don't think of the case of the case.
Because it's states and firms and firms of information, how many information, like they can do about us, and infline.
They want to change the possibility of our lives, and they want to learning all the time.
But even self-bime and a life in the life in the life are not a wider.
But everyone need today for the same thing today.
They have to do it, every day.
So if you go back home, you say, you say that Privity is that Privativity of 21st century, and that's not the old century.
If you go back home, you say, you're going to say, because it's just because it's possibility, and start to species, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think you're going to believe your telephants, you've seen the information, they've seen the information.
So, in the future, every time you have to use your hand, if you're going to use yourself, you're going to remember the same time you have to remember the same time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central Central.
This is South Central: Liritual, snowerful, breaking breaking breaking.

We've got to go into the hanges.
My strattletratching, and he said that they're going to do what we do.
So, why they shouldn't do that?
LA. LA. It's in the United States the most best states in the city.
They're best 62 covered 62.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough to fly 75 million tomes to patatatatates.
Why do you shouldn't find the teaching?
And so you can see the an evention of a plant,000 sames.
Middle Bohoh in the window of a dollaring and green the windows in the windows of 75 dollars.
It's my harboth, I say that they should believe that they should believe it.
No subjects is like it's like it's like your own gone.
You see, I've got a power in South Central Central Central.
I've been going to be there. I've been talking about my sun.
And I know, part of this part of this part of this removered remained by other people who was fability and I fability my own relike my own relike.
You see, I'm a counter.
Graward is my graffiti. I'm public.
Let's like a graffiti-counter, the walls, I change the wrong and Parks and Park.
I'm going to use the garden, like a couple of stopping and the plants are my cities are my cities.
They're going to be surprised what you can use when you can use it as a land.
You can't imagine how he's a sunningle sune, and how people are booking people.
So what happened?
I've got to a garden, like my Garden for the instrument and the result of my fourth.
And to change the community to change the collection of the collection of the cover.
We're the box.
They would be wonderful, like children.
Goday is the theraperapy and certainly, because you can do it, because you can do with the best.
At the earthy, you're going to be careful.
I remember this mother, when this mother, and their turned up, it was came up to 1030: 1030, and I was able took my garden, and I came up and I went back to my guy.
I'm going to tell me, because they were felt because they were there, and I said, "What's not doing it.
The Gargest is not without the street."
I've been looking at me, if I looked at me, and I've been doing me, and I've been doing me, and I'm just saying, "Finess people, I said, "Fin't say, "Fin't get you're going to be food."
And I said, "Thy, no, no, no one, I don't know what they're not what they're going to do.
And so it's what it's going on the street.
That's the idea.
I want to take it, but I want to take it, but I want to take her health."
At one of other time I live in this obviously in this objects in Dow Christribution.
These are the types that are going to decide the laster.
It was cool and they were teaching their stories, how it has been able to see how they've got to see them with her mother and her mother, and it was funning it was to seeing it, and it was just a moment, if it's just a moment.
Green reason, it's been able to be certained about 20 Garman.
To our environments came out of our environment and doing all the free and doing all free free-will.
If you're carbon, it's children.
If they turned it, they tomes, they tomates.
But if they don't get it on it, if they don't getting, they don't get the body and careful and careful, it's always whatever you're going to do.
I'm going to work, people who work working, but they want to work in this ding in this ding -- I look at the pads, and I'm going to go on the planet, and they're going to go back and they're going to go back.
The Garmers I see a violence, where we can children, where we can children, to create their community to five life.
And if we do that, who know, who know?
We could take the next might be the next conversation of Carverton Carvernment.
But if we're not going together the experience, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my public. That's what I want to do.
I want to be a whole wocking a lot of parents, where people can do the same prediction of the same bock.
I want to take slowerful and they're going to take caful caful.
So, you don't understand me.
I don't talk about cost of costs, because it's not after.
The community is that you have to be ability to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ability to be ability to be able to be ability to be ability to behavior.
I'm talking about it, people to work with the streets and children, and they're going to help the create and the create and the create and the eating, if you're going to learning, and if you're going to learning.
So what I want to do is that's the syxy to do.
I want to say that we all all of the same popular relationships, Ganger.
We need to reduce the bang of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger, you're not a ganger.
Gangerous, you're going to get a slight?
And let's the waiterally choice.
If you want to do with me, you want to do with me, if you don't want to do it inquality and a meting and a meting, where you want to talk about it, where you want to talk about it.
If you want to do me to get me to your shock with your bars, in my garden, so we can use anywhere.
From. Thank you.
Thank you.
A singlebling my lower in the later in English English World Wargygraphy,
Because it's so beautiful.
And "sygoster" means "coster" "moster politics.
One of the 19th century in 19th century, a better definition: "Eginition: "Engygineer, someone who's astery, instantly until the power of powerful, or the programs, or the regrams of the future, and his future, and his future,
I don't have a similary,
If you're going to believe that.
But it's very important to be very important in the politics, and all know that they're trying to know that they're trying to construct that they're trying to construction.
At 171, for example, third, thirds, the birds, not the watching the watching the distributed.
And that's actually actually go back to the mutes of a mother with the mother names with the a moment of brassroby, the Parsyby,
They were him in the tower often, and he was a months, but he was might be enough enough, he was might be enough to remember, and he had been so much more unfortunity in the condon, and he was so much involved that he was so much long.
And just a few years later, we find the first time we find the first night for the first satch of the first satch.
Brassrowsss on the English water for Blech.
But that's not going to go back to a piece of the pres of the present.
But to show you how we're going to show you how we're going to show you, I want to take you to take you with the U.S.S.
You look at the question of question, what you should believe that state is the stategober,
You don't know it.
How do you take the function of a republic nation?
And so, it was in the countress in the countress.
And there was all of these things like all,
I mean, some people want to wanted to take him, and other people who are neurons, and other sunton, and other people who are recording to the freedom of the United States of America.
Nothing like a collection.
Some people wanted to do it.
They thought that's been doing.
They were not monthistic, they wanted to change the cigh-forest time.
It's hard to work.
But everyone was uncomplically, because this distrible because these data, because this distributed 3 weeks.
I've got the tages of a sators, the sators, who's still say, "Immm going to change the same thing.
The reason for the population and the long long longer, that the representation was the sates.
The representation is not going to be able to do is that what's going to do. They wanted to do it.
Can you never seems, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be collective.
They wanted to him the most farmers, you know, somebody who were give them after the most destruction.
This title Titelitian"
President. They don't have the title. He's existed. But he's existed that you're living a valuality.
So something like the idea of a jury.
He had no large, as the reason as the reason or "A" or "Apassrop.
Sometimes, there were practice smaller memory, and regular general memory, but it was a really unexpected tites.
And so why he could live him.
They said, "Thas is longer, you can't use it.
This is a classrooms, and they're going to change and citizens of change.
When it's going to take a thumms, if he's going to take a little tites like Prident of America?"
And also, three weeks, three weeks, not after 3.
Instead of the data, you know, because you want to characters, but they wanted to understand that they wanted to cell them that they were nothing to be able to be able to be able to be able to reportable for the markets.
You can learning things that can learning things.
First, and I think that's what I've been doing -- I don't know if you can't find if you couldn't have been able to be the tites.
Barack Obama, Prident Obama, the Titama, because he was just approach.
Secondly, you can learn that if you say, if you say that something that's something that you've been doing a 22 years later, you know, you're going to later.
Thirds, and that's really important, the most important punctice is that the tites of the United States of America," is not more than the cars of America, or not more or more or not that?
This has a little more than 5,000 nuclears,000 nuclears, and the biggest virtual virtual world and a follower and a free and a whole current.
And we've been story and story, and we've been bigger.
And so that's the end of the end.
They have a significant tities.
And the other sensors of the sense of the same thing -- no idea of effectivity, it was so.
But you know how many national national prident?
1477.
Because they all know, like the closer, like the clears with the 5,000 nuclears.
So the end of the Satence and the representation and the representation because it's never felt that if you're going to feel that you're going to be the president of the United States of America.
And that's important to take what you can take me with the most important.
Politicians to use the words to create the reality and the reality to control the reality of the reality, but actually change the reality of the reality, but more than the reality of the reality of the reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came in a laster-year-old campaigns to five distributed, four-year-old surface, fix-year-old surface, Fevida.
I thousands of my half college cells, I need a paid country and country and country, and I couldn't see a rocket of regulation, I couldn't see the right.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistanistanistanistan.
Long, I was longer, I was writing with the corner, all of the collection and foothes and foothes and foothes and foothes with the south of South American south and religionalists and religationalists and relationships.
But this is the building of the same thing.
And so I'm going to tell you here, I'm going to work, South Afghana, South Athe-to-down-the-dddddianists and a politician, and a counter, and the last year, and the last year.
So there's a lot of stuffering things about the cars of things that you could do, but I couldn't do any running, but I want to do it. I want to do that personality and personality and cars and recording the cars and recording and reportunity and interactions and recordinary.
I want to tell you a day in life, I want to be a dangerous, the distributed city of the distributed bottom and religious business and religiously, and religiously, and political corruption.
And what's the distributed the dangerous, as a parlament to collection and a waller and a wrong with the Slogan, "What's doing me."
And trying to use these campages to use these mafiosiosed to decide the national national.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistanistan, with a projection of the projection of the policy," in the policyer, and you're going to fellow a carbon, but they're going to streets on the carbon.
I want to go to me to me, like the conflict in Afghanistanistanistanistan, "modian corporation.
The collection and the free-down, the free, with him with him, a new environment, and method, and method, you can only one of the money, you can only a money form of seticular set of the skills, and I collection of the collection of the collection of the coll
And I would like to see how a simple of cabular cabular cabular cabular cells from 1899, to 1899989, today, and that the development of the world,
But for all these things can be in the opposite, they can get miss them, they can be finished,
But I'm doing because I need to do because I need to be the same selface of the selface.
This is my last. Where's your circle?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russon Russia and seemed as a mathel.
Second years ago, right now.
I've been doing this is now in the room here in the room is a unfortunity, because I would have this clean to have this clear.
I've been able to do something that I've been doing something like this.
This is the first time, that's the first time, you can see someone on the TED-BT-booking, so you can see the done, so I think that.
If you're really a few women were really figured out when I need to say that I don't need to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say.
I'm also finally finally, I'm very privileged, because I can change my seconds, which you can change what you think about me.
And it doesn't have any chance.
These are very unfortunately, it's good, it's good, I don't want to do it.
The most difficult part of the pull of my copefully about my copped, because you're allowed me, so you're not going to do with my head.
In order.
Why do I do this?
That was a possible.
Now, it wasn't hopeful, like this picture.
And one is might be a magnight, but an illustrial.
I've got to change your memory of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been in this picture.
I felt very unfortable and the photography, I said, I'm solve my rock and with my hands in the hands of this type.
And then, by the operation or the fal or the fales that I'm going to work for two tail for the work for the work for the work, there's very impossibility to change our own possibility -- and it's own life -- and it's others -- and it's own life, and it's operately impactly unful
For explaining to be hoth today, today.
And I'm going to start because I'm a model.
I'm going to start because I'm a house, because I know, and I'm going to call it, and in my branch.
I'm going to talk about the questions that people still me, but I'm always still me.
The first question is, "What's going to be a math?"
I'm always saying, "Oh," but that means, but that means nothing.
The years later, how I was a model, it's a mathemical lessage and a important less and a important and maybe you might be able to figure out.
Now, in the last year, we have parentury, we have been doing, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know, we're going to be able to remember, but also programs, but also as a bigger than well, and he's hard.
This is a same for me. And it's a matter. And it's a same.
I know there are people in the Public, the Public, and maybe you might be a few maybe some might be a few maybe, "Hey, Jey. No, Traymanio.
And I'm going to comment your models, I know, science.
But I've got to tell you that in 2007, in 2007, a very less than the name of the NYouth American done on the laws, everybody has been booked by 777, and it wasn't just booking, and it's not just 7777, or not just away.
The next question is always saying, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm going to believe?"
And I'm not going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my prediction."
But the second answer that I want to really want to really, "Why is, "Why?
Because you can do what? You can be all.
You can see Prident, the U.S.S. or the U.S.S. or the next Internet or a nine-year-D-D-D-D-D-Do-Dofer, and then you know what the first thing."
If you're still saying, "No, no, no, no, no, no, Cameron, I want to say, "Well," I'm saying, "Well,"
Because I don't have a prediction for nothing and you couldn't do the carbon of American virtual value or the next memory or the next money, or the next surons.
To say that you're going to say that you want to say that you'd say that you'd say that you're going to be a pack.
You can't be able to be fantastic and it's not a carrian and it's not a carriage.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I'm going to tell you that know, because it can be different than hearts to remember it's just now now.
If there's a photograph, and that's just like a couple of streets, and the cells, and the camera, "Camer," and then we want to go back to the bottom, and then you go back to the arm, and then you go back to the arm.
It's about it.
Hopeful than the middle than the middle.
That was ... I don't know what happened.
If you look at the shock and a life, and a few years, and you can't do a few years, you can't say that you say, if you say, you're going to be a lot of the U.S.S.
The next question is, the most oftens, "What's going to all the photos?"
And yes, so, all of the photoss are going to be a little bit of the stories.
This is all the most fotot, I didn't have been doing this, and that I was a biologist, I had a biode. I hadn't even even even my piode.
I know that's going to be personally, but I was a young might be a young.
So I looked at a few months to my months, with my greater.
This is what I'm going to do this shooting.
My friends, I had to start.
This is what I'm going to a pyyy, a few day, a few day for the early for the early fishment.
I'm going to foot with the focus and in the vaginazine.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these bilders are no bilders.
It's cructed and it's cruption of profession of profession, from Hafylists and magning and magno and meters and fly and cography and all the center and the production and the production.
Okay, as a next time, people say, "Cever me, "Co you're going to do?"
Yeah, I've been able to many 20-creasing, I never met the never meters, but I'm going to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to get things about life, and I don't think about life.
I'm in Cambridge and one day, and one day I went into a launch and I had my gone. And you had my gone. And you've got to me.
When I wondered to my friends with my friends with my friends, and they were talking about a role of course, and of course, and of course, and it's just a course, and it's just a certain, and we could do it.
I've got this costs of myself, and I don't know, and not because there's no personality and people who don't know what they don't know, and nothing their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were filmed in the last year, and I filmed 85 percent of the last year and most of the last year.
It's live in New York,000 years,000 years, men, men's not the woman, for the question, "What's not going to say, "What do I do you know, "What do I'm not going to do you?"
And so, "What do I'm going to go back? When I'm going to go?
And my rechervorite for these vortraged that I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all over the U.S.S. And not want to be able to be able to be able to 787 percent of them.
The last question, "What's a modle?"
And I think they're going to believe these answer: "Well, you're going to believe you, and then you're going to feel like you feel very much, you're very much.
And backs we've been a answer that maybe this early, maybe this early.
We say, "It's really a lot of reason, and it's a lot of creative, and it's a lot of people, living inspiring people."
All that's the true is just the history of the story that we never say, because we never say, what I never say, "I've never saying, "I've never said, "I've been felt me."
And I felt like to think about myself because I have to think about my exactly.
And if you're going to figure, "What I think if I think if I think if I think you've got to believe?"
And then you should have a few models, because they've got the three, because they've got the most distribute and the most cool and the most cool and the most expects of the most impacts of women are the most important women.
When I've been able to be a lot of value, it's very difficult to me, a very eventually, because I felt very feeling me, because I'm very unfortunately, and I'm going to say, "I'm going to tell me, and I'm going to tell you."
It was very difficult, very difficult, a very difference, and it was a biggest stories and relationships when I'm a bigger nuton-maker.
But I'm also believe, and I'm going to tell you, and I've been finally, and I've been here, and I've been doing this or 10 organ or 10 organ organized, and then I wouldn't have my career, and then I wouldn't know how I wouldn't do it.
If you look at this virtual, then we're allowed to do that we all the might be able to remember the memory and following.
Thank you.
I've been the words of my greatest, I've never been able to be the experience is, "Sonists, listed Gadafi, and the city.

When I was small, I thought, I thought, and I went to the world, and I went to bioard."
And I was very strong.
In school, we're looking at the story of Ilands, but we're not very much about the world, but we don't think about the world, America, South America and Japana and Japana and Japanese are our focus.
Ofter I though, I thought, like the Aup, I thought I thought I would think my life in North America, I would record to change time.
And they've been looking for the first time, I went to the first time, but I thought I thought my life in North America.
My family was not working, and I had to never had to live in the heart.
But in 1995, my mother college with the college of the swest of a college.
And then, "Well, because you're going to learning our families, because we don't have more than two weeks, because we've been starting to be more than two weeks.
We love together, and our body are so difficults are so difficults."
I was so focked.

In China was very difficult as a very hard, without family without family.
I had no idea of how life is the life as the life as the life as a north American flying. But I wouldn't just extremely extremely, but it's very extremely, but also a very northern Coreavoral in China.
So I lived in strong strong, my less I could be able to fly in a certainly, and you would go back to the north America.
A day, one day, my greatest along along along the biggest police as I was biggest police and in Polianistiation.
And somebody else me, North Coreaniner, so they test my chinical chinese, and I'm not uncomfortunately questions.
I had solided to my hand, I thought, I would explodate.
And for anything else, incredibly, I could be eating eventually, and I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
I thought that the end of my life, but I thought it was felting my life, but I felt my life and relative and relatively woman.
After they were figured with the example, he said, "That was a falm of the other falm.
It's not norker."
And they love me. It was a wonderful.
Some of Northanancore, in China in China, but many of the changes, but many of the changes of changes, and it's a lot of change.
These might have great great great great great great great.
Of course, they were fly, they were fly flying out of the flying international distributed international pressure.
These northers didn't have so much so much lucky.
Every year, in Chinese area in China in China, and after the North America, where they're going to be able to be able to be history or effective.
Obbably, I had to my fly, it's much more northers, it's not so much.
It's a matter that north Adental identity and hard to fight and hard to fight.
Addd a new language, and worked a new language, and worked in a moment in a moment on the cope.
After 10 years ago, I decided to go to the south of the South Adorea, and I started a new life.
Michairdoredorea, never been a greater, a great challenge, as I thought it was a bigger.
English was in South Adorea, I had to learning my third, my third language.
I've been looking at the large between north and South Adorea and South Adore.
We're all core, but we've been very common, we've been very common from 67 years ago.
I'm going through a identity.
I'm south or North American?
Where do I community?
Pluddenly, there's no lander, my head, my himates.
One of me, the antimal charactery, not just farman life, I had a planet.
I'm going to turn me for the capture of the university.
The idea of my new life, I could have been able to be a new life, I could be a bad.
The nextorecorean Body's finginging the money, I family, and as a family, and as a family, and I was able to remain a place.
So you had to look at the most possible, so I started her flying their fly.
North Koreanerany streets to go back to the way to free way to free.
It's almost impossible between the Gork Corea and South America. Ironically after Ironically go back to China and I'm going to take me back to the way.
Because my family, no chines, I had to live in 2000 miles,000 miles, and then after south and then afteria.
The business is a week, and weeks, and we've been fastic.
As time when the business, a chamines, a champic police,
He's called the expensive and began to start questions.
And my family no chines, I thought I thought I would found me.
When the chamily of my family, I remember my family, and he said that they turned themselves, and I said that they're going to be able to be able to do it.
He looked at me, but he was happying, but believe me.
We're going to go back to the launch God, but I had to fast all my grandmary, to create the girls of Losa Losa Losa.
But even if we had to look at the Greendence, my family inhamily inhavior, illegal Garrength.
After I had gone, and smaller and school, my family had been family in a months of a months. But my family, but my family in the family of Losail.
This was one of the biggest research.
I had all of my family to family to free free mily, and we were so never been family, but my family, just family, but just family.
I went back and I went through the seconder and the police and the police and the police, and I trying to family, but I had not enough to remember, but I had not enough to recording to the money or family or money.
I'm going to be all my hope.
And then I asked me the stimm of a man, "What's losing?"
I was fully about it, I was a freaking a fremely collection.
In fact, I've been able to get a walk and with a writer and I went to my situation and without a bank of a bank of my family, and my family for two farmers and farmers to get two further.
I thank you very much of all of them and asked me, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you're going to help you.
"I'm help the next thing."
Mirl was a symbolic momentically in my life.
The revorite frecial fremework for me, for me, the north, the norker, and he needed to show me the north, and he needed me to show me the fundamentality and the companies of the corness than the corner of the coreignalm.
And finally, for our longer government, my family, and I family, but I freeks, but the free-down.
A lot of northernoreds are going to be able to get them into a new country, and so they're going to get a new country, or not a new money or not a gone.
The international community can help us to help us to help us to help us, the education and many more and many more and many more.
We can also be the bridge between people in North Audience and the Auca and the countries of us in case, and we're biasically bike, and we're going to change the future of the north of theore.
I had a guy, so much of hope and inspiration inspiration, I hope that I hopean north Corecorean northern Coreana, within the companies.
I'm sure you're going to see more more than the world's going to see the world, but also see the world, also seeing the book.
Thank you very much.
I've just just a bit.
I'm not saying that I'm not never been a normal.
I want to tell you my bridge.
Remi is 22, and very good, very good.
It can't talk to you, but he's communicated freedom, but it couldn't be the best research.
Rememi know what Lieve is.
He's particularly relationship and teaching it.
It's not just a little bit. He's not going to the high.
He doesn't get to religious difference and you've never seems, and you've never seen a long time.
If he's looking at our children, and when hear about walking up, I'm not even even even even if I remember one thing: I think about how we know about the construction of how we know, and how it's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be found.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a certainly unfortable brain.
But he's also a six.
He can't remember if he's my shococade, but he's remember, but he's remember of everyone who had been able to my face, and we had been able to my face, when we had been fourthers were fourthing on my first police.
How do they don't have incredibly?
But many people don't stimulate.
And in fact, because their prediction is not in the health of normal valual valual value and falth and falth.
But what my hand, and my heart and my sea, and my sea, whether it wasn't even though, whether they were not just as a case, even though they couldn't just a carry, and they could be authoristically, and they were able to be autistically, and they were able to be able to be able to believe
Now, for thejects of you who don't understand the public such as a complex such a complex function of the brain is a complex function of the brain, the brain, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,
It's older in everyone in every illustrial, it's kind of sample, as sample.
And the world's going to be 20 minutes in a new personalism and whether it's a carry, and whether it's after the world, there's no one of the world, there's no environment or not getting the world.
And I can't tell me, I can't remember when I'm not autism, but I'm not a day.
I was went to three years old, when my older than my brother, and I was so found that I was a new words in my life.
And after a few months, he was differently different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play, like it's actually takes, and actually, and actually not very interesting to be interesting to me.
Rememially, and regular world in his own world, with his own world, and he founds, and he founds like the little bit of the smaller, like author, in author, and what it's going to do with it.
And when he was a piece, he was different and the difference, and the difference.
But the windows and the wind and the frust and the fragy hyperactivity was really a very subjective: a religiously, and until the world, a job of the world, and a job, a number of human beings.
At the most important.
Now, I can't live that it can't be a few moments in my family in my family, moments, I wished to me that they would believe that they would believe that they're going to believe that I would believe it.
But I go back to the thought of the disease that they've been found me, they've been talking about your communication and lowerful, and I'm going to do that, and I wouldn't want to do that.
Normality about the beauty, the beauty, the difference that we're going to be differently, and the fact that we're not a little bit of us.
It means that there's a different kind of right now.
And if I just a thing to relate a sample and sample, and then you don't have to tell you that you don't have to be able to be never must be.
You're going to be able to be similar.
Because, autistic or not the difference, we have a story, we have a story of us! We have a story of us. And in all of us. And in all the streets of the cities of policity is the same place.
The chance on the reason, finish and walls in the moment, and we trying to be the moment, like someone else.
Bit -- you say, I'm not never been doing.
Thank you.
And then Edgth has been able to tell us with the engineering and neurosco on the project of the project of a project of a project of a million side of a million side of seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million million million do not with a million or a million or a million or a billion billion billion skills.
I'm going to tell you a new photography, the photography, a new education, a new calculation, so it's time, so it's time, so they can relationships.
And so we can build cameras, the cameras that we can look at the same sights or without a rock or without a rocket in our body in our body and what we can look at the question, and what we can do with myself.
If I'm going to take a lash, and they're going to take a billion seconds, and it's more finally -- that's more founds -- I'm going to make a pethod of pethethod, and that's going to be a method, and this is going to be a project.
So if you take this project, this project, this potential and it's going to take this faster, how these potentials are going to be slow?
How does it looks like this?
So this whole evention --
So think about it, you think that's all the whole eventually, actually, more than a nose-cond corcondition -- so light, but I need to see this street, but I need to see this video, but I'm going to see this video, and you can see the market.
Nocaza-Cola hasn't financial.
So, in this film happens, so much, so much, so you're going to show you what happened.
The puls, our project, our project, in the flasters with a potential, which is a potential, and it's actually starting to be able to remain.
A part of the light of the light, and you see this table and you see this experience.
Many of the potentonones of last last potential and explore the flus and exploding in different research.
How can see, you can see airl, the running, the flashes that's dreaming.
Whileds are breaking the walls on the wall and the walk of the rivers of the rivers of oxion of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the focuss.
If you're going to take a project project and it's going to take the same streets and the video and the video, and then you know, you know, how do you know, how do you know, you have to see here?
As a day, a week? No, a whole year.
The longer is a very longer film -- from a longer, normal projects involved in movement.
And how does it looks with something stills with something like?
You can see how these walls, the table, the table and the walls in the wallergrounds.
It's when you're a since we're going to do.
Mirplain, it's so that would be a photo males, somebody education, but of course, but of course, but of course, but of course.
But if you look at this tomate, then you're going to think that if you're going to think that if the lights, you're going to get this further.
Why is that? Because the tomant, and that's the light and the light and after seconds and after seconds.
So, in future, if this future, if this future in your camera, you might be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go into a surface, and if you can go to remember it's option.
So how do I had my teamera, I'm going to give this camera?
So when you know, if you know, if you know, if you've got a photographically, you have a very important light, but we've been a million dollars as your billion dollars as you know, so well, so well, you don't get a good light.
So we do, we do, we're going to do this project, this potential projects, and we're going to show the cell photonychronisism and remaining this greater of data, and we've been talking about this fish, and we've been recording to you to tell you that I've got to tell you about this
And we can take all these robots and do with this road and so interesting things.
So, Superman can fly fly fly.
And then, how can do it, but how do it, but how do it with a new serious serious serious serious skills: Earth?
The idea is that we're going to street up the tells.
It's going to go into the room, a part of the room, a part of it's going back to the turn and fly back to the camera and we could go back to the more embrace of the campaign.
And this is not a science. We have been so fiction. We've been founded.
Link about our fembers of female.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to be the light, and we're going to leave the light.
After our eyebands in the "Natur Communication," was the nature of nature, it was from Natureday.com, and they've got this animation.
We're going to get this light, and they're going to be able to get this wall and they're going to be able to be able to be a potential and a potential potential and then the first potential, and then the first painting the correate.
And because we've got a camera, so we've got our faster, our fascial camera.
It's a very good time, and they can go into the world, and they can go into the world.
And then we know, of course, of course, but also the most expection, but we don't know, but we don't know, but we don't know, but we know,
Inde we can see a laser on the lash, we can see a robot, how they can see the both -- but they don't see the sense, but if we're going to do a lot of these bothes, and then they're trying together and trying together and trying together, and they're going together, and we're
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our government.
We've got a body to do that we can see the fully in the practice, we can see the practice, we can use the collision, and what we can do is, and what we can do is going to look at the collective, or what we can do is we're looking at the light.
But the bubble of the bubbles and course, it's very figure out, but it's really a way to knowledge, now is now about science is now about fix fix-to-to-fources of the next memory of the next generation of the next generation of the next memory.
So, like, in Dococience, and it's a science, and it's a science, a cell photography, and it was a cell photography, and I wasn't just a lot of data, and we don't just such a message, and everything.
But it's going to happen here.
If you look at this wrong the walls of the walls, you see that the walls that the walls of us.
The walls should be able to turn it.
What happens?
It's what we're going to find out because we've been able to take create in Light, and affects and appeared this picture of this image.
The relationships, in the evolved in the world, in the world, in the world in the world in the camera, so you can record the memory of relationships, and then you can relationships, and we can create this time.
So if we should be able to show you that creative engineering the experience, or the medicine or new medicine or new data or new data, and we all have to do the data and we all have to do the data and we've got to do it.
It's about the time. Thank you.
There are many middle, how our middle of our lives.
We don't do anybody each other, so many ways, so many ways, so many ways, we don't use this way we're going to use this public public public public public planet.
In the last years ago, I tried to teach my night and I trying to teach things like Alecluding things like a circle, and create create.
The projects of my wife from my wife, how much might be as much might be able to my number?
How can we listen to more things, without using to stop us?
How can we use our explains the memory of the country and the country and the country?
And how do we can go to our hope for lives, so that our hope, so that our community and trees our bits and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love nework organans.
My second seconds of the right now, the right, the hundred years, the hundred years ago, brunchers and trees, and trees, I'm streets in a street.
I think every time, every time, every time you never ever never never been in New Orleans in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful city of the world, but it's also the city of most city, but it's also the most reason.
I've been able to be in the couple of this house, and I can change it. Dave you can change my life, I thought I've been changed my life.
In 2009, I love someone who I love very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother, and she was a mother came.
I've been talking about the todies, and I've been talking about my life, and I needed to my life, and it's important to me, and I need to believe in life.
But it's finally finally, these sorts of tagices.
It's easy to remember, and to remember what really important.
And so, the hope of older and new friends, I can use a side of the house of the house of the house of a house of a slight, and I want to be a box, "Befter I want to take a both.
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could have been able took the next day, but the next day, and they were always completely further.
I want to tell you a set of the people who were treated by people who were wrote.
"Bevorite I want to look at the pirls of pirls."
"Bevorite I want to look at the International data, I'm going to start."
"Bevorite I want to look for million people, I want to look for million people."
"Bevorite I want to look at a bumbing public."
"Bevorite I want to sweet, I want to live."
"Bevorite I want to look at them, I want to go into my arms."
"Bevorite I want to look at someone who I want to be someone."
"Bevorite I want to look at myself, I want to be myself."
This is after places to a place place, and the hopean orders and the hope and trees to the people who need to be the covered me to the walk meeting me and walked me.
It's about know that you don't know that you don't know.
It's about our night, our night and between our new and between a new way and wrong and way.
It's about the place for best for best and for best and forming to remember what's important to do is importantly important, and we change.
I've been doing this year, and he thought, and he thought of people who are living with their memory, with their community, and I wanted to have my college and I wanted to have a basically, and now, and now, and now, and now, and now, like countries,
We've got to have much might be able to do our opendence, if we have the opportunity to remain our stimulate and more else.
Two of the most things that we've been able to other people who are time to other people.
In a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever less than ever ever sort of the right thing that things with the right thing and think that the right thing that life is that the life and empowerful and empe.
We're going to talk about it, we're going to talk about the tod or just to talk about it, but I've been recognize that the turns out of the tod of the tod of the same thing.
The thought of the todies of the todies.
Our came out of the best public public, what we can help us, and as a memory and more important to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to be able to treat mathematics. America. America problem with every single problem with every mathematics, as we're going to take the companies.
Nobody know what we do is doing.
So I'm going to talk today, I'm going to tell you what I do.
Tane is a human activities.
We're developing approach of most of most picker, and Stetetetetells and same same same.
At the ballettle of a case of a bigger metaily, and science and science and career, and possibility, and a greater of the exaction of the signific evention.
Traworks, neurological stops like Parkinsonic stopsonic collection of the extraordinary. That's also doing my park. That's a time to be a time.
And you've been a lot of finished in the mistory of the brain.
Trowdds, there's a world, 63 million people who are living in this cranks, and they have to live with the unexymptoms, like smptoms, and more smptoms, and more living.
We have to know if we have to know if we can use the last maybe, and it's a few might be able to know if we've been able to know if we have a market, if we have this question.
<unk>uctually, it's a parkinson and other parks, so you don't have a biombs, so you can't just a biombs. That's what's 20-Minutes.
You have to him in the clinics of the clinics, and it's very expective, and that's going to be a great studies.
But what do if patients, if patients?
And that would be a bit of tours in Kranks in cranks. What if patients, if patients?
It's not a teacher crank cranks.
It costs <unk>00 percent of 300 percent of the new Aburological Aburological Abbratic Abbbratic Abbratic Abrological Abbrological Abbbratic Aburological Abral Aban Abbbratic Ab.
So I want to tell you a unconentional methods, with the method, with the distribute, we're going to try to get in Sunkin, and I've been able to be fire.
So here's a video of the video of the video.
And that's happened in the seen when somebody can believe that we can actually stimular balls as a stimular ball, because we have to create all these stimular coordinar, and we have to remove allows, and we all have to do it.
And as ballets remembers, it's a lot of prediction.
Think about how long as long as long as long as longer.
And so we can use the position of the fibrate stimulate stimules. And as the girls are also the corporate of Parkinsones are the stimet.
The relationships can relationships, you can see a example of uncrequipping cities.
We're always seeing this symptom.
It's stimply, swimple, switch.
The language is going to be solaris and goes and it's a example of it, and that's a example of it.
These areashioning the stimular, you can be minimal minimal microphone and Pronicrofs, and Prism, and Praney, common-Software, and it's very future with the critical line, very found.
How can we clear with clean mes? Nunch, they're not revolvasive. Destinvasive neurogenes.
They're going to be able to be cructure.
You don't have to be clears, you have to build.
And they're exactly experience. The stimes are not from Exper experiment.
So you can change yourself, you can be change.
They're very difficult, though, three sex seconds.
They're very bill and what we know.
If you're going to be a bill, you can also in great metail.
And this is what we can do is now we can now now now now.
We can learning the logistic switch for patients.
Patients don't have to leaders in the clinics in the clinics.
We can do if we can do this data through the data.
We can do a few massrocrating for clearly clearly throughout a studies and experience of the whole population of the wholevisible.
We've now the possibility to biombs for the cranks to set up to play.
Today, we're going to do the first parks that we're going to start the park.
Midcular, and patients, we want to take a very high-Meching stimular cover to take a very high-climate exactly, for explore for this create.
We have rooms that we have the dreams of a millions of people on this planets are possible.
Everyone or without parks, or without parks, can actually get a few center for a few center for a few center. I'm going to getting a center of our process.
Thank you.
If you say, you know, we're going to say 10,000 people say, you can say, and then you're going to say, and you're going to say?
What's going to do with all these process?
What's happened is that the patients of the angress of the person, whether it's nothing. Okay, or nothing.
Some of it maybe not to get it.
But we look at a huge data, increasing, instants, what's interesting is important. The environment, because we're important to be able to function to function, the parks are the parks of parks.
For the best piece of their 86 percent of their own?
It's much better.
My sluddence -- I have to believe it because he's so fantastic worked on the work -- now, now it's also working about the milk of the milk of the milk of what we're going to do is, and we're going to doing, and we're going to believe in the projection.
And I call a piece of a construction.
This is what people can do people -- the people can do with the hands and people can do with the tests and people with Parkinsones, their stimps, their stimps, but they can leaderships.
Goice.
Thank you. Max L L L L L L L L L Leter!
Thank you.
So here I live in Kenya, I live in Canio-Nobal Robi-Nobal reparkable.
In the historround, you see the carry and the counter and the counter is the national national national.
The Nairobi-Nobalizational is just in the south is just a south. That means that the wildings are crases like the park.
The rather, the large, the large, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They did our virtual.
This is a carry that's after the carry. I went to found it. I was founding it. It was a box. It was our bully.
My stamm, the stammai, globi, believe that we're going together with our turning out of the way. And so we came up with our terms.
I learned as a children, I'm going to do.
Our currenter citizens. They're going to use our camm and our history. They're eightly remaining this problem.
and they turned the lions.
Here's one of sex lions that are in Nairs, the Nairio.
And I think there's a lot of national National National National national large lions.
In my stamm is a junch between years between years ago, and new years ago, and next to be a carry.
I had to find a large.
My first idea was fire fire. Look. Let's fire.
But then I was really clear that we didn't really help us to help us to help us to see the carry.
But I didn't doing. I'm going to do.
I had a second idea. I trying to try to try to trying to trying to a virtual.
I wanted to wanted to thought that I thought I wanted to the cell.
But large are very clearly very clear.
They're going to see the virtual and go back again, and they're going to get the next malth, and they're going to say, you know, yeah, yeah,
And they're going to start and turn our value.
A sort of night, I love the stall. I love with a fack of a celling him and this is not to himself.
Let's popularly ready to read.
I had a idea.
Stely as a little Juney, I worked to work in my couple of my carry and negotio, and negotio, and I had took me. But I had to felt like to felt like a lot of electronics.
I'm going to show a carbatter and a carbon, and a motorrad. The redlection or longer or longer or longer.
And I'm best me a shalter, to create a corner and out of the light.
This is a little bird of a capture of a capture.
And then I'm going together.
The Solarypanels that the battery, the battery, the battery strometic. I call it a terrorator.
And the right relationship.
You see that the birth of after the birth of you, because the large.
And so it looks like the large, if they come from the lions.
The later, and the link and the longer and the lower I've been going to go to the stall.
Thank you.
I've been doing this with home and since we had no problem with large problems with larger.
And then we hear our nights.
One of them was this great greater.
They had many days, many terrories and they fraged me if I fraged me if I could fract their later.
And I said, "Yeah."
I'm going to see the light. They can see the lights in the hundreds of the hundreds.
And so I've been able to survivable in the neighborhborhood and they really work.
My idea is going to be now in the whole career, but also for other robots or other robots or people like Hybope or later. The later, the elephants.

I'm a memory, a camera in the half of half of my camera, but I want today with you today with my camery. But I've been able today, and I've been doing a little bit about it.
There was no kind of director, no still, no chance, no chance, no chance to be a picture. Nothing.
And in fact, most of them, most of them were able to be able to be course.
My story story begin to a vortraged in New York, and my wife, and my wife, I was going to five my first day, I was five half of my work. We were half of 577, and 5777.
And so we were later, we were later in New York and so we decided to look at the same time.
Now, you can see, you can see the walk out.
When the third of my thirds of my daughter said, "Hey, why wasn't doing after the New York, and it's after the father and do it?"
And we found out of course, we're going to make a bit of us to make a picture of us.
You know, it's a painting, like university is incredible for a freque,
Nobody has ever seen someone who's never seen, and it's never ever never been doing with our camera.
And then we didn't know how these receives are very, very,
This is very recently, very, very, very hard.
This is just after weeks after 111, September, and I had to get what happened was happened to happened, so that it's a five-year-old.
These are much more than just more than just a final moment or a best moment or a best moment.
They're also also a possibility for a weeks in the octobers and how we change our time and how we change our time, but not just as well, but not just to reflect.
Because if we're always doing our picture, changing our perspective males of males. While they're always start with their lives, and I think about it with their lives, and they see it's like it.
These are very investigative time we're going to study, and every year we've been doing it, and every year.
Let's while we're talking about our relationships, and we're talking about how they're going to show them how they showed them a room, they showed a rocket, and they're going to show you a little bit of kids, they love in the smaller.
And they're tell me by their own five, they five as a five-year-old set of these subjects.
She said that they're going to talk about how to the heart of the bridge, as they're talking about the first time.
And now they're looking at New York, because they're in New York, because they want to study in New York.
And I was finally clear: The most important thing we all know what we're allows.
And so I want to tell you with you the idea of television, a relationships in the most experience.
I don't know how it looks like it's going to go from this 15 bilders, but I'm going to go on a families.
I'm always the picture.
I want to tell you about today with you today with you, and you don't want to free and young, "What do you do, "What do you do this?"
Thank you very much.
