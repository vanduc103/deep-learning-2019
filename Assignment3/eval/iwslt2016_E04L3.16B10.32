When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the clener of the clener fully.
My father was hearing on his little bit, like Radio the neighborhood of the BBC.
He looked very happy, what happy was pretty unconomously uncomplicated, mostly, mostly depressed.
He rather: "The Taliban.
I didn't know what that means, but it made my father, and it was very happy, very happy.
"Just can you go to a right school school," he said," he said.
The morning I'm never been used.
All right school.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, and I was six, and it was board to go to school.
So I felt after I five years, I five years long as Junched my <unk>unched my <unk>unched up, not more communities, and it's not going to go to a chime.
So we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we could never get a different way, so it could never get a different way where we could go.
We first found our books in the left, so we were looking like this, so we would go out, as well,
We were in a house, we were in a house, about 100 metal walls in a small wall.
In the word was, it was incredibly, but in the summer, it's unbelievable.
We all know that we had our lives: teachers, teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the unfortunately, the unfortunately for a weeks because the Taliban transformation, because the Taliban transformation.
We were never been used to be about how much they knew.
Do they were?
Where do they know where we do where we know where?
We had angry, but we wanted to school.
I had a great great great great great memory, in the image, and turned into the image and turned.
My grandfather was his time.
At the outside of a decided provinced provinced afghanistan -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and it was done.
My bilks mother, but teachers, teachers.
That's what they do.
Two years ago, they went to the ruhest of our house in a school for mouse and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this was the first -- the first in his family, the ever ever ever explained a school.
For him, it was a children's a children would behavior, also his trots, but also his taliban, troting all the taliban,
He looked like a lot of bigger risks, his children, his children,
I know that I'm going to be in the years ago, sometimes, sometimes, and sometimes of our lives, from our lives, and the perspective and the perspective.
I was good lusting lusted to my father. But my father, "Thather, you can hear me. You can do it.
And the money can be done. You can be done in war, you can become your house.
But one thing is going to be after you are always going to be here, and even if we have to do with our bubblut for your blood for your bubblish, we need to do that.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I was in a country, which is the war.
When less than 6 percent of my old women have a higher than the second, as the second, and if my family, and if my family, and if my family, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm standing here, as stold Absolved Abury College.
When I was after Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was the family, because he was a family because he was a bad, because he was a bad, he was the most of the first time.
He doesn't just not just with my high school, but also the first woman, but also the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the first woman.
My family believe me.
I have great trees, but my family has been greater greater trees for me.
So I'm global both of 1010, a little bottom of 1010, a women for the education of women.
So I've been helped, SOLALA, and maybe the first internative internat for marghanistan, a country, a country, a country, a country,
It's wonderful to see how the shoots of my school with my school with great each other emboards chances.
And to see how their parents and value for them, like this, like this, and I decided my parents for me, and decided all the way.
So as ahmed. That's not really not really the name and I can't show you, but Ahmed, the father is the father.
And then, a board, and he was his taughter and he's been in their daughter and they're the tath of SOLA, just to get a bombs on the streets.
When he was to home home, came to the telephone and a stimet, and a stime, he would be faller, it would be trying to school.
And so he said, "This me now, if you want to use your future, but I'm not the future of my daughters, I'm going to use the older and overcome."
What Afghanistan, I recognize something that I've been able told something that's most often, most of us, most of us, most of us, the explane, and the father, the father, and it's also the written.
That shouldn't have today that our mothers don't play in our experience.
And they're going to be holds that are highly possible for a lot of a lot of a lot of their terms of their terms of their terms of society like in a society of the unfortunity of the unfortable.
And the taliban went to the taliban mouths -- because it was someone -- because it was someone.
But everybody each other, everybody in Afghanistan, the shoulder the school.
Afghanistan, he's looked from America, so different.
The Americans are remembers like us.
I'm not going to change the changes are not from drawing and changed the U.S.
But if I was in Afghanistan, if I'm sounters in my shoes, and their parents who are sure that they're going to use them, then I see a lot of parents, I'm going to make a lot of wall.
Afghanistan is for me to a country of the hope and the unities, and it's impossibility, and it's possibility.
And I think they have great trees.
Thank you very much.
All of what I do is, also, I was born -- my life -- my life was divided by the working in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, I see, I see young, but it's not -- I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Kenia, Algeria, Algeria and Somalia, algready, algary working with African countries.
I have a found for a full of a name project, and every project, and every project that we're going to stand up.
I was switched.
I thought, 21 years, we're going to be good people and good people are working in Africa.
Instead, we found all of us, we were all of what we were doing.
Our first projects what my first projects what my first book "Ripples of the campaign, a whole thing that we wanted to show you how name the sambasias, like Norbas.
We came with italia South America, in South America, in this way to help to the Sambia, which leads to Sambi-Fi-Fi-fi-fi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bucombia and Talia.
Of course, the answer has no interesting, so we didn't have a interesting, so we're doing it for the work, and sometimes they also look at them.
We were first instance, we were in a such an economic talue,
But instead often, why they didn't look at the same time, we just say, "God,"
"Gerade, the right now to recently the people to talk about the people."
Of course, all of all wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, and we had been so big, they were so big, they were so big,
We couldn't believe and said, "Sambn't believe, like Landwink."
When the tomates, and rots were about 200 nights about 200 nights, and asked all of the flows and asking all.
We said to the Sambia: "Oh God, God, the Nilpeful!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have no landwirt here."
"Why don't heard her, "I'm not heard?" "I'm never been asking us."
I thought, we were so greated, but I was so great in Africa, but then I saw what the American, which is what the English, which is what the Franzanzanced, which I was data.
We felt like to the nilprofers.
They should see the university -- you should see the university we don't know the university of African people have been decided.
They should be the book "The Aiddle Aiddle of Damba Moyoy, it's a sambian economic economic economic.
The book was 2009, 2009,
We have the changed the African continent 15 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has told you.
Let me just you just simple.
Let me from a Africanine what we've been story.
We're important people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are two poor, like we're only two poor, we're patrize them or we're patriarch.
Because words of the latic word "pater" which means "V" what "V"
But they have two different bedbed two different beds.
Patriarchal, I'm a different culture, as a different culture, as a different culture. "I love my children."
Patronising: I'm a different culture, as a different culture, as if they were my distributed.
That's why people in Africa, "bwana, Chef, Chef, Chef,
I was wonderful, when I was the book, "Small," by school," and he said, "Ston," he said, everything, if people don't want to leave them in Ruzzzzil.
This should be the first principle of the hilf.
The first principle of the hilf is Respect.
Today, the morning of the heart of the conference, which is a stabet, and asked a stabet and asked, "Can you don't think that's not a stadocial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to talk to people, and he's never talking about a system, and it's never been in something that never been in something that never happened to be a motivated, but you're going to be the personalists of the personalists.
What you do -- you do is -- you're doing.
You're never never been a community with ideas, you're looking at the sky.
We don't work from broad.
We do create in Caf<unk>s. We do in Caf.
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally free friends and find out what the person wants to find out what the person.
The most important thing is the lab.
You can make someone else a idea.
If these person don't do that?
The person for the person for the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own words is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge, because no one can be allows to be allow.
The person with the idea hasn't have the science, but it's not available.
A lot of years ago, I had this one: Why didn't get to tell you what they should do to say, why don't hear to say why don't hear to them? But not in community.
Let me tell you a brain.
There's a problem with general community.
Nobody have never been participant and they're never saying what they're never saying what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they see.
Planation has this blindow.
The clearly people who don't know what they don't know because they don't know because they never get together.
We worked to do this to do this to do this to do this, to do this social infrastructure, which is not existed.
A new books, a new book.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedy of the bedy, who's going to find your couse, and in the cafully, and in the cafully, you're going to find your lives information.
I have this instance, West Australia, trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try.
I promoved to the time and trying to get the time, and I try to decide where we should say what they should do.
And so I love to helped up in the first year and he had the first three days, and I had three days. I him. I him. He was him. He was him. I was him to him in a garage, and I him to him to the past collective.
I half this 5 50 fish, and I'm working on the wonderful throws a fish for 60 center for 60 center for 60 collaborators, but for 150 dollars for 15 dollars."
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do this?
How do you do. I said, "I do something very, very, very switch.
I half the mouth and hope."
So -- so -- so, "Make the government: "Make it."
We have been done in 300 general community.
We have 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are trying to understand the university.
Peter Drucker, one of the best companies, the story, story, story, story, a few years ago.
Peter Drucker was philosophy, before he was petered with companies, and Peter Drucker said, Peterman said, Peterany: Plancial and economic society and economic society."
Planation is the todes of the company of the company.
So you built Christch, without know what the course of human course, which is the course of their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this together to get to a totally.
You have to tell them Disk and Privacy, and Privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 course.
Can you're a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the people who are intelligence?
For the presentation, you have the most existence of the most existence?
<unk>rary, embracted people. The eates.
I want to say that the companies of the right way, the right way.
We're at the end of the first industry revolution -- nich revolution -- nich fossily, fuels, and suddenly, and systems, and systems are not so highly.
The connection is not aftermasism is not after.
The friends of the Instandard of the instandard.
We need to look at how we have to look at them, like we have to recordable ways, today, transportation, transportation, transportation and corresponding them.
The technologies are not existing exist.
Who will be this technology for the large revolution? Universities? Civersities?
The government? Do you're going to be!
It's going to be approach. And they're going to do it.
I'm going to make a future in a future in a future of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were eggging, took the future of New York City in 1860,
In 1860, they came together and speculated what happened in 100 years, which was happened with the city, the short, the short of New York City: The Stadtack New York City,
Why? You look at the curve and said, and they said, if the population in this tempoint in this tempoint, they needed to be six million possible to people who are uncomplained to the million possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Because they went to the mistake.
1860, they see the bad technology that lives from New York,
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, 19001, in the United States, 1001, 1001, 1001.
The idea that one technology to find a different technology, the running. It was a little bit of little fabrics in the heart of a small fabrics.
Thinks, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a brain to work with company to work with companies.
And when he was told them to do it.
And so, they don't talk to you and talk to you.
And when you have to tell them them, you have to use them, engaged and living.
Then you have to tell them the absolutely truthority.
From the smallest firma, all of the country, all of these things, three things that needs to be able to understand the production, the consumption, and his financial production, and his financial production.
Rates?
We never have a single person who are produce a few person who can buy something produce, and it can care and to the money.
That's something existence.
These person was never been born.
We have founded farmers and the 100 iconic firms of the world -- Carnegy, Westing, Westing, edison, Fordon, Fordinary, Google, Yoogle, Yoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed all the world, all the world has been a community of the world, just one: No, just one person who was a person.
Now, we leave 16-year-old in Northumbers, and we started to start the first two side of Richards, and we started two side of Richard Bransonsons. The first Autony biography of the first side of the first side of the first side of the first side.
No one "It" and 32 mal "wir"
He wasn't alone as he started.
Nobody green a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So what can we're going to make a community, in the painting a little bittery, and you have a little bars and bars and bars and bars, and your engaged to do is what you're going to do for this, what's going to do with young this element.
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, you can use it? Can you're going to go to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't say, "My, you know that I'm going to finish?"
We activate generate community.
We have groups of freedoms that can be using the companies that can use them in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the intelligence of the intelligence of the intellecture of the culture and economics.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be where it's to be age, alice in the Wunderland.
The penness University, I mean -- a Dozin for communication -- at the communication -- at the communication.
I had angry --
Rightly angry. Agstering these students with their big brains and their big big books and their books, and their big books.
But as the faces that the face, he was like Alice as Alice as Alice, as Alice, as Alice, and a cannin, and a citizen world.
I felt like I felt like I was as I was conversation with the students. I was first. I was talking about the thought they had to decided that other words and wanted to do that other words.
I believe this taken this type, it means it's great collective communication.
We needed to be big created computeration of our scientists and in our scientists and insures to change the world.
Because our scientists and insures are thejects that our greatest problems, like to example, like, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know what it's not going to understand it. I don't think it's not going to believe that we don't think about ourselves.
But these great society, not to come together when our scientists and inside our scientists and in their wonderful.
So scientists and ingency, bits, clearly, clearly.
I want to show you a few answer, like her how to make it, like her, we can see that the science and the science and the technology and planet, and spane, and spanted.
The first question that you have to tell us, and it's not to be, and?
Say, why was just a serious scientifically, so relevant for us.
Say not just that their trees are different structure, but also says, but also says that their trees, and they're also the mask of our cooks, because they're important because they can understand it's important to understand.
And if you're going to do what you do is, then you're going to be after.
For after are a hands of change, for change.
I couldn't be able told her, and pretty much, but why don't you say, but why don't you just change the time, and time, what's a lot of us?
Our idea to make a thought about how their nive is not the same as their nive.
How astein's a lot of myself, "Make the things like this -- but not just like this."
You can tell us something about economic scientifically known as a single biombs, without compromising.
A few things are there, there are some of them, examples: Because, stories and analogia. Asia, and the way to us in your banned.
And if you're working on their work, then the stories, then the stichpoint.
Hab you ever asked young, why it's "Ston's called "St?
What happens when someone else? Are you know, and it's going to get this point, and with these points, and with these public public public.
A following this is not just long, but also slowly to very longer to very language, and we're going to be a lot of our brain and though we're going to be fast.
These example of Genevieve Brown brown is much we're going to show you that the special structure of the special structure of the tremendous structure of the inspiration for the inspiration of the effecture of the effect.
The ticks here is a single thing, just learning, simple satzing the audience, when it's audience, if it can be audience, or the pictures and the other senses, and the other senses, and the other senses, and the other senses of the other snaps.
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these taps and the wonderful and the science and the science and the technology.
And so the inside I've been story, I've been telling me, with the <unk>Nerd in my eyes, I want to create all the same thing I want together.
At the eurer science, economic stories, and education, and education, so that's the audience, so that's important, and multiplicated, and multiplicated the complicated with the economics: And society. And society. And society.
So scientists and instants, if you look at these same same time, clearly, I think it's unbed me.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy cancer a cell phone in Syria,
With a handy can actually after after a protestail and a protestail.
And with a handy can take a long time, it's high school, and books, and books.
All that's a handy.
I'm a year, I'm live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the time in this city.
There's a hundreds of people who are hundreds of people who went to change the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989, and we're in 1989, and all these people who had changed, and changed a handy in the task.
Who in Saal has a handy there?
Hald you high.
Half you high phone, half, you half!
Half you high. Are you. One, a blackberry, which was a black.
These are many. Fast everybody has a handy.
But today, and my hand, and my handy, and I changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 350 ceils of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the EU.
This is the reliny is called Rightliny to record.
This rid of the space, every particularly telephants in Europe, everyone in Europe, everybody internet Europe, a bandbread information.
Who do you get? Who do you know, why?
Who went a smart?
And if you're a handy broke where you're going to be.
All these information are going to be six months to two years to two years of your telephants or your Internet or your Internet or your Internet.
And over Europeana are the people who are the people who don't want to say, "This we don't want to do."
They said, we wanted to these idea of the process.
We want to selful self-mote in the digital time, and we don't want to be the telephants and Internets and Internets, all these information about us.
There was applies, Journalists, Prianists, "This, we don't want to say, "This we don't want to say."
And here you can see how to see how created people on the streets of Berlin, and said, "Freeks," and said, "Freeks."
And some people say that, this might be so that could be 20.
The stasially was the brain in Ostantize of Ostancial.
And I asked me to ask me whether it works.
Can you really all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my telephant, the distribution, the distribute telecom, which was the biggest telephants in Deutch, and I asked them, and I asked them all the information that I was talking about her.
And I asked them, and she was a time, and they didn't get a right answer. Nurero. Nurer Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life, because it's protocolled.
So I decided to do a general memory, they wanted to have a memory, because I wanted to have this information.
But the distribute telecom said, no, no, we're going to be done.
At the end of the end of a same with them.
I'm going to get back to the beginning, where they all sorts of information.
Because in the cultural recording the boundary that the evention of the evention of the EU.
So I'm going to have this half of environmental environment.
And on the CD was this:
350 ceils information.
First, I saw it, and I said, it's half a huge date. My metweet.
But then I realized a while, this is my life.
These are six months in this date.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I do?
Because you see where I'm where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information, I want to go to the publicity.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show the people what I want to show you what I want to meaning.
So with a time with Online and Open Data City, so I've got this here.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reince, and you can recently and raciously, you can go back and back to the back.
You can do every single school, I do this, after.
And you can see how I can see how I found from Frank, and how many years, and how many of five years, and how many answer I do.
All that's possible information.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
First, it's just like, I'm going to go to my wife and we talk to me, and we talk to a few mal with myself.
And then I went to a few friends and they run a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of friends.
And after a while you and you start to go and you've got this research, and we have this huge communication.
But you can see how people with yourself, too, too language, they're looking at a bedback, they go to Bettle.
You can see all of you can see all.
You know, you know, the central figures, about who are the groups of the groups.
If you can see the information has to see what the society is what the society.
If you have to create these information has the society, you can control.
That's a book for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect eventually, like you can see a society, because you can see a society, who knows a possible, who's possible, everything is possible to this information.
And these information are going to be months, 6 months, in Europe, in Europe to 2 years.
How I said, we're going to say that all these people in the streets in the streets in the history in 19898 Handyys in their terms of the task.
And the stasially, who had been approached, who was a constration of the done who had been wonstration, who would never have been a leaders, then it may be happened.
The case of the Berliner master maybe not states.
And also thought that's not the ice of the ice.
Because today, information and companies, so many information, like many information, like they can wrote, and often, infline and often.
They want to choose the opportunity to understand the opportunity, and they want to learning all the time.
But even self-f-mote and a life in your life in your life,
But everybody has today for the self-mproduce.
They have to do that every day, you have to help.
So if you go home, you say, you say, you're a wonderful century of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say, you say your attack, just because it's because firms and state the possibility, and they have to species to species, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe you, you're going to believe your telephants, you've talked about you.
So in the future, every time you're going to use your handy, you're going to use yourself, you're going to use the same time in yourself in yourself.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spiritual: Fellrestaurants, books, books.
So the city, the city, and solved, and solutions, the Names South Central Central, so it's something else, and it's changed him in South Ath Central, which is something like the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Giritual, snell, snell, books, Brazil.
So like 265 million other Americans, I live in the food South Central Los Angeles, the central Los Angeles, and the Drive-byear-byear-byear-byear-old.
The comic is that the drive-thrism more people, more people are doing more people.
People are south Central Los Angeles in South Central support.
The fattleibility is crate in my fourth is center. B. Five mal highly highly hills, which is about 15 billion.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how you feel like you wouldn't feel like you would have no curiously house if you could have a lot of malth when you look at the negative expectations that the best explanation has been able to see the best system.
I'm going to buy the running and trying to buy as buying as building like building.
I see the decisional diversity like Starbucks like Starbucks.
And I started to start that the stopped.
I capse that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and it's the solution.
At the same thing I had no latest latest than 45 minutes to get a pesticians to get a pesticians, not with pestician.
So I pantantast I was a food-wth-wday.
It's a piece of land, we call Parklay.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing that it's the city.
But you have to pleasure it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is my connection, and I want to have to half."
And I decided to half.
So I came and my group, and my groups, and we found, and we found, and we food, and we food, and operating, and even to panel, so the whole program, so the whole program.
We're a kind of prediction of general prediction, and we're all sorts of all the city and all of the whole stadies and all of the city, and everything we do, and everything is cost.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then somebody else.
The city came to me and he was a practical practical and said that I had told my garden, and said that I had to be a richard to a rich ancient.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A rich anticipating anticipation of normal levels on a stage, that's your country is it?
And I thought, "Cool. Her's it."
Because this mal wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times, Times, Steve Lopezzzzzzzzzzzing and talking about the story and talking about a middle of Green, and you're longer, and they were a petition.
We're going to give you in the hands.
My strates like this, and he said that they're study and said they're doing what we do.
So why would they do that?
LA. It has been in the United States, most of the United States in the book.
They're best 67, 12 current.
These are 20 central Parks.
That's enough flying 725 million tomates.
Why didn't find the phone?
And it's a plant of a plant, you know,000 sames.
With the boh of a dollars in the wall of a dollars, you're own older and community of 75 dollars.
It's my homebotic, I say, I say they should be able to build their own food.
His eather, it's like his own money is like his own money.
Look, I have a connection in South Central.
I went to you. I've been there. I've been there.
And I know, part of this part of this, part of this process, and I was fabricity, and I fabricians, and I fabricity.
Look, I'm a couple of artist.
Garden is my graffiti. I'm pick.
Are you like a graffiti-known, the wall, the wall, I change the wish, I beautiful, and Parklana.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece, and the piece and the piece of my dreams are my dreams.
They would be surprising what the experience, if you can use it as a landwand as a landwand.
You can't imagine how he's a sunlume is a sunlum, and how people building.
So what happened?
I've been experience, like my garden for the first instrument for the expection and the result of my fourth.
To the community to change the community of the collection of the board.
We're the board.
They would be wonderful how children are going to be affect.
Garners is the therape, and carrying the most action, the most eventually, particularly with the city.
And then you're writing, you're going to get.
I remember this mother, as this mother and their taughter, it was came to 10:30, she was came up in my garden, and I came out and I came out.
I'm sured me, because they were bad, because they were there, and I said, "Wis, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without the street on the street."
I went told me when I saw people looked like me, and I saw myself, and I was just asked me, and I asked me, "Fin," and I said, "Fin, you're not going to be afraid."
And I said, "Thum team, I don't have any angry, I don't know what they clear.
And so it's notice on the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take them back to their healthy, I want to take their health."
At the other time I lived a garden in this observed in Dow Downtown LA.
These are the types that are helped me to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how it was picking it, and how they had to see with her mother and their mother and her mother and her grandmother, and it was to see how they changed it, and it was also changed to see a moment.
Green reason, so it's about 20 garden 20 generation.
To our environments, so 50 people, and they're all free and do that, and they're all free.
If kids, if kids, it children.
If they takes, they food, they eat domata.
But if they don't get it out of them, if they don't get it, it's not going to get it, and creating it, it's always predict whatever they're always trying to them.
I see somebody who wants to work, but they want to work in this thing -- I see -- I see -- I see the same children who are exactly on the pad, and they're looking at the pad, and they're going to go.
The marning I see a childhood, where we can training these children, where we can children to care their community to get after life.
And if we do that?
We couldn't think about the next building Washington Carvernment.
But if we don't change the collection of the experience, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my planet. That's what I want to do.
I want to use a whole walls on Garmante, where people can use the same way that people can teach themselves.
I want to take a high school, and they're going to take it into health caf.
So, don't understand me.
I don't talk about costs, because I don't know, because it's not after.
The comics of night is that you have to be able to be able to behavior.
I talk about it, people who worked to work and children, and children from the streets, and they're going to leave the street and the eating, if you're going to let your own, and if you look at the own, and if you look at the barm.
So what I want to do here is this is the sixy to do.
I want to be all of the ecological rebeing, Ganger, Ganger, Gangerous memory.
We need to remove the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger.
Gangerously, you're going to get with <unk>
And let's the waffected.
If you want to do with me, you want to do me to tell me when you're in a couple of students and a meting and a meting, where you want to do something about it.
If you want to do with your book, you're going to get to your garden, so we can use some small sounds.
For. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite switching Oxford English English World English Well,
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No,"
Even though, in 19th century, a big definition, a better distribution: "Ein Snostergoster is someone who is someone who is someone who is an instability, or the program, or the painting of parramid, or the color, and the power of power.
I don't have a similar, which is.
I think that's what I think.
But it's very important that words in the centrum of politicians, and all the politicians that they try to control.
17171, for example, third, third, the British Parlament, time not the words of the distributed.
And the thing that was actually happy to the mutes of a man whole names with the a management names of the crosby, who was the parlament.
She was helped him in the towerrible, but he was a muton, but he was muty enough enough enough enough, and he was so much enough, and he was so much unfortunately so much unfortunately so much.
And just a few years later, we find the first night years later for the first night, like Brass.
Brassed on the English word for Blech.
But it's not going to go back to a return on a reflection of the present.
But to show you how Worte, like Worte and politicians, I want to take you with the United States, as they were going to take the unability.
You look at the question of question, how to build the state of the state of the state, which is to call.
You knew it didn't know.
How do you call the leadership a republic nation?
And so, it was a long time in the Congress.
And there was all kinds of possible progression.
I mean, some people want to call them Gouvernments, and other survey, and other smallenge, and other, against whatever, and other people who are the United States of America, what's the United States.
Nothing so a present.
Some people want to call them a nice nice.
They thought that's been dangerous.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to a best for a best time.
It's how they could have work.
But everyone was unbelced, because these dangerous because these distributed 3 weeks.
I've got the day, I've been doing a sator, the strange, "Immer the same thing.
The reason for the conversation and the long time was that the representany was the representan.
The representany didn't want to do that what's going to do. They didn't want to be.
Can you call them, and they're still possible to be able to be after his neighborhood.
They wanted to him the most mostly, the most mostly, yet, yes, the most family.
This title was "President."
President. They didn't existed. He didn't existed. But he was a violence. But it's someone who was a vamermation.
So something like the idea of a Jury.
He hadn't have more reason as the relationship, "Apassive" or "Apassroom."
Sometimes, there was a practice smaller community and governments and government, but it was a really unbed title.
So this is why the satell him.
They said, "This is long, you can't call them President numbers.
This cerles have to get a bit of a countries and fromlands and citizens.
Who will take him, if he's going to take a thumbs like President of America has a practice?"
And also after 3 weeks, not after 3,
Instead of the collection, you know, the title of the title, but they wanted to understand the colds, but they didn't want to get away from their own possible for their own possible for the method.
You can learning things about three interesting things.
First -- and the first -- and I've been doing -- I don't have anybody who hasn't even though, if somebody had been delivered.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title, just just the title. It was just about it.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government say that something was something that something was -- then you're also 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important, the most important point, is that the Titel President of America" of America" by America" or more like this, right?
And that has a more than 5,000 nuclears, and the biggest volence, and the greatest volcial volence and a full of drops and a full of the world.
It's really a story, and story has given the title.
And so, the satense of the end of the end.
They have a respectables.
And the other sorge of the same thing that was so much of evention -- now it was so.
But you know how many nation have a president?
147.
Because they all know, like the case, like the cerling with the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the satense of the sat, and the representan, because never, because never feeling the whole thing you're going to feel that you're going to be the president of America.
And this is the most important thing you can take with the most important, and I'm going to make me.
Politicians trying to use the reality to create the reality and the reality to control the reality, but actually changed the reality of the reality, but more than the reality, the reality of the reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came in a laster with a laster 50 requires to the campaign, a 19-year-old, a 19-old, fixed surface, Florida.
I thousands of my bad couverse country, a pair, and I needed a pair and metal lands of regulation, and I couldn't see a running.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
She was long as I was biggest, and I was biggest pyjama-Partyjama-Partyjama and footing and footing with the southern South Asazon and religionalistic southnters.
But this is the building of the self-field.
And so I'm going to take here, I'm going to have afghane, Southe-Proletttta. Atheist, atheistic couple of atheist, and a radic couple of years, the last year, and the last years.
So there's a lot of things that we could do a lot of things that you could do a lot of things that you couldn't make a personality. I want to make the personality, and I want to do the personality and cars and cars and carrying the next today and record and recording the new record.
I want to spend a day in life in life, a distributed -- the distributed to be a communists like <unk>Pope, like <unk>Pope and political turns out and political couple of political couple of political cars.
And what's sonsterihad-Ganger, as a parlament to candident and a choice and a choice, and I'm going to do with the Slogan: "Whad, I'm talking."
And trying to use these campaigns to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosios.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan on the ground, with a project, "Rockness," which you're going to take a policist, and a fal controlss the streets of carbon and cars.
I want to look at me, like the conflict in Afghanistan, my memory of my memory, and I wonflict.
The war and the war and the written, and the free of came to him a new environment, and Mode and Mode and Mode, you can only a mothers, you can only a mothers, and you can do a married and even a marriage of the cell physical collection of the course.
And I would like to see how a simple simple cardizens of cabulative cards, and it looks like approaching approaching a dial process today that the world's creative equipments in their waterials.
But for all these things can come into the victims, they can get to miss, they can be missed.
But I did it because I have to do because I have to understand itself because it's own.
That's my favorite. Why is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since a less time, I was a model.
Second years, just said, right now.
I've got the feeling now here in the room, in the room, because I would have been doing this clearly not to do this cleidemic.
I've been a little bit of a way to do something that.
This is the first time you're the first time to see someone who's after the TED-B-Book, so you can see that I think.
If you really have a few women were really harder than I need to say, when I need to say that I don't need to say that I'm going to say that.
I also asked that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds, because I can change what you think about me.
And so everyone hasn't have any chance.
These are very unfortunately, it's good, it's good, I didn't want to be a good.
The most difficult part of the most part of my head is to copefully, because you're going to be allow me to do you all of my head, so much more than I don't do it.
In ordination.
Why do I've been doing this?
That was a person.
Well, it wasn't hopefully like this picture.
At the surface is also a surface, but a surface.
I've been able to change your memory of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been in reality.
I felt very unfortable and the photograph, I said, so I'm solve my hand and my hand in the hand in the hand in the huge.
And then, from Operation or the false or the fal brunch of myself, I was very important to work for the work, there's very impossibilities, and our own own own surface -- and our own lives -- and our lives -- it's a bighborhood -- and it's a bighood.
For to be a hot to be a hot today, to be honest.
And I'm standing on this book because I'm a model.
I stand up on this book because I'm house, because I know, white woman, and in my branch, and I call the sixy Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary My Mey Mars.
I'm going to ask the questions that people who are always standing me, but on the else way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I say, "Oh, I was always been decided, but that means nothing.
The years, as I was a model, like I was a model in the genetic less and a important experience and maybe you may believe this experience.
Now, in the last century century, we have been beauty and yet, and yetrically defined, and yetrically programmed, but we're also programmed, but also hospital, but also hospital and hospital and hospitalf.
This experience was for me. And it's a superience for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in this point, and maybe some maybe some maybe a few maybe a few mothers, "Halt. Nai, John Sman Small.
And I'm comments, I'm going to get your models. S teachers.
But I'm lived with you, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very evention of the NYU, all the models on the country, every time, and every single time, and that was booked by 767, and that wasn't just about 27 or two percent of the productor.
The next question that I always been said, "Can I said, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm going to be a model?"
And I was like, "I don't know, I don't know what it's not in my connection."
But the second answer I want to girls that little girls, "Why?
Because you can be? You can be all be going to be all.
You can be presidentinent of the USA or the U.S. or the next Internet, or a ninjurga-Herground, which is what it would be irrrrrral, which is the first."
If they say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Cameron," I want to say, "What's say, "What's my camer."
Because I don't have a consider and you couldn't have the Cheadurin of American vogue or the American vogue or the next money or the next melax.
To say that you're going to be a model, it's so that you want to say that you're going to say that you want to be a potto the less.
You can't pick it, and it's almostic and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I want to tell you about the other than history, because it can only be able to decided now.
If you look at a photograph, and the light is enough, and you're going to tell you, and the course, "Cameron," and then we want to go to the carbon," and then you go to the box, and then the poor, and then the poverty, and this poorry, and then you go back to the point, this point,
It looks like this.
Hopefully completely more completely.
That was ... I don't know what happens.
If you look at the school and a life, and a few years, and a few Jobs, you can't say that you can't say that you're not going to say that you want to be a lot of the United States, but you want to go, "10 years" and then you're going to go to the difference.
The next question that I said, "What's going to talk about this photoss all the photos?"
And yes, so pretty all the photos, but it's just a little part of the story of the story.
That's all the first photo, and I didn't know that I had the first time I had a bic mal, I had a biciode. I hadn't even my piode.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young.
So I saw a few months took a few months with my grandmother.
This is what I'm the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is I'm on a Pyjama Party, a few day ago, a few days ago,
This is what I'm with the foot and in the villagazine.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these images are not a bilder of me.
It's Konstructed and it's construction of a group of profis, from Hawylists and mothers and foot and foot and pictures and pictures and struction and the non-struction.
Okay, askay, asking me, "Crostsssonst you want to do?"
Yes, I have too many 20-Abs, I can never have never been able to train, but the things I can get the things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to get things in the real life I'm talking about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, and one day, I went into a launch and I had a launch for me. And you had my campid.
When I fully, I went to my friends with a food food food, and they were talking about a redlection, and of course, and of course, and it was a "It have a choice," and it was a high-bortheist," and we could far.
I have this costs of things that I don't get my exception and not know, and there are people who are personality and there are people who don't know what they're not a personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and I filmed, 85 percent of school and mostly 85 percent of the latinos and mostly men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men and Latinos, for the question, "What's not the question?"
So what's like, "How do I'm going to look at? When I'm going to look at?
And I found my research for these talks about these talks about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old maries in the United States, and these numbers, and these numbers, they're won't have been won.
The last question is, "How is it, it's a model?
And I think they're going to be a little bit of this answer: "Well, you're going to use a little bit, and then you feel, then you feel very happy and fability."
And Backage we're going to give you a answer that maybe these einds.
We say, "It's really great, so much to talk about creative, and it's greative, inspiring people, living inspiring people."
All that's true, but it's just the half of the story, because what we never never say, what I never never say, "I've never seen before, "I feel like, "I feel like me."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think about my exception.
And if you ask yourself, "What would be happy when I was happy if I was going to be happy and believe?"
Then you should have a few models, because they have the throws the most figure and the most important harm and the cool cool cool, and they're the most important cools and they're going to understand the most women.
When I didn't have this talked to me, it was very difficult to me, a very difficult to me, because I felt a very uncomplain, because I felt very uncomfortunately, and I was very unfortunately, "I'm going to get a paper." And I was going to tell you." And so felt like to tell you." And
It was very difficult, a very difficult, a supply, a bad and rasking stories, if I'm a bigger, if I'm a bigger.
But I'm also happy and felt like this, and I'm going to help you, and I've been here, and I've been here, I've been here, or 20 or 20 or 30 years or 20 or 30 years or 30 years, and I wouldn't have anyone who I wouldn't want told my career.
If you look at this talk, then you're going to take a little bit of the power of the power of the power and following ourselves.
Thank you.
I've never been the words of my grandmother, which is the exilts in the exilm of life, "Son, list city, empower.

Nah, 200 organizations were during and unmitable, and unmitable to the case of Gaddazi, fast 300 terrips, 300 terripolis.
After 33 years in Exil, I came back to Lybia, and with a single Ethusiasm, I started to the tempicshopshopshopships, human education, human education and food.
With a wonderful group of women, I women who I wrote the women, a movement of women, a movement of women, firement of women, and it's the public heads of the public public public public heads.
And I'm a very difficult, I'm a very difficult environment, a environment, which is always polaris. Aman politic politician politics and expressed by Dominan and expression.

At the end of our Initiative, and he was successful.

Intolerances, evolution, and Rached the Icones of the economics of the revolution.
I'm not today today today with the experience of our reverse, and the number of our reverse.
And I'm going to talk today today that we've been as a nation that we've been able to create the wrong decisions.
We have our priorities, we've seen our priorities.
Because the numbers, the writers, or significity or significity in Lybia.
Hat the rivers, the rivers and the white and the way between the white and men and men and men Fried female violence?
No, it didn't.
What's it?
Why is going to be our society and dominated, and dominated by self-ship of self-cominan and the explane and the explanected as women?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been the only way that has the white of the women who had the women who area and the grandman.
Our society, a national Dialogue and collectional and create choice as they were breaking the end of the end of the end of the end of the polarization and decision.
Our society, the qualitative construction of the way that they need more than they need more than they need to be more than they need to need to be able to need.
We need to stop up in the names of the corning and a day, and a day of the rock.
We need to start to start to do in the names of the middle and the gnave.
We have to develop a whisk, the following wrong the following walls, but also to do, but also to collaboratting, the rather, instead of constate, a consciousness consciousness.
These are the ideal that ideal, the ideal of war, the warning Lybia, to make free free free.
Because the Fried has a alchemy and in this alchemics to the feminal skules and maskins and maskines.
That's the years of the years.
And we have to exist, we have to use it, we have to do it sociopolitical.
After a visual called "Salam" -- Free" -- Free-dire God,"
The word "The Tradition," and all of the trees of the tradition, this is the same Arabic Wurbical Wortrahemic woods like the word "trabic vibolence and symbolized the whole personality to the whole personality and the personality of humanity of humanity of

So this was why he said, "My Gnade has been talking about my grand."
And so we're going to be all the gunning of the gunning.
Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought, my country, and I went to the world, and I wished "Nothing" to build the lower.
And I was very strong.
In school, we look at the story of Kim Il-Spection, but we don't learned about the world, eyes, eye, America, South America and Japana and Japana and Japanese.
Even though I asked to ask me, like the eye, I thought, I thought my life in North Korea, to a little life in North All right time.
And I saw years ago, I saw a public huge hinful high school, but I thought my life in North Koreai.
My family wasn't work, and I had to live with myself.
But in 1995, my mother was my mother, who was a browd with a collegin.
And then, "Well, you know, you're going to be here, our families, we don't have been more on this world, because weeks, because weeks.
We love together, and our bodies are so difficult together, we're so difficult."
I was so hard.
I heard told the first time, I heard that people in my country.
I went to the board, I went to the board, and I saw something that I can't get more of my exploration.
A smaller, woman woman, and a carbon, and a children in their poverty in their poverty in their face.
But never half them because all of them because all these so that all of themselves, and their families, and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big character in North Korea.
At the end of the end of North Korean Northern Apotting, and many more and many more and many, and many, because they're just because they're just because they're just a break.
Stromousands were always been half after all of myself, so that all of the country, eyes of China on the other side of China on the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side.
I asked me, why they had been there there, and we didn't.
This is a satellites of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the rivers Amrocast <unk>, the teil as a greng North Korea and China and China.
How do you can see the riversity, and it's very six and he's very six.
But many sters.
Sometimes I saw Leich in the river.
I can't say much about how I can't say that I can say that I can say that I can say that I can say that I was during the hunger of the hunger of chinaws.
I thought I thought I was a course of my family,
I would never have been doing that it was 14 years together together together.
In China was very hard to live as young maries without family.
I had no idea of it, like life as a life as a northanic flying his fly, but I wouldn't just extremely extremely extremely, but also it's also very basically dangerous, but also being illegal financial children.
So I lived in strange, I was in afraidentity, and you could be in a bad, and you would have a badfter North Korea.
One day, my biggest alption was true, as I was true from Chinese police and in the police and in the police and in the police.
And someone else, North Korean, so they did my chinese chinese chinese chinese chinese and stands and standing me,
I had solarly, I thought, I thought my heart.
Which anything else, I could be increasing, I could be able to be able to be able to be.
I thought that the end of my life, but I was hard to considered it, but I felt my feelings and possible questions.
After they were finished with the example, a relighter, "This was a false.
It's not a northernin."
And they love me. It was a wonder.
Some North Korean, in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had great great great great great.
Even though they were expected, they were finally finally finally free international pressure international Dpressional Dpressional Dpressional Dpressional Dpressional Dessional Dpressional Dures.
These North Koreanerinanins didn't even a lot of happiness.
Every year, uncomplains in China, he's been able to North Korea, where they're brought, where they're going to be history or public.
Even't even though I had a lot of my flies, it's much more northern North Korean.
It's tragic that North Korean, their identity and hard to survivality.
And after them a new language, and worked on a new language, and worked their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the first time I decided to South After South Korea, and again, and again, and I started to start a new life.
Michazorea, never been a greater, a greater challenge, as I was a greater than I thought it was.
English was in South Korea, so important that I had to learned my third language.
Audience I have the big difference between North and South America.
We're all core, but we've been very community, we've been very community of 67 years of the part of 67 years.
I'm a identity of identity.
Bin South or North Koreaninanin?
Where I'm going to come? Who I am?
Pluddenly, there was no land more, that my home, that my home.
Even't although to me the possible life, I had a plane, I had a plan.
I'm going to start me for the attention of the university.
Gera as I was asked my new life, I could have a bad, I was a box.
The neordan Borkorean Behehicle, I family, and when I was my family, and when Streets, and when my family between place to a family place.
They had to planted as possible, so I started to plan her flies.
North Korean, a uncredible streets to their way back to their way.
It's almost impossible north between North America, Ironically to talk to a flying back to China and made me back to China and made me back to China.
Because my family, I had to live them, I had to live them more than 2,000 miles through China and then after Southostasia.
The business is a weeks and weeks, and we were almost more fastic.
Atain, when the business was a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the except of all, and he started questions.
And my family not chinese family, I thought I thought, I would be found.
When the chinese examily, my family, I decided told him, and she said that they were doing their own person, and I was personal.
He looked at me, but he was happy, but happy, I think he was happy.
We had took it to the laotic Grength, but I had took all my grandmany to break the border of Laosaos.
But even after the borders of the border, my family inhaft, I was illegal gordership.
After I was gone, and I was broad and should have been family inner, my family inner, but my family, and I was bought my family, and I was businessed in Hadosaily.
This was one of the biggest running my life.
I had all done to try to family to family, and we were so family, but my family, but my family, just my family, just the southernic both.
I went back and I went to the second and the police and the police and trying to try to make my family, but I hadn't enough to help the money or money or money or money or money or money.
I'm slor all my hope.
And then I asked me the voice of a man, "What's los?"
I was founded about it, I was a friends that a friend.
In broken English and with a word and with a word, I was my situation and without my situation and without a bank, and numbers, and two numbers for my family and two northers to get out of the opportunity to get out of the visit.
I thank you from all the whole him, and I asked me?"
"I help you," not you told you.
"I help the north Korean people."
Mirus was a symbolic moment in my life.
The frequencymbolismbolism, for me a new hope for me to a new hope, and he showed me the Northern Corean, and he showed me the friends and the companies of fundamentality as affords of the community, and the northernocords.
South, after our long risks, my family and I remained to the family, but the freedom.
Many North Korean, they're going to be families, and soon they're in a new country, they're not going to start with a new country or no money.
The International community can help us help us to help us to help us, the education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the eye and the eye of us, because many of us have been able to still bias, and we're going to change them information and generation, and we're going to change the north.
I had a guy, so much hope and inspiration inspiration inspiration, I hope that I hopefully northern North Corean United Stational company.
I'm sure you're going to have a lot more recording northern North Korean, also seeing on the books of TED.
Thank you very much.
I've just a bit.
I don't say you're not saying that I'm not normal.
I want to tell you my bridge.
Remi is 22, and very well.
He can't talk about, but he can't communicated freedom, like a sort of the best red.
Remi, what love is love.
He's particularly explained and he's uncertainly uncertainly.
He's not just a big. He doesn't go on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious difference and imagine, and you're never been a launch.
If heard from our childhood, it's not trying to still the words, I remember that I remember a thing: how would we know about the consider, and how we know about the uncertainly, and how the uncertainly.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a absolutely unfortable general memory.
But he has a six.
He can't remember, whether he was my shocolate, but he's remember that he had a public projection of every collection, society, and he was fourth, as a fourth of the most policy.
How do they don't even incredibly?
But many people don't stimate.
And actually, because their constantly because their constantion of normal valual valual past, they're going to be about it.
But what my hearts and my soulter and my selector has been, whether this was that the case wasn't even though they were not as a bit of case, it was a bigger than it was a bigger -- it was authorist -- and evidence.
Now, for theject of you who don't use the public empower, it's a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, the social complexity, and sometimes the large funch of funity.
It's approaching in every individual, it's a different than Sami.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes are going to be a new personalized and whether it's a bad of the most important developments of the world, there's no responsibility or home.
And I can't even remember the first time when I'm not autism, but I can't remember, but I can't remember it.
I was born three years old, when my brother, and I was so on my brother, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months was that he was different.
He wrote a lot of.
He didn't want to play how it was really interested in the other babies, and actually not very interested in me.
Remi, and regulated in his own world, with his own world, with his own rules, and he founds like a cars, like author in a cars in a series in a series of autombs, which is what it's going to study and what it's studying.
And when he was slowed, he was different and the difference, and the difference.
But the woods and the wood and the frustrat and the neverage, and the neverage was something really a really a reality: a very sort of natures, a junning nature, a junning nature, who had never been a human.
At the way.
Now, I can't live that there was some of the only ways of my family in my family, moments, I wished to me that they were exactly how I wish I would like to be.
But I'm going to go back to the dingerminate, they've been talking about individuality, communication and love, and I don't understand that this is that this thing I don't want to turn.
Normality about the beauty, the beauty, and the difference, and the fact that we are different, and the fact that we're not a good thing.
It means that there's a different kind of rather than rather.
And if I just a thing to tell you, and then I could say it, and then you wouldn't be normal, you don't have to be normal.
You're attention to be a similar.
Because, Autistic or not, the difference, we have a story -- we have a story! Jedered, and in all of us, and in all the streets, and in all the streets of the ultimate opened by potential.
The chance on the size, fort of average and walls in the moment, in the moment, like someone else.
Bit -- you don't say that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Doco Edgon has a leader, and neurosed with this photo on the photo on the photo on the project, and with a projection of a million second, and with a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, we don't see the world, but the world or a million or a million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion b
I'm going to tell you a new kind of photography, the photography, a new education, a new calculation, that it's time they can make time.
And so we can build cameras, we can build the absolutely our sights, or without a beautiful small, or without a beautiful consider, and really, and really, what we can do with "Camera."
If I'm going to take a laser and him in a million seconds, and it's more female -- that's more female -- that's more female -- I'm a potential, and this is a millimeter, and this project, and this project is going to be a project.
So if you take this project, this project, this potones, and it's going to take this potones like this photones in the fly?
How does it looks like?
So this whole eventually --
So, think about it, the whole events, the whole eventually, less than a nanose, so longer than a nanoseclearly -- but I need to get this video -- but I translated this video to the video to the 10 billion light, so you can see the factor.
Noca-Cola-Cola hasn't financial.
So in this film is very much, so let me show you what happened to show you what happens.
The puls, our project, our project, transportation with a potonpaketon, a potonpaket, and that's starting and the bad.
A part of the light, after the light, and you see these excitings of the wall.
Many of the photones, the potential last last potential, and exploding the rivers and explodes.
How do you can see, there's airl, which is airl, which is the flash.
Whileds are breading the walls on the table and white of the reflexion of the rivers of own experience, you see the end of the end of the focuss.
If you take a <unk>-year project, and it's the same streets and the video, and the video to 10 billion dollars to see the fictor 10 billion dollars, how do you have to see here?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long film -- from a long-m -- from a long project in movement.
And how does it looks like a still billion picture?
You can see how these walls, the table, the Tomate and the walls in the hinter.
It's like if you're a text.
Mird it as a picture as a photo mal, some photo mal, someone who looks like a female, but of course, of course, but of course, of course.
But if you look at this tomate, then you'll see that if you'll see that if the light, you're going to get the light, that's not going to be done.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and that's the light and the light, and a few million seconds to get out.
So in future, if these future, if these female camera in your camera, it might be able to be able to be able to make it in a sense, and function, it's a fraction, and it's a fraction.
So how did my teamera, this camera?
So as a photograph, if you know, you know, you have a photographically doing very important light, but we have a billion light, but we're going to get a billion course as your bottom, so you get a good light like this.
So we're doing this: We're going to do this project, this potones, and showing this potones, and I showed it back and recording and recording this generation and combination, and we rebaby to record this fishing to show you the figure of data.
And we can take all these roohdates, and so interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can make us a new single, but how would you look at a new surgery for a couple of super surgery?
The idea is that we're going to street up to the door.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it, a part of it will reflect and finally back to the camera and we could get back to the more easily and we could use these more easily.
And this is not a Science. We have so fiction. We have so fiction.
Link about our femto-Kamera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to get the light.
After our country in the "Nature Communication," was published by Nature, it was by Nature.community.community.
We're going to get these lights, and they're going to get together and they're going to get together and this potential and a few of the potential and some of the potential potential, and then the most important pully and then the light, and then the trees.
And because we have a camera, the so fast -- our faster is -- our female camera has a few faster.
It has a very good time, and they can go to the world and they can look at the world.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the decision to the terrible operating objects, but we don't know what we don't know.
So what we can see a laser online, we can see a rooh-Bilding, how they can see -- how they're not really sense -- but if we don't really do a lot of these images, and then they're trying together and try together and try together, and try together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We can see a big, we can see the visualized, and we can use the practice, we can use the collision, and we can see what the collision, and what we can do is going to do with the collection, or what we can look at the survey.
But because of the blood and building, of course, of course, it's really hard to know, which is a while, now, now, now, now, now now, now, now, now a new picture of the next memory of the next memory of the next generation of medicine.
So, like, and we can't have a scientist, even a scientist, and it's a couple of science, a couple of the ultra-bottraphy, and I was clearly the data, and that all of the data, but we don't just know that all of the moment.
But it's also happening here.
If you look at this words of flashes, you see that the walls, you see the walls of us.
The words to us to be able to us.
What happens?
It turns out that we figure out because we've been ability to take away, and astant effects, and astein's an incredible effective.
The refugee, in the events in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, so that you can reflect the camera, so you can decide the construction of space and time we can create these connection.
So, if we should have to show us to the photography or the experiences, or the medicine or new data or new data or new data, and we all have data, we all have data and we all have data.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many possibility, like our lives.
We don't do any night, we don't have a lot of way, so many ways, so many ways, we're going to use this same public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public p
In the last years, I tried to teach more with my neighborhood and there are things like Acleber, smaller and create circle.
The projects of my questions, how much members like many members?
How can we stop more things, without us to stop us?
How can we use our experiences that are country and the country and the country?
And how can we do our hope for living hope, so that our community, so our community and trees our beds and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My selection is going to be a huge electricity, the since, the since, beds and trees, and Trumps, and I trust language, and I'm always been in the music.
I believe every time, every time you never have someone who never being in New Orleans a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful building the world, but it's also the city of the world, but it's also the city of America.
I'm going to be in the narrates and I have to beautiful, like I can change something that I thought about something that I thought about my life.
In 2009, I was someone who I loved very loved.
You had Joan, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, and it was suddenly and unexpected.
I've been talking about the death, and I talked a big disease for my life, and it needs to be a big disease, and I need to be in life.
But it's faster, this sort of mission, every day,
It's easy to understand what's really important to understand what really important.
With the house of older and new friends, I was a side of the side of the side of the house, and I wrote with a single tail, "Bevited the lucky, I want to be a boy."
I wasn't even words what I could experiment, but I couldn't get the next day, but the next day, and they were always completely completely always completely always completely always been always far.
I want to share a simple small, who were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to look at the piratterns, I want to be away."
"Bevor I'd like to sterply, I want to stop the International Datums."
"Bevor I want to look for million people, I want to singing for million people."
"Bevor I'd like to ster, I want to use a bumb."
"Bevor I'd like to say "nethavior."
"Bevor I'd like to look at them on my poor, I'd like to halms."
"Bevor I want to be a bit, I want someone."
"Bevor I'd like to be a whole thing I want to be myself."
This is after places, and this was a sense of places and the hope and trees and trees me to the hope and translating me to the window me to the window me to the time.
It's about knowing that you don't know that you're not all.
It's about it, our neighborhood and second and the way, and we're going to understand and way.
It's about it, please for best and to make the night and to make what we're going to make us what we're important to change what we change us.
I've been doing this last year, and I've been hundreds of living in the last year, and I wanted to build a wall, so I wanted to build a bask and I wanted to build a bask of countries like countries, like countries, like countries,
We have a lot of powerful powerful public public public public public voice and more with other people.
Two of the most of the most things that we have time and the time, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever, the things that are important to think about the right big blend and empowerful and empowerful and empower.
We're going to talk about it, we're going to talk about the death or just to think about it, but I've got to think that the idea that the death is the todiversity of the death is the most strong.
The media is translated to the death of us.
Our common population, which shows us what we can do when Individed us as individual and more important to help us more impossibility, and the most important way to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me, I decided to each other problems, a particular problem for everyone who are considered to create the companies are like companies.
Nobody knows what we do is that we do.
So I'm going to talk today today today you what I do.
Tances is one of human activities.
We're decided to most of most of most of most of most ballettle and Sppppppreciated, like you're going to see how you see.
At the ballettle of a similary ball great markets and ability to create a big massive and possibility, and possible eventually, which might have a genetic completely.
Traigerately, the first newurological stopping new stoppinson, this extraordinary funny. It makes my movie, and the balloy, the time, the time, the time was a ballervirtual.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the mind.
Trotime, there's a world, 63 million people who have to live in this cranks, and they have to live with the uncomptoms like school, tremendous smptoms, and more living more living increase, and more living disease.
We have to do that the research is that we can actually know if we can actually know if there's a few matter if we know if we know if we have a projective market, if we have a question.
<unk>rary is that there's a parkinson and other movement, so you don't have a biomarker, so you can't just a biombs. That's the 20 minutes of neurogen.
You have to him in the clinicians. It's very expensive, and it's very extraordinary studies, and it's never going to never.
But what would be if patients to do this test?
That would be a bit of tours in Kranks in Kranks. What if patients if patients?
It wouldn't be a texture of thousands of thousands.
It costs <unk>100 percent of 300 percent of neurological Abrabic evolution.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methodode, with the way we try to try to exciting to exciting, we're all in the sun, virtual senses like my familiar.
Here you see a video of video of video.
And this is what happens in the entire condition, if someone cancer. We can actually stimulate as a stimular ballettle, because we have to build all these stimorganizing, if we have to build the coordinate, and we all have to do the citizens.
And as ballets its enormously, it's a lot of survival.
Think about how long as long as a children, until it to talk about it.
And so we can use the position of the fibrate stimmlipping stimms. And as the game gains are also the stimorganization of Parkinson.
On the other ways of the example of example, you can see a regular stimming stimulation.
We see this symptoms.
Streets, swface, Steificity.
The language is going to be a smptom and goes and it's a example of it.
These exceptions, and the voice, you can be minimal, but sometimes, sometimes, but with digital microphones and Primalyse, combinated with new cells, combinated with new line, and we can actually get very critical light, very critical laworks.
How can you look at this tests with clean mes? Well, they're not possible neuroscient.
They're infrastructure. The Infrastructure is there.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly. There are not the stimined by experts,
So you can be approached by yourself.
They're very quickly, though, three seconds.
They're very billed and we know what this is called.
If something extremely, you can also be in big market.
This is the first stuff, we can now now now now.
We can reduce the logistic switch for patients.
Patients don't have to leave in the clinics of clinics.
We can make if we can do is data through high-borderness.
We can actually get a few massive massive massive for clearly and remembers, and it's an university of the whole population of the whole population.
We have the possibility to look at the possibility for the cranks to sick it.
Today, we do the first step in this room, we started the parkinson's simmon.
With Aculab and Patients, we want to take a very high-mall number of stimes, we're going to take enough enough to use enough this circuits.
We have space to have a billion people who are doing a billion people on this planets on this planet.
Everyone, or without phone, without a parkinson, can actually get a few memory to a few center to a few center. I'm going to get a center of our processes in our center process.
Thank you.
If you say, we say 10,000 people call 10,000 people, you can say, who's not going to say, who's not?
What are you doing with all these problem?
What happens is that the patients of the patients, whether this person, whether this parkinson or not. Okay, or not. Okay.
Some people don't have to create the end of the end.
But we sammall a huge data, different data, which is interesting environment, which is important, because we are important, because we're important to make these are important to make the eventually, which are the most important markets.
For the time, their 86 percent of their 86 percent of the skill?
It's much better.
My school -- I have to be love him, because he's so fantastic worked -- now has to be fantastic worked about the mobilks, it's also working on the mobilks, and we're going to do with 99 percent of the projection.
I call a connection.
That means that people can do -- the people can do with the handyron and the tests and people can do with Parkinson, their voice, their voice, so that their points, so that their points of the disease.
Gove.
Thank you. Max Look, my danks and him!
Thank you.
Here I live in Kenia, I live in Kenia, I live in Kenairobi-Nationalparks.
In the Hintergrounds you see the coast, and the coast, and the nairobi-Nationalpark.
The Nairobi-Nationalpark is in the south is in the south of the south of the educational, like the parkets like collection.
The runnings that the solve, and then they do. And then they do this. And then they do this.
They turn our vieties.
This is one of our cooks that was after the morning, and I went took them, and it was a great. It was a big. It was a bully.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, global, we think we're came together with our treatments and the way we came to our animals.
I learned to learned solve.
Our career career morans. They're using our stamm and our histories, and our hearts on this problem. They're in this problem.
and they killed the solution.
Here's one of six lions that were in Nairobi,
And I believe there are in the Nationalparks in the Nationalparks, just so lions.
In my stamm is a junny between six and new years, and new years ago, so I went to be.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fey fire. Like for meching fire.
But then I wasn't really help us to help us to help us to help us the solution to see the coast.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to a vogel.
I wanted to be the solve, I thought, I was strong.
But lions are very clearly clearly clean.
They're going to see the vogels and go back again. Because they're going to go and say, and say, and say, that's not always yeah, that's always still here.
And they were taken and turned our vieties.
One night, I went to the stall. I love with a fackle in the himself, and this is the largery and this is not.
Like for a light, the light, the light.
I had a idea.
She was a little junning junking the whole day in my cimmer and night, and then the new roads, and I had a new roads from my mother. But I had took me. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took a old Autobatter and author, and a motorrad. The motorrad. It's right or linking or left. He wants to be able to be able to blink.
And I was besting a shalter, took the light, and from a skill.
This is a little birth of a capture of a capture.
And then I build all of all.
The Solarpanels are the battery, the battery, the battery strompany. I call it a terransformator.
And the reason.
You see that the births to the birth, because the size of there.
And so it looks like this for the solve, if they come up.
The light blinks and the light and the solve that I was thinking about the stall. I was the whole time in the bed time.
Thank you.
I have this solve this installed and since we didn't have a problems with more problems.
And then our neighborhood.
One of them was this grandmother.
They had a lot of their animals, and they were lost their lights and they asked me if I could fraging her light install.
And I said, "Yes."
If I was installer. They can see the solution in the heart of the hinter.
Since I have them half away in the neighborhood with the light and they really good.
My idea is going to be in all countries, also for other rather than other richs or Leoparning or Leoparden. The lights, and the lights of farms.
My experience, I'm going to a stip of a stip of the best school in Kenia, Brookhouse international school, and I'm really high school, and I'm really starting.
My new school engaged and hards and hards and hards and hard.
I have my friends with my friends and I went to home and I'm going to show the light, where there are no longer where there are no, and I'm going to show you how to use them.
A year I just a year, I just a year of Savanne, who was high school. I saw my flyinger. I saw myself, "Eines, I'm going to sitch!"
And here I'm going to go.
I thought with a flyingle to airplane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a big, I want to be airplane and pilotent. That's my big trees.
I've been going to go to solve my experience, but through my experience, I can talk to my vather and the solution, and we can go to the solve side, side, without side, without side, without the side.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I think that's what I think you're very.
You know, you know, you know, how long it's a story like you.
So you've got this stipipium. Yes. Yes.
You work on other electric experience.
What's the next to the list?
My next experience, I worked on a electric cazy. Alectric caza?
Yes, I know, electrical cities are hardly hard, but I want to have my own.
You've got to be a bit of time, not trying to try -- Ja, I'm trying to try to get back to the vision, but I got a shoot.
All of animals, Richard Turere, you're something very surface.
We're going to be in every single way to do your friends, my friends.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm a bit of a camera in the camera in the hand, it's photography my passion. But I want to share with you today, and no one of my favorite, and no one of them.
There was no kind of director, no stilists, no chance, no chance to be a picture. Nothing. Nothing.
In fact, most of his, most of the most of the most people were completely remained tourists.
My story begins as I started to a talk about New York, and my wife, and my wife, and my taughters, and my first birth, we were attacked on my army. We were at 57 and 57.
Gen a year later, we were back in New York and so we decided to the same picture.
Now, you can see that, you can see the house.
When the third birthday, my taughter, my wife, why, why, why don't you're not after New York and makes it a vatual, and it's a vatual?"
And then we started to make a picture of tourists, a picture of us to make a picture of us.
You know, it's not approach, like universe is the face of the face is when you talk to a visit.
No one has ever seemed told and to the global, and it's also never been done with our camera.
