When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clench of the clench.
My father hearing on his little bit, gray, granddio, the news of the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual, because it was pretty unusual, because the news.
He called, "The Taliban are familiar!"
I didn't know what that meant was really happy, but it made my father, very happy.
"You can go to a right school," he said, he said," he said.
The morning I'm never forget.
All right school.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and they spent a girls, and they spent girls.
So I was sold, I five years long as a boy, and I started my older sister, my older sister who didn't go to a little bit more of school.
and so we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way, so that we could never get a different way, where we went to where we went.
We hidden our books in the books in the books so that it looked like this.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small wohnzimmer.
In the winter was, but in the summer, but in the summer was incredible.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
And then the remarkable of the difference, the box, because the taliban powerful for a week.
We were never safe, how much they knew about us.
Do they required us?
Where do they knew where we know where we're going to do?
We had anxiety, but we wanted to school.
I had lucky in a family to grow up in education as important as important and decided to be daughter.
My grandfather was his time.
At the outside of a provinced provinced Afghanistan. He's came up with his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and it was sended by his father.
My mother was borning mother, but teachers.
That's what they're.
Two years ago, they went to the rhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here was the first in his family, who was ever a school picture of a school education.
For him was clear that his kids would be a children, it would be a children, even his daughter, dead, dead, deades, deadly,
He looked like a much bigger risk of his children don't look at school.
I know that I'm sure that I was in the taliban, sometimes, and sometimes, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective loss.
I had good loss, I had to give you a father said, "They can lose your life. You can lose your life.
His money can be released. You can be done in war. You can be done in war.
But a thing that's going to be staying, and that's what's going on. And even if we have to pay with our blood for your blood for your school, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that was destroyed by the war.
Less than 6 percent of my age of my age of my age, a higher a higher board, and when my family, and when my family, and when my family, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm standing here, as a stolvent of the Middlebury College.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was came from his family, because he was sended to school because he was a grandchildren who was the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first.
He doesn't just talk to my high school, but also, I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman who was the first woman, and I'm the car.
My family believed.
I have great trees, but my family has greater trees for me.
So I'm global bothers for 1010, a global bottom of women.
So I've been helped to green, SOLA, and maybe some interfghanistan, and maybe some interfghanistan, a country, a country, a country,
It's wonderful to see how the students of my school with great leadership with great leaderships.
And to see how their parents and varians for them, like my parents, and I'm going to be able to do all the time and definitely all the time.
So as Ahmed. That's not his name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Approach a month, his daughter and he's on the home of SOLA in their village, and they're the death, and they're just about a few minutes.
When he got home, he came up with the phone and a voice, and a voice, he would be able to school, he would try to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "The gave me, if you want to be the future, but I'm not going to sit down the future of my daughters and overloads."
What Afghanistan, so I realized something that I realized something that's going to be able to do, most often, most of us who have a father that the success, and the success that the value of his daughter, and the expects.
That's not success today that our mothers don't play in our success.
Thank you are harder to be the ones who are involved in a lot of possible for a much promise of their daughters. But in a society like the infghanistan is the infghanistan is the infinite important.
On the Taliban went to school, just a few hundred girls -- because it was someone.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls,
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how we're looking at the changes.
I'm notice that the changes are not changed by the U.S. and they're changing the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school, and their parents that they're going to take a lot of themselves, and then I see a lot of promise that they're going to take a lot of future and a long-termanistan walls.
Afghanistan is for me to a country of hope and the uncomfortunities, and it remember every day, and I remember the girls, the SOLA.
And I think they have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, also, my life -- my life -- my life -- my life was done in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1977 -- I see, I'm slowly -- I'm in Sambia, Kenya, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria and Somalia, Algeria, and Somalia, and Somalia.
I worked for a Italian NRO, and every single project that we put on the legs that we put on the legs.
I was sent to do.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did all of what we did.
Our first project, which is what my first book "Ripples of the book," inspired inspired, one that we wanted to show the people who wanted to show how food is going to show how food is going to show you.
We came to Italian Saatgut in South ASambia; in this to sambia; we lead to the Sambesi flying the Sambesi flying the animic population and domata and Zucinian tomates and Zucini.
Of course, the answer was no interest inside the interest in this, so we paid them for the work, and sometimes they were doing it for the work.
We were amazing that there was no country in a so early talue.
But instead of wonder why they didn't look at the same, we just said, "God, we're here!"
"Govery-free to return the people to save the sambias,"
Of course, all wonderful in Africa.
We had these practices. In Italy, they were so big, they were so big, in Sambia so big.
We couldn't believe it and said, "Shouse, like simple country, like simple country."
When the tomates were red, and rotates about 200 nights about 200 nights and wondering all.
We said to the Sambiern: "Oh God, the Nilpferde!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a country."
"Why didn't say that?" "You've never asked us."
I thought, we were so greater in Africa, but then I saw what the American, but then I saw what the Americans made the Englands, which was made the Frenched, which I was data, I was quite statement in our project.
We felt the nest, the nilproducer.
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainty African people who have nothing African people.
They should be the book "Thead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyoyo.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have the African continent 1.5 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been telling you.
Let's just give you a book.
Les you know about an African who we have angered.
We're a western people are imperialists, missionary, and there's only two species, like we're patrize them or we're patriarchalic.
Both words, from the latinic woman, which means "Theather," which means "Vather" means.
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalic: I'm treating everyone else of another culture, they were like my children.
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone else of another culture, they were my services.
That's white people in Africa, people in Africa, Chef, called the Chef,
I was growing up when I was the book "Small Is Beautiful" by school, and he said, "The Go, everything in the economy when people don't want to go to the rhead.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is Respe.
Today, the morning of the heart of the conference, which is a stab on the ground, and asked, "Can you're not going to imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react on people, and he found a system called companies, and he never motivated something initiated with the never motivated, but you never motivated, but you're going to be available power of the person whole power of the pion that the power of the
What you do -- you're doing -- you're going to be the mouth.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're setting with the individuals.
We don't work from bure.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're meeting us in Kneips.
We don't have an infrastructure.
We finally foundation and find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to be.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can tell someone else.
If that person don't like this?
The passion for the own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own growth is the most important thing.
We help them to find the knowledge that can never be successful.
The person with the idea has not been able to know the knowledge, but it's compassion.
A lot of years ago, I had this instead of a community in a community and people say, why do we want to do why don't we hear them? But not in community.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
Compan have never been part of the public and they'll never say what they want to do with their money, what they want to see what they're seeing for opportunities.
Planation has this blind flex.
The coast people who knows the community, because they never create nobody.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, it has to be a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new records have to be created.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedroom, who's in your house, and in your cocketry, and in the coffe, you help you help you to find your passion to transform your passion in a way to transform your passion.
I have this in the food, West-Australia, trying to try to do this.
I promovated to the time and tried to get out of time and tried to get what they should do, where we should do other people to do.
And so I went through the first year, and I had the first year and I had the first customers, and I half the first customers, and I half, he was half, and I half, he was a restaurant in Perthi. I him.
I half these fishers, and I helped this wonderfish thunks, and I don't think about 60 cents<unk>Cent<unk>Kilo to Japanese center, but after Japanese for 15 dollars, and they said, "How dollars."
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government came to ask me to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I hold the mouth and highly high."
So -- -- so -- so the government, "Mach it again."
We've done it in 300 communities.
We've got 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be able to do this.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the best companies, story,
Peter pressure was philosophy professor, before he was businessor, before he said, Peter pressure, Peter pressure, Peter pressure, and the reality and the economy."
Planation is the deathescussion of the entrepreneurs.
So you build Christian to know what the clock of human christian Christian Christian and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these to get these to get to a bring.
You have to give them discretion and privacy, you have to help them to help them, and you have to help them, and they're going to get them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
What presentation have you expressed most application today?
<unk>respected people. The people have applications.
I want to say that company is that company is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- northern Brazil fossil fuels, fuels, and suddenly there are sustainable.
The confusional powerful thing is not sustainable.
The Freon-Artt the content is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we look at seven billion people on the sustainable ways to record them, today, transportation, and we can correspond to them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will that technology for the green revolution? Universities? Oursities?
The government? I mean, you know?
It's going to be invention. And they're going to do it now.
I'm a future story in a future of a future of many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were actually the einglements that were the future of New York in the city of New York in the year.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happens in 100 years, with the city of New York, the shadow was a unity: The city was a unity: The city wasn't exist in 100 years.
Why? You saw the curve, and they said, when the population in this tempoint in this tempoint, they needed six million pounds, and it would be impossible to people, and it would be impossible with the master of six millions of power.
Because they went to the master.
1860, they see the bad technology that life looks like New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, 19001, there were 1001 cars in the United States -- 1001.
The idea that I had a different technology, the running. It was made a little fabrics in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with companies.
And when he's got to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
On the first thing they don't come and talk to you.
So next thing you have to remote them, engaged and empty service.
Then you have to remember the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the little bit of the biggest company, all of the countage, three things: that needs to be selling product, that has to be able to sell the consumer that needs to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
Rather?
We never met a single person who can make a single person who can sell you a little bit of money.
That's not what it doesn't exist.
This person was born.
We've been looking at the 100 iconic companies of the world, and we looked at the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Ford the new companies, Google, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, yahoogle, yahoogle, yahoogle,
There's only one thing that allowed all of the world, allowed to have a sense of the world, just one person, just one person was just one person.
Now, we're going to take 16-year-old United States, and we begin to start the first two sides of Richard Branson Autobiography, and the first two side of Richard Branson Autobiography. The first one of the first side of the first side of the side of the first side of the
No one time and 32 times, and 32 times.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody basically, a company. No one company.
So can we create a community that we have a little bit of painting a little bitterground, in Caf<unk>s and Bars, and your engaged caf<unk>s and bars that they're going to do what someone who has done for those gentleman, which has done told you about this epower.
What can you? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you sell on the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't you." "Mo you're not going to finish?"
We activate generate communities.
We have groups of freedom that can be undergrounded by the companies that are supporting them to help them to help them. We've found that the wonderful population of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economy of the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be able to be alice in the wounderland.
The Penn State University bather, a Docentin for communication -- attacking engineering engineering in communication.
I had afraid.
It's not afraid of these students with their great brains and their great brain and their books and their books and their big books.
But as the conversation, it was developed to me like Alice, as they were going to look at the canninlocks and a door to a whole new world.
I felt like I felt when I was talking about the students with the students. I was amazing about the thought they had been discovered, and I wanted to discovered this wonder.
I think that to open this door to open this door, it means it's great communication.
We need to make unbed great communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineering the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that our biggest problems, like, for example, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't understand it, and if we don't know about it. I think it's not going to believe that it's important in our responsibility as a resp
But these great conversation doesn't come to understand our scientists and engineers and engineers don't in their wonder.
So scientists and engineers, bits us.
I want to show you a few answer, how you can see it, how you can see that the science and technology, and technology, and the technology, and the technology and span.
The first question that you have to answer is, and?
Says us, why we're just so relevantage is so relevant for us.
Says not just that their dracts are undergrounds, but also tells us that their dracts that their dracture in our bone, because they're important structure in our bone, because it's important to understand the Eastoporose.
And when you do that, what you do, what you do, then you're using forward.
Faching is a hinder of learning, for understanding.
Sure could you use their doctors and pretty much, but why doesn't say, "Raum and why don't you just understand what much understanding?
Our thoughts to make sure, is not the same as their name as their nive looks like their nive.
As an amazing thing said, "Macheaches the things that simple as possible -- but not easier."
You can tell us something about you, something about eye, you know, without knowing that compromise without the compromise.
A few things are there to be a couple of things: examples, stories and analogies, and analogies.
And if you're working on your work, then the story, then the story.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's called "Stunct"?
What happens when someone else? All right? A differently, and it's going to be able to do with these points.
A following as this is not just slowly, but also too much on the language of our brains, and we're going to be quickly, and we're fast.
These example of genevieve Brown is much we're much we're much effective. They showed that the special structure of the trabekel so stable to the inspiration for the inspiration for the only design of the effect of the effect of the effect.
The trick here is a single, a single sentence, just to use the audience, when it's audience, when it can lose the audience, orients, orients, and we can also relate our other senses and graphics, and they're doing a deeply distributionaring.
These are just a few answer that can help us to open this door, and the wonderful and the wonderful and technology in the science and technology in business.
And the engineers I've been stressed to me, I've been abused to make me" in me, I want to make all the contact with a memory, I want to make all of the same thing.
It's a moment of eurist stories and eurbed the rich piece of the relevantage, so that's important, and that's important, and multiplicated the whole thing about their own working with the people who are incredible working on it. And it's unbelieved. And itselfulously un
So scientists and engineers, if you have this equation, you know, clarifying me unbed me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy can you a cell phone in Syria,
With a handy can tweet a news and a protestail and a protestail.
And with a handy can take a song, you can take a song, it's going to be remained.
All of that is possible.
I'm a year 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people for change for changes on the streets and the streets.
We're in the historically in 1989, and we've been able to change the cell phone in the tasks.
Who is a handy has a handy?
Hold it high.
Hold your hand phone phone, you hold them!
Hold it up. Aroid, a blackberry, a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy talk about me and my handy, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 350 ciles of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U. Commission has a reliniety.
This is called the Rightlinie, the reliniety of reline.
This direction is that every telephone has to be part of the Europe, everyone in Europe, every Internetday, a bandbreaker in the entire carporate Europe,
Who is it going to be? Whoes a magail?
Who is a SMS?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years of your telephone, or your telephone or your Internetanbiety or your Internetanbield.
And everywhere in Europe, people are on Europe, and we said, "That's not going to be."
They said, we wanted to reach these ideas.
We want to be self-based in the digital time and we don't want to be the telephone and Internet, and we don't want to be talking about us.
There were an advice, Journalists, Preester, who all said, "That's want to say, "That's not going to."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of Berlin streets and said, "Freeity states."
And someone said, that might be able to state that could be to the stasi 2.0.
The state was the secrets of the secretchland.
And I asked me whether this really works.
Can you really all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone, I wondered my phone, the Germany that was the biggest telephone, and I asked them, and I asked her, and I asked them all information that they're all interformation about me.
And I asked them, and I asked them and I asked them and they didn't get a right answer.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is protocollated.
So I decided to make a definitely important to get a bit of it because I wanted to have this information.
But the definit telecom said no, no, we're going to give you this information.
At the end of it came to a compare with them.
I'm going back to the anclassion where they all send me all the information.
Because in the minute of the minute career relationships that the impact of the E.U..
So I'm going to take this half a college,
And on the CD was this.
35,830 ciles information.
First, I saw it and said to me, it's half a huge date. My date.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this dateift.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I start with this?
Because you see where I'm where I'm where I'm going to do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public information.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show you what was preventional prediction.
So with time open data City, and I've data City, so I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reincooms and rauscooms, you can pull back and back to the back.
You can make every step, because I do after that I do.
And you can see how I can see from Frankfurt with the stuff to close to close to close, and how many answer.
All of that is possible to this information.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First of all, it's just like, and I call my wife and she called me, and we talked me together.
And then I called a few friends and they call a couple of friends.
And after a while you and you call it and you call this huge communicationneticationnetication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they can go to apart time they go to bed a couple of time.
You can see all.
You can see the central figures, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect defect defection, how to make a society about who you know who you know who you're going to be a magail, who's possible when you have access to these information.
And these information are going to be security for months, in Europe to 2 years.
How I said, we said, we're going to imagine all these people in the streets in the streets in the history of 1989 Handys in their pocketry.
And the stasize of the state that was going to be in the demonstration of the state, and when the state of the state that would have been happening to be the leaders, then maybe that may never happened.
The case of the magazine magazine magazine.
And also, not the case of the ice of the ice.
Because today, because of the stategentures and companies like they want to get us about how they can get to war, online and often, online and often.
They want to be able to require our lives, and they want to be able to remember the long long long long long long long long.
But even self-bestimation and a life in the digital time,
But you have to fight for the self-based for the self-dime.
You have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you go home, you say that Privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you're going to go home your attention, just because companies have to have the opportunity to specifically, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think you're asking your phone, you've been talking about you've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you use your handy, you remember the self-bestiment in the digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoes, snellrestaurants, brights.
So the city planer doesn't meeting and overlegral South Central to change the name of something else, and it's changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituoes, snakes, snakes, brought bridge.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food South Central Los Angeles Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-thrus and the Drive-bys.
The comic is that the Drive-thrus more people killed than the Drive bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The fatheries in my fourth is crazy. B. B. Five times higher than about 15 kilometers, which is about 15 kilometers.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how you feel like you would have no access to healthy if you couldn't have access to healthy if you go out of the house, the negative effects that are the best expectations that have been looking at your fourth system.
I'm selling that rolets are buying and selling how we buy buying.
I see the dialysecentary small sugary as Starbucks.
And I realized that this has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no loss, I had no luster in 45 minutes to get a pesticy to get apple that doesn't have a pestician.
So I plant a food victims, I was a food.
It's a piece of country that we call Parklage.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is the thing that's the city.
But you have to start it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility and I have to hold it."
And I decided to keep it.
So I came up and my group, the L.A. Green reason, and we started together, and we started to plant my food, and open, soon, and open, so that all the program, so that all the program.
We're a kind of a kind of a group, together, together all social stories and all the city, and it's free, and it's freewilled, and everything we do is costless.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else.
The city came up to me and he told me and he told me a practical imagination and said that I have to be a huge, and I had to be a richeral record.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A richeral anticipation of food, food is a piece of food, which is really good for you totally?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herman."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times, Wind, Wind Lopez Lopez, and I spoke a story about it and talked to the city and talked to a member of Green Bound. They were reason, and they were in Change.
We hold the hands.
My city rather rather than that she said they're supporting it, and they love what we do.
So why should they do that?
LA. He's in the United States most of the city of the city of the city of the city.
They're bringing 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flower to plant 725 million tomates.
Why would they find that the television?
And by the a plant of a plant, you get 1,000 sames.
With green bohs in the value of a dollars, you're own value of 75 dollars.
It's my home, I say, I say that they should be building their own food.
His own food is like his own money is like his own money.
Look, I have a conversation in South Central.
I went to you. I have my sons. I have my sons.
And I'm sure that part of this previous reality to be part of the other people who were fabricated by other people, and I fabricians my own reality.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Graffiti covery artists, the walls, the walls, I'm going to beautiful, I'm going to beautiful.
I use the gardens that the Earth, like a piece of piece, and the plants are my relationships for these stuff.
They would be surprised what the Earth can use it as a country when you use it as a country.
You can't imagine how it's amazing a sunlume is, and how they make people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden to an instrument for the relationship and the relationship.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wonderful as kids are going to be confluenced.
Garden is the therapistic and coastic and coolest act, especially, especially with the city.
And then you get the expression.
I remember this time when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30 tots. They were looking at my garden, and I came out.
I've been simply feeling, because they were there, and I said, "Well, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I went told me when I saw people looked at people who were so close to me and I was just asked me to do it, and I said, "Fin, people asked me, "Fin, you don't have angry.
And I said, "There's no, no, I don't know what they're not angry.
And it's about the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it back to the same time to take their health."
And I was a different time I was a garden in this observed in Downtown L.A.
These are the guy who have helped me to decided to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how it has been confluenced with their mother and how they've done with her mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed it was a moment.
Green reason is so basically about 20 gardens.
To our environments came up with our environments, and they're all freedom and they're all freedom.
If kids carbon, they eat children.
If they cut them, they eat, they eat.
But if they don't get anything about it when they don't get together, how food and body eating and body eating them, they're blind whatever you're always eating them.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work, but they're standing in this thing -- I see, I see exactly the same children who are exactly on the path, and the next children who are never going to be awhere.
The gardens, I see a opportunity where we can train these kids can train themselves to care their communities to care their communities.
And if we do that, who know who know who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carver Bring.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Edbots, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole wanted to be a whole bunch of popular bubble in the same block.
I want to take schoolscontainer and they're using it in healthy.
So, don't understand me.
I don't talk about costless snow, because the costless is not sustainable.
The comication is that you have to behavior,
I'm talking about people, people working to help kids from the streets, and they're going to leave the streets and the streets, and the honor, and when you look at your own food, and if you build your own food.
So what I want to do here is to do here.
I want to be able to all the ecological rebellire, Gangster, Gangster.
We have to make the picture of Gangsters.
If you don't have a gangster.
You're going to sell you about the sell, right?
And let's make the weapons.
If you want to meet meet you want to make meet meet when you want to make meeting in the cool and make a meeting and make a meeting, where you want to do anything about what you're talking about it.
If you want to make meet meet you're going to get your garden, so we can sell any signs to be able to plant.
Face. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No infinite politicians."
Although in 19th century, a newspaper a better definition, "It's Snollygoster is someone who is someone who is a bit of parent, which is an independent of parent, program or line, and his success, and his regular power.
I have no idea what "spracheral."
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians, they need to try to control the language.
For example, for example, the British Parlament, the British Parlament, time, time,
And that was actually back to the mother's going back to the mutual names with the extraordinary names Brass Crosby who was crosby who was on the parlament.
She was him in Tower of London and launched him, but he was mutig enough to be enough to be enough to reach enough, and he was so much supporting in London, he was so much support.
And just a few years later, we find the first next message for the first message, like Brass."
Brasses are in English word for bad.
But that's not true. It's not going back to a return to a press.
But to show you how words and politics are politics, I want to take you to the United States, when they're just reached the unknown.
You saw the question of what you should call George Washington, the state of Washington,
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a republic nation?
And that's been in Kongress in Congress.
And there were all sorts of things that are all kinds of possible proposition.
I mean, some people wanted to call it Gouvernor Washington called Worge Washington, and others, and others, and others, and others of the United States of America, which is whatton.
Not so a couple of a couple of thing.
Some people wanted to call it a nice cow.
They thought that's while.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the kingle time.
It would have been working.
But everyone was indeed, because this debate, because this debate 3 weeks,
I have the days of a senators who are still going to be significant, "Immermerging the same is the same is the same is the same issue.
The reason for the population and the long movement was that the representative,
The representants didn't want to be what's going to do. They wanted to do it.
Canig nice, and they're going to bring it up to ideas.
They wanted to him the most powerful, young, the most painful title that they give them a little bit.
This title was "President."
President. They didn't existed the title. He existed. But he was suffered that someone was a familiar with a tribe.
That's how the idea of a Jury.
He had no longer than the reason, as the record of "Auffer."
Sometimes, there were president little colonial communities and government groups, but it was really an unbedexpected title.
That's why the senating him.
They said, "That's lowerful, you can't call it President.
This close together, and that has to make signs and out of the citizens.
Who gets him, if he's going to take a thumbs like President of the United States of America?"
And also after 3 weeks, the senat, not after three weeks.
Instead of the course of the title of the title of the middle of the markets, but they wanted to create the cells that they were not available to their own rest of their own rest of the methods and methods.
You can learn three interesting things.
First, and the final I've been able to find out if the senatism, whether the senates of the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just been just reflective. He was just about it.
Secondly, you can learn that when a government says that something temporary -- then you were 223 years later, you were 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is the Titels, the United States of America," is not so clearly the United States, right?
This has been able to do something more than 5,000 nuclear power, and the greatest volcolcs of the world and the greatest volcolces and a flotts.
It's really a story and story of the title of the title.
And so the senat at the end of the end.
They have a respectable title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of sense of the ownity -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the cerling with the 5,000 nuclear limits with the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the senat and the representat and the representative because nobody is never felt that you're going to be the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take me and I decided to do with.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality to control the reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, but actually changed the reality of the reality of the reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelling campaign for a campaign for a 19-year-old, four-year-old surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'd like took my black coverse Halboose Halboose a pairs and celebrate a rocket in region of government, which I couldn't even see once.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was written with war, and I went to the war, and I was a new pyjama Partys and Football playing with rassistic southern South Astairs and religion career.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm asked here, I'm born, South Afghane, Southeists God's Godesnaden, and a radical politized artists who had next nine years in Afghanistan, and I worked in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do is a lot of good things that you couldn't make a personality, but I don't like to make art. I want to make art, and I want to make the personality and cars and cars.
I want to spend a day in life of a vihad -- Gangsters who spend his dihads, like <unk>Popstar Bling, and I'm going to be religious and political career and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's going to make the Dihad gangster, as a parlament to candidate a choice and make a choice, and I'm going to do with the Slogan: I'm going to do."
And try to use these campaign to use these moafiosiosiosiosiosiosi.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and I walked to the reason, and I called the reason, and you're going to be a wrong control of the streets of cabular cabular streets and cars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan of my mind, I wonflict, and I wonflict.
The war and the war and the free of the free of the free that came together with him, and a new environment for style and models that you can only make a model of the collection for skills and self-orthe-footh-orthe-fellowing.
And I would like to see how a simple ship of Kabul between Kabul between Kipling Appell, to create appell of 18999, today, and that the process of their women's created their wildren in the past,
But for all of these things you can get in prison, they can be missed, they can be missed, missing missed.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to be lost the geography of self.
That's my favorite?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I work as a model.
Since 10 years, right?
I have the feeling that now is now in the room, I would have an infinite spanning this clothes, because I wouldn't have to stop this clothes.
Fortunately, I have something for a way to do something for this.
This is the first time that someone on the TED book on TED book, so you can see, so you can see, so you can see.
If you were really explored, when I was really explored when I found out that I don't need to say that I'm not going to say that.
I also realized that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds, which I can change what you think about 10 seconds.
There's no chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I wanted to send them.
The worst part is hardest part of my head is to pullover my head, because then you'll all be able to do anything, so long as long as head.
In order.
Why did I do that now?
That was possible.
Well, it wasn't so picture as this image.
One is a powerful, but a voice is also operating.
I just have a changed your opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photograph, I told my back and I told my back in the hair, and with my hair in the hair.
And then from operations or the wrong bridge, which I was two days ago, and there are two days for the work that I have two days of our own opportunities, and our own questions, and our own life -- even though it's own life -- even influence is a great life.
For means to be hotting me today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I asked on this stage because I'm a hill, because I'm a woman, and in my branch, and in my branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh," but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, is a model, and maybe a mattery and maybe you're asking what's going to ask you, and maybe what's going on.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not just beauty and young and young and young and young and young, we're biological programmed, but also, even hospital, but also hospital.
This experience was created for me. And it's a same for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Joan Smalls. Liu.
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to be aware of your model.
But I have to tell you that in 2007, that in 2007, a very large in 2007, the NYU.
The next question that I've always been going to be a model, "Can I'm a model, if I'm a model?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to give these little girls that I want to give you approach?
You know what? You can be? You can be everything.
You can be president of the U.S. or the inventor of the next Internet or a ninja-Herzchirurg Dichterin, which is greater, because then you would be the first."
If they still saying, "No, no, no, no, no, Cameron, I want to say, "Who," I want to say, "Who's my head."
Because I don't have a responsibility for the Chefredacted the American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next side of H<unk>amp;Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model, it's like you're going to say that you want to tell the Jackpotto the lotto.
You can't be able to confluence and it's not a career.
Now, I want to give you 10 years ago, because of the constrate knowledge, because other than harders, because it can only be just folks.
If there's a photographer, and the light, and the light, and the centuries, and the century, and the cameron, and then we want to go to the legs, and then you go to the legs, and then you go to the poor, and then you go to the arm.
It looks like this.
Hopefully more communicately than that.
That was ... I don't know what's going on.
If you look at school, and you have a life, and a couple jobs, you can't tell you that you can't say that you can't say that you want to be a lot of the U.S., but in life, you'll be able to look at the United States, and then you'll go together.
The next question that I'm often saying, "Who's talking about all photos?"
And yes, so pretty much all the photos are retuss, but that's just a little part of the story.
That's the first photo, which I made this, and that was also the first time I was also the first time I had a biciniode. I hadn't even my periode.
I know that's going to be pretty personally, but I was a young girls.
So I just saw a few months ago, with my grandmother.
This is me on the day of this shooting.
My friend, my friend had to start.
This is me on a pyjama Party, a few days before a Shooting for the French vogue.
This is me with the football-Team and in the V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
It's constructs and it's construction of a group of profis, from Ha Stylists and Make-up artists and photographers and stylists and stylists and the production.
Okay, when next thing, people ask me, "Well, you're always going to be?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-cm-cm-Absatching I never met approach, but the things I can get bigger, things I've ever getting in the real life that I don't like to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, and one day, I went to a laden and I had my money, and you gave me the cleid forget.
When I found my friends with my friend, a farm, and they were a fully bicycle and of course, and of course, we had a redress, and of course, and we could only have a choice, and we could further.
I have this cost of my costs, I don't get my exception and not because of my personality and there are people who are people who are paying their extraction and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last decades, and I filmed, 85 percent of the latinos and latinos and latinos and latinos and most young men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men are not asking the question, and Latinos, "Who I'm going to ask the question?"
And so, "How often I'm going to turn? When I'm going to pay attention?"
And I found my rights for this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers, and these numbers are 178 percent when they're 178 percent,
The last question of me, "How is it, how does it be a model?"
And I think they expect them, they expected this answer: "If you're a little bit and believe you're harm, you feel very happy and felt very happy and fabulous and fabulous.
And we give a answer that maybe we might have this impression.
We say, "It's really great to report so much to report, and it's greative, inspired people."
All of that's true, but it's just the half of the story, because what we never say, "I never say, what I never said, "I feel the camera, I've never been saying, "I feeling me."
And I feel like me, because I have to think about my exciting every day.
And if you ask you ever ask, "Where I be happy if I think you'd be happy, and believe you?"
Then you should meet a few models, because they have the thinest boxes and the most final harm and the coolest harm and the coolest coolest coolest women on the planet.
When I wasn't approached me to tell me, it's very difficult to create a real piece of a side, because I felt very uncomfortable, and I felt very uncomfortable to say, "I'm all the idea of my grandforests." And I was going to believe it.
It was very difficult to be a hard to a single bad and reason while I was a biggest nutrition when I'm one of the greatest nutrition of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm sured, and I'm going to stand up here, and I've been here, and I've been here before 10 or 30 years before 10 or 30 years ago, and my career, because I wouldn't be available, because I wouldn't be able told me.
If you take a little bit of this talk, then hopefully that we all recognize the power of the image and mistakes more empower.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother, which is, "Son," is, "Son, list of the exilience of the mind.
But who never never been to something like a gaddafi revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the libysche revolution is broken by the waves of the waves of the waves of the waves of the massive revolution.
I spent a lot of other libyers, with a lot of other libyers, and I was also a day of the Zorn, to start a day of the corn and to start a revolution of the tyrannian Regime Gaffis.
And there was a big revolution.
Junge, liby women and men are stood in the first rest of the first rest of the regimes, hold slogans of the regime, and social generality, and social generality.
They have an example of mutes, by using the brutal dictature of the brutal dictature Gaddafis.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the farmers, from the farmers, until the west.
Finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 toes, and almost 50,000 tyran and the guyran and the guyranians.
But Gaddafi has a big big big business, a citizens of the Tyrannei, the basically for course.
Four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannian Regime, the infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The challenge and the challenge and the challenges, I asked how many other women, I as many other women, the civil society lybia, and we added a bestimate and national experiences and national experiences.
So to 200 organizations were during and unmediately after the case of Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in the exil, I got back to Lybia, and I started to Lybia, I started to the topicshopshopshopshopshopshops and leadershops and leadership and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I women's the peaceplatform Libyscher women, a movement of women, a movement of women, and the goal of life, the goal of the counterps.
I met the payments I met a very difficult environment, a small environment, which is always stronger politics. A environment, and the egoistic politics of dominance and exploitics.
I was a sitiative of peace and available force, and I women to reach available choice, and I think that every business, and that every bit of the citizens, egal memory, and to country and care about all the rights and country and care for all the rights.
And at the end, our initiative, and he successful.
Women women 17,5 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But long, but it's sure the eyphory of the eye of the whole revolution to new news, we waiting for news.
One morning, we went to the money, we went to change the money and Sufi-Grands.
In another morning, we got news about the morning of American bothers and the angry.
At another morning, the morning of officients of the army.
And really, we're going to grow up under the milize of milize and their own milize the people and their opportunities and their power and laws.
Our society, we found that we've been revolutionary, polarized by the ideal and decided by the ideal and principles, social, social generality, social generality, social generality,
Intolerance, expluse, and Rache, and Rache, the Iconced the economy.
I'm not here today today today with the success story of our remote, and the choice listen and the choice.
For example, I'm here today, as a nation that we have a nation that we've made a nation and the wrong choice.
We've been sentence our priorities.
Because the choice, the choice or security or security or security in Lybia.
Hat the rivers lists lists and the white between female and men, and menal wars and national female versional female similary?
No, it didn't.
What's it?
Why is our society is going to continue our society and dominated by self-f-fired politics of the dominance and the extraordinary, and the women?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been taken the female women's female values of the middle of the middle of the middle.
Our society needs a national demonsens, and consensuming the choice as they brought the choice, which has just the end of the polarization and decision and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative conversation of the female, more than they need the numeric, quantitative confusion of the female.
We need to stop in the name of the name of the name of the roache and a day of the roach.
We need to start to act on the name of the compassion and the grandchildren.
We have to develop a female developing the following words, but also, it wouldn't just too, but also together, instead of collaboratory, collaboratory, conclusion, approach.
These are the ideal that has a completely crisism lybia to make peacebia to make peace.
Because the peace has an alchemic and in this alchemics, and it's about the femines and masculines.
This is the real remarkable river.
And we have to existence existence, before we do it sociopolitically.
After a versus from the Koran "Salam" -- Freece" -- Freeks, "What's the words."
The word "raged" against the in all the abrahamic traditional traditional, this is the same as the word "srabic word "mbolized the word "mbolized the word "mbolized the whole mankinds to the whole humanity and the whole pathway from the whole management of
And just like the motherleible of the Embryo, which is completely so nutrition of the middle of the compassion of the compassion of the middle of the entire existence.
That's why used told us, "My Gnade all things."
That's why used told us, "My Gnade, I've been previous."
More us all the art of the gunst of the grandmother.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country, and I went to the best of the world, and I went to bring the low.
And I was very proud.
In school, we looked at the story of Kim Il-Sion, but we learned a lot about the world, except that America, South America, South Korea and Japanese are.
And even though I often asked me how the eyework is, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until away.
and for seven years, I saw a public he looked at the first time, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had never had to live.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter of warf with the Swestter of a collegin.
Darin stood, "If you're going to be read our family members not being on this world, because we've been for two weeks.
We're going to collapse our bodies and our body are soon as well as well as well as well ask."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time, I heard that people in my country.
I went to the bahnhof, and I saw something that I couldn't look at something that I can't get anymore.
A living woman woman on the ground, and a abushed child in their arm, and a half of his arm.
But no one was half of them because all of them were so carefully to care their families, and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big change in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreaner's falling for the open, and many more than they were just because they're bas, because they're bas, and basically,
In the case, the more and more half after that, so that's been covered me everything, except the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the environment.
I always asked me why they had there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors.
This is the river of Amrocc <unk> <unk>, the part of the Morder Korea and China and China and China.
As you can see, the river of the rivers are very similar to be very similar north Koreaners.
But many songs.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't tell you how I left North Korea, but I can say that I can tell you that I could say that I was during the hunger,
I thought I was sitting for a short time from my family.
I never thought that it was 14 years to give me a 4 years together.
In China, it was very hard to live without girls without family.
I had no idea of how life would be as a north Korean flying, but I would be extremely successfully, but I realized that it's not just extremely hard. Becore, because north Korean Fles are being in China.
So I lived in state, Identity that my reality could be involved in a case, and you would be a terrible sentence.
One day, my greater alptraum, when I was asked by Chinese police, and in the Chinese police and in the police.
Someone who was really important to be north Koreanerinese core, so they kept my chinese countries and asked me to tell me.
I had so language, I thought I thought my heart.
Would anything that, indeed, I could be sort of course, I could be embrace.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I felt it, but I felt my feeling my feelings and answered the questions.
After they were finished with the excited, a camp, "That was a research.
It's not North Korean."
And they love me. It was a wonderful.
Some North Korean, in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and repeating.
These girls had great happiness.
And even though they were expected, they were free, they were free international pressure international pressure.
This North Koreanerins didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, unless north Koreaner in China, and after North Korea, where they're followed, either, either history or public.
I hadn't happinessed with my flight, it's a lot of other north Koreaners didn't like that.
It's tragic that North Koreanerans, and they have to fight and hard to care about survival.
And so they've learned a new language and worked in a moment, their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the past 10 years, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
Mich in South Korea, was a bigger challenge, a bigger challenge, when I thought it was thought.
English was so important in South Korea, I had to learn my third language.
And I have the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all coreaner, but inside our inner, we've been very expecting us from 67 years of the participation.
Identity crisis.
Bin I south or North Koreanerin?
Where are I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no land more, I could have a country that my home.
And even though I didn't work on the southern Akorean life, I had a plan.
I'm ready for the attention of the university.
And so I went to my new life, I was a hard life, I was a bad struggle.
The north Korean body, the money I found my family, and when I was sent my family was sending my family between place to apply place on the country.
They had to fast as possible as possible, so I started to plan.
North Koreanerans have to be an incredible strangers to their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to acrosss between North Korea, Ironically took airplane, Ironically went back to China and made me back to China and I went to China.
Because my family doesn't have to talk to them more than 2,000 miles, I had to southern Asia and then after Southeast Asia.
The businesses a week, and we've been expecting more matter.
Once again, when the business was a Chinese police.
He took the exactly of all and started asking questions.
And my family didn't understood, I thought they would be able to get them.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided told him that she was decided to him, and I said that they were taught her approach their attention.
He looked at measured me, but happy, he was happy.
We created it to the laotic border, but I had to be almost all my money to borders to border the border of Laos.
But even after we had the borders of the border, my family inhaft, because illegal green.
After I had money and snowered my family, my family was inside a month, but I was free in the month, my family, my family repeated in the mainstad of Laos.
This was one of the biggest rid of my life.
I had done all of my family to free my family, and we were so close to the family, but my family was just carefully, just the southore of the South Korean Bothanish Bothorean Both.
I went back and I went to the individual and the police and the police, and I tried to family, but I didn't have enough money, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man who is "What's losing?"
I was fully surprised that a friend of it.
In broken English and with a words and with a word book, I went to a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and they went to a bankomat, and two more north Korean, and two more northern Coreaner,
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he said, "I don't help you.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The first thing that needed free models for me to a new hope for me to a new hope that needed to take the North Koreaneran, and he showed me the friends and the support of friends and the support of foreigning the northern Coreman.
Finally, after our long journey, my family, and I remember, but the freedom, but the freedom.
Many North Koreanerans are done by their families, and soon as they go to a new country, they're not going to get a money or not a money or not a money.
The international community can help us in education, the English, who are the mountains and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the eye, because many of us in contact with families, and we're staying them information and we send them information and money, and we're harming to change the northerna.
I had a happiness, so much hard to get so much hope that I hope that I hope that I hope to successful northern Coreanistan with international success.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful North Koreanerans, also, in the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a bit.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
I want to imagine my bridge.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't talk to you, but he's communicated friends, like some of the best reder.
Remi knows what love is love.
He shared them, and he shared it increased.
He's not just gone. He's not on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences and imagine it: He never tell you, he never tell you a light.
If he singled out of our childhood, you're trying to remember the words that I remember one thing: how little bit about the understanding of what we know about the consciousness.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. It's very good.
He's an absolutely unfailable memory.
But he has a selective.
He can't remember if he did my snowledge, but he remember the public, but he remember the public, and he was reminded by my iPod, as he was four, as he was four, as fourthy of the most public boxes.
Do they don't think about it?
But many people don't stimulate.
And in fact, because their understanding of the society of normal pash, they're often, they're often, and they're often.
But what my heart was taken and my soul, and my soul, even though this was that the case, even though it wasn't a similar to be a similar to be a similar to mean that they were extraordinary -- extraordinary.
Now, for the young people who don't ask the path of you who are not as autism, it's a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, and sometimes the social communication, and sometimes, sometimes.
It's also the same thing about every individual, it's remium is so different than Sam.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person autism, and even though it's one of the most fastest growth, there's one of the world, there's no known as well.
And I can't remember the first time I remember autism, but I can't remember a day without any day without it.
I was born three years old when my brother when my brother, and I was so excited that I was so excited that I had a new words in my life.
And after a few months ago, he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and in fact, and in fact,
Remi lived and regulated in his own world, with his own world, and he found found found found in the smallest thing about the little bits, like, Autos in a series in a series of what machine is to eating it.
And when he was older, he was different, and the differences were simply different.
But then the woods and the wood and the fun and the funny little hyperactivity was something really a single, a remarkable nature, a junny and until the world without a junk, a boy, a human beings, a human being.
Exceptional.
Now, I can't learn that there was some family moments in my family, moments, moments, I wish I wished that they were exactly like me.
But I go back to the thoughts to the idea that they've led me to think about individuality, communication and love, communication and love that these things I don't want to be able to do that.
Normality about beauty that beauty that we're giving us, and the fact that we're different, and the fact that we're not that one of us.
It means that there's another way of responsible.
And if I just have a thing to Remi, and then I could say that you're not going to be normal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have -- we have a story! Jedered by us, and in all of us have a stranger, and in all earliers, and in all of the ultimative open-limative open-focial.
The chance on the size, Fortune, and the walls in the moment where we try to be trying to be different.
Please -- you're not saying that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has led us with editor and neurosed to this photo on the project of a project, and with a project of just a million times a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and see the world, and see the world, but a million or a billion pictures per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography that femto-Fotography, a new education that's so fast, that they can record it's time in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the absolutely look at edits to look at edits or no beautiful body in our body, and really, really, and really, really, what we can ask with "Kamera."
Now, if I'm going to take a laser piece of a millionth of seconds, and they're more female -- that's more femtoseconds -- I'm a packet of Photon, and this is a billion-point, and this is a millimeter.
So if you take this project, this photones Photon packeton package, and it's going to be out in this photons in the river?
How does light look like light?
So, this whole events.
So, think of that, the whole event, the whole eventually, less than a nanosecond -- so light needs to return this stranger -- but I'm lighting this video to the factor 10 billion of this video to the factor of the light.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed.
So, in this movie, so much, so let me show you what's going on.
The puls, our projectile, our project, a photonpaket a photonpaketer package, and it's hidden, and that's finally inside.
A part of the lights outside the table, and you see this expression of the waves.
Many of the photons of photons, the last last last last, and exploding the rivers and exploding in different directions.
As you can see, there's air bubble that's in the flash.
As you know, while the waves are broad on the table, and because of the reflexions of the reflexions of the reflexions of the focussion of the focuss.
Now, if you take a piece of projectily and it's the same streets back to the video back to the factor 10 billion people, you know, how long you have to see how long you have to see the film?
All day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long-term -- from a long-term -- from a long-term, normal project.
And how does it look like a stillle photography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like when you have a sense of a teach.
I'm going to look like this, as a photo males, the nature of a femto-B movie, but of course, of course, our eyes.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that when the light, you'll see that if the lights, that's going to remain this further. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the tomate is reifying and the light in their lights and after a million seconds.
So, in the future, if these femto-camera in your camera in your camera, it might be able to be able to make a supermarket, and if you can go to a free, whether it's a frog.
So how did my team at MIT this camera?
So, as a photographer, if you're a photographic recently, you have very little light light light, but we've been a billion times faster than your citizens, so you get a billion times as good as good as good as well.
So we're doing this project, we send this project, this photones, and we show them the photones and recording to very cleverer synchronization and we've combinate this female, and we've combinate these female models.
And we can take all these rows and make all these rhdates and so interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hells can make us important, but how would it be able to see a new soul of superhelming souls, to see ecks?
The idea is that we're going to street a door.
It's going to go back to the room, a part of it, a part of it, and then reflects back to the door, and we could reflect these more simplic actors.
And that's not science fiction. We've built it.
Links, you see our femto-camera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to leave the door.
After our application in the Nature Communication," was published by nature, it was created by nature.communication, and they have this animation.
We're going to be able to recipe, and they're going to be able to do this poton, and then we're going to be able to reach the puppets, and some of the photons that will be reached to the light and then reach the puppet.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our fastera has some single camera has some single camera.
It's a very good time, and she can look at the world in light.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the first objects, but we don't know what the point of the point.
Indeed a laser on the bottom, we can see a row, we can see a robot, and how they see on the screen -- not really sense of these images, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they try together and try together, and they're going to try to make avash-balling to
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit of doing this, we can use the lab, and we can use the practice, we could build collisions that we can use collisions and recognize what's going to look at the collisions of the course of lights.
But because of the blood and website is very, of course, that's why the really bigger for scientists, so that's really a way to think about femto-footography photography, because a new conversation of medical definitation of medication.
So, how we can do this, and we can't have a scientist, and we can't have a scientists, and we can't have a artist, and I realized that all of the ultraphytes that all these genigabytes that we don't just know the science of data.
But it's happening here.
If you look at these waves under the waves, you see that the waves are moving the waves of us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turned out that we've almost in light in light, because we've seen the effects and astone effects have been seen incredible.
The range of the range, in the world in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, so it's going to be able to relationships, so by relationship with space and time, we can correct the relationships.
So, whether we should be able to create the editors, or the medicine, and we've got to remove the medicine or new data, we all have data and data, we allowed to ourselves and data and we can allow us to open up the way to open up.
It's about time. Thank you. Thank you.
There are many ways of our opportunities, how our lives.
We don't make any neighbors on the street, so many ways, so many ways, but we're using the same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and trying to share things like aircle, snails and create crosss.
The projects from my questions, how much maybe my questions, how much might be my neighbors?
How can we stop more things, without us, without us?
How can we remember our memories and leave the country and the country?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so that our communities, so that our communities and tears?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea levels will be report by the huge equipment that has been hundreds of years, bedrooms, bedrooms and tears, and I'm using a city, and I'm going to be able to music.
I think every time, every time, anyone nobody never, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the world, most of the city.
I'm in the number of this house, and I've been able to change it. I thought I was going to change my life for everyone that my life for everyone.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
Your name was Joan and she was like a mother for me. You suddenly suddenly and unexpected.
I've been thinking about death, and I spent a big death for my life, and I brought me to my life, and I brought me in life.
But it's hard to me, these views, these views.
It's easy to lose in the eye, and together what really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I went to a side of the house of the house of house and wrote a huge tafeles, and I wrote the lucky, I want to take a bit of the crowd, and I want to take a piece of cover,
I wasn't sure what I was expecting on the experiment, but I was the next day, the next day, and they were always filled and they're always wall.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the walls.
"Bevor I want to be sured piratricians."
"Bevor I want to sure you, I want to stand up the International datums."
"Bevor I want to single for millions."
"Bevor I want to sure a tree, I want to plant."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netzunting."
"Bevor I want to sure them again, I want to hold them in my arms."
"Bevor I want to be sure I want to be someone."
"Bevor I want to be sure I want to be very simple."
This is a sense of place, and it became a sense of place, and the hope and the hope of people brought me to the wine and dreams me to the wine and during me while the hard time.
It's about knowing that you don't know that you don't alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and understanding and we're looking at a new way.
It's about publication and remember, and for the news and remember what we're doing is important, and we grow and change ourselves.
I've done this last year, and I've made a hundreds of people who wanted to build a wallowledge, and I wanted to build my colleagues and I have a building, and now I've been building away in the world like Kaches, South Africa, South Africa, South A
We've been used to be as much powerful places when we have the opportunity to share our voices, and more with other people.
Two of the most valuable things we have time and the relationships, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with taking conditions is important than ever before, things that are important to think about the right bubble and think that life is course and think that life is course.
We're often deathed to talk about death, or even to think about death or even just thinking about it, but I realized that the idea that the idea of death is one of the death is the most stronger.
The idea of death, the death is using the death.
Our collective places, and we showed us what we're doing as individuals and as an individuals and more important. And with more opportunities, and stories can't help us to help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm suggesting with me, I'm a particular problem for everyone who are concerned with each other, which is that we're considered to be as companies.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to tell you the trial today, to tell you what I do.
Tancing is one of the most activities.
We're decided to be approach of most of users and soups, and we're going to see how you see.
For extraordinary a very extraordinary big magnitude and abilities, and possibilities, and possible evention that could have a genetic components.
Trazy new structurological stories like Parkinson long-lowing these extraordinary ability. It makes them to be in my ballettuism.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the mistakes.
And yet, there's a world's 6.3 million people who are living in this disease, and they have to be able to live with the unhealthymptoms like symptoms, and other live the disease, and others have to be able to do that.
We have to measure the research is objective, and last, and finally, really, really, really, really, really, if we have a projective massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive markets.
<unk>rather is that there's no parkinson and other movements don't have biomarkers, so you can't just biomarkers. That's what it's the best thing that we can do is this 20-minutes.
You have to put it in clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very expensive, extraordinary studies will never be done.
But what if patients could do these tests to make these tests?
That would be a hard tour in the hospital tours. What if patients could make these test themselves?
It wouldn't be a teures hospital.
It costs 300 percent, 300 percent, in the neurological approach.
So I want to tell you a unkonventional methods, with the idea that we're trying to reach the senses. Because we all are, because we all are, in a sense of my boy.
Here you see a video of video of video.
This is happening in the entire condition when someone language. We can look at our stimul ballettles, because we have to look at all of these voice, because we have to coordinate all these voice, and we all have to make the gene.
And as Ballet, it's enormous about it.
Think about how long a child, like a child, until it.
And by the loud of the position of vibrating vibrating vibrating. And as the grandma, and as the stimmorgane of Parkinson.
On the other attention, you can see an example of unregular voice,
We see the same symptoms.
Voice, swallow, sister, swall.
The language is so easier with the time and it's an example of this.
And these effects that can be minimal, sometimes, sometimes, but sometimes, sometimes, and presentize the presence of microphone, combined with new laware, combined with new learning, and now we can move with new learning.
How can these tests with clinical messages? Well, they're not both-invasive. The tests of neurologists.
They're not small. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly the voice is not going to be the voice.
So you can be constantly by the way.
They're very quickly, you're going to have 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also use it in great massive.
And this amazing quite sort of reaching this.
We can reduce logistic skills for patients.
Patients don't have to leave a routine control of clinics.
We can recognized data through half approach.
We can make a serious massroomization for clinical studies and first a studies of the whole population of all the population of the population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for biomarkers for the disease.
Today, we're doing the first step in this direction, we start the parkinson's sative.
With Aculab and patients LikeMeeeech, we want to take a very high number of voices to bring enough exciting enough to the exciting of these goals.
We have rotate rots that dreived a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, or without Parkinson, can be recorded to record a few center to a few center to a couple center. I've been known for a couple of our goal is just eight hours of our goal.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people, you can tell you who're going to say who isn't it?
What do you do with all these problems?
What's happened is that the patients have to give you approaching whether this parkinson't. Okay.
Some of them may not be able to create it.
But we collect a huge database, different database, undergrounding, which is interesting. These are important, because we're important, because we're involved in order to make the real marker.
At the time you have 86 percent of their 86 percent device?
It's much better.
My snaker Thanasis -- I have to love him because he's so fantastic works -- now has gone -- now has been working about the mobile phone, which is also working on the mobile physically, and we're at 99 percent.
That's what I call a responsibility.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handy on the handy, and people can do with Parkinson could take their voice, their voice, so that you can take their doctor, so that you can take the research.
Good.
Thank you. Max Little, my dadies and gentlemen!
Thank you.
Here's live in Kenya at Cenyairobi Nairobi Nairobi National Parks.
In the background, you see the kitchen of my father and the kitchen is the nairobi nairobi national Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the south of just in the south. That means that Wildtire, which means that wildlife as cebras the park every single time.
The regular, the solution, the solution, and then they do this.
They killed our vieties.
This is one of our kitchen that was killed. I watched. I watched it. It was great. It was a great box. It was our only box.
My stamm, the stamm of the Massai, we think we're going together with our animals and the website of the sky. That's why we came up with our animals.
I learned as a children.
Our warrior warrior, and they're protect our stamm and our hearts. They're also brought our hearts.
and kill the solution.
Here's one of six solution that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a nairobi- National Park, just so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so fe
In my stamm is a boy between six years, and new years for the kitchen for the kitchen. So it was also a little bit of his father.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Lions. Lions for mechanism.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to see the solution to see the kitchen better.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a bird.
I wanted to think the solution I thought I was still a new next to the cow.
But solve are very clearly clean.
They come to see the birds and go back. Because the next time. But they're going to come and say, "Well, that's not yes, that's still not yes.
And they're taking our vieties.
One night, I watched the stall. I love with a fackel in the hand around him and this time, and that time.
Lions for me, light, the light that moves.
I had an idea.
I was a little boy boy, I worked all day in my room, and I took a new room, and I took the new radio of my mother. And I had a lot about electronics. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took a old car, and I took a car, and I'm going to show you whether you're right or left, whether you want to read or left. He's blind.
And I best words to me a switch to the light and out of a switch.
This is a little birth of a captain task grandpe.
And then I built everything.
The solar panels are the battery that battery, the battery, I call it the direction of the direction.
And the direction of the direction.
You see that the births, because of the birth, because of the solution.
And so it looks like the solution when they come from the solution.
The lights blink and the solution I believe that I was about the stall.
Thank you.
I have this home installed us to home and since we didn't have a problems.
And then our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and they asked me whether I could ask her the lights installing her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
I've seven houses, I've seven houses in the neighborhood, and they really good.
My idea is used to be used in all Kenya, also for other robtians like Hyenarden or Leoparden. The lights. The lights of farms.
My experience to me a stipending me to a stipendium in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited to be international school, and I'm really excited to be international school, and I'm really starting to be in Cenyaventional Schoolside.
My new schools are engaged and helps themselves through language and recording.
I even have my friends with my friends with home and I've been using the lights, we don't have the lights where there are no, and I'm going to show them how to use them.
I just a year ago, a boy from the Savanne, who was hoping his flying. I saw airplane, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a sit."
And here's where I'm going to stand.
I thought I was in airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm great, I want to be airplaney and pilot. That's my great traum.
From the river, I can go through my experience, but by my father, I can retave the cows and the solution of my father, and we can live without the side, without the solution, without the lions without strangers.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language means that I'm very much.
You know, you don't know how long you're not to hear a story like yourself.
So you've got this stipendium. Yes.
You work on other electrical supports.
What's the next on the list?
My next experience, I'm working on an electrical country. Aemaun. Aem?
Yes, I know, electrical cases are already long, but I want to found my own.
You've already trying to try to try to try to give you a little bit, but I've been trying to give you a snow.
All the beginning is hard. Richard Turere, you're a little bit of special.
We're going to be able to make your way to help your friends, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm old enough to hold a camera in the hand, is photography my passion, but I want to share with you 15 of my favorite, and no one of my favorite.
There was no kind of director, no style, no chance, no chance to be a picture. Not even the picture.
Tourists to be able to be able to be able to be able to do a vehicle tourists.
My story begins when I was a talking for a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, I made my daughter, and we were on my arm. We were on my arm. We were on the Eckeep five.
And so, we were later, we were back in New York and so we decided to be a same picture.
Well, you can see what you can see.
When the third birthday, my daughter said, "Hey, why, why, why don't you sabina, and you don't get a father a father to New York and make it a father?"
And then we started to build a picture of tourists, we started to make a picture of us.
You know, it's notice, like universe, as universe is when you're a completely freezing friends.
Nobody has ever said, someone has never been lucky, and fortunately, someone with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rises of our lives.
This journey is very hard today.
This is only after the 11th, September 11, and I had to explain what happened in the day, which was happening on the day.
These images are much more than just a financed moment, or a particular journey.
They're also for us to be a week for a week in the october, and how we change our time and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical but in all of us.
Because even though we do that, we're doing our perspective of mal. While they're always new miles, and as they're always seeing new miles, and how they see it with all around the life with all of them.
These very intense, which we spend together with each other, and every year we expect that we've expecting every year.
Last, while one of our rises, we went to a sudden, and suddenly, and suddenly, they showed them how they're going to show them a red market on a red market, they were learned as a little kid, when they love to love to be a little kid.
And she told me about their feelings that they had five-year-olds that she had been exactly the same thing.
She said they remember how their hearts from the heart of the breast, when she saw the laden, for the first time they saw the first time.
And now they looked at New York after High school because they want to study in New York.
And I realized, I realized, the most important thing we all created, memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you to share a active role in the world's most expectations of memories.
I don't know how it looks like this, but I'm going to look at this 15 images, I'm on a family.
I'm always the picture.
I want to tell you about today today with you today, and I don't want to ask someone to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
