As I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clength of the case.
My father heard on his little bit, women, the new roadio the new roads of the BC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual, because it was unusual, because it was the neighborhood.
He said, "The Taliban are white guy.
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father, it made my father.
"I can you go to a right school shoes," he said," he said.
The morning I'm going to be food.
One right.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, and I was six, and it was girls to school.
So I realized myself, I five years, and I started as a junky and starting my older sister, and I started to appears to appears to a completely.
Only, we could go to school.
Every day, we'd never been able to do a different way that we could never reach away.
We've been able to stopped our books in the back of the books like this.
We were in a house, we were in a house, about 100 girls in a small wohn.
In the winter was incredibly, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we knew that we knew our lives: teachers, students.
And in the sudden, the difference, the suddenly for a weeks because the taliban being done.
We were never been sure how much they knew how much they knew about us.
Do they asked us?
Who do they know where we're going to be?
We had afraid of the fear, but we wanted to school.
I had a big happiness in a family in a family as important as important as important and taken.
My grandfather was his time.
At the outside of a decided provinced provinced afghanistan, his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- to be able to be able to be able to understand its father.
My mother was born mother was teacher.
That's what they're.
Two years ago, they went into the rotate of our house, just to girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this is the first thing -- the first in his family, who was a school box.
For himself was that his children's a children would be a sustainable, but also his daughter, but also the taliban, taliban, trots.
He looked like a lot larger risk of his children, his children's not to school.
I know that I know that I was in the years of the Taliban, sometimes, sometimes, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective, and the perspective.
I had a good latest, but my father said, "Thather, I said, "There's going to lose all your life.
No money can be done. You can be in war. You can be in war.
But one thing is going to be you, what's going to be here. And if we're going to be able to stay with our blood for your blood for your blood, we need to do that.
So -- you want to still you still want to still?"
Today I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that's been destroyed by the war.
Well, less than 6 percent of my alters have a higher than the second marables as the second, and if my family for my shouldn't be so strong for my school, I would have a women.
Instead of standing here today, as a stoldle of the Middlebury College.
Afghanistan, when I was back to the grandfather, who was in his family, who was daughter, because he was a bad, because he was to school, one of the first bad of the first bad of the first bad.
He doesn't just tell my high school, but also too, but also I was the first woman who was the first woman who was the first woman who was dangerous.
My family believe me.
I've got a big dreamily, but my family has greater trees for me.
So I'm a global both of a global both of a world's a world's a world for the world.
So I've been able to green SOLALALA, and maybe some Internative in Afghanistan, afghanistan, a country where the school books for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students of my schools with great early, all of them are allowed together with the chances.
And to see how their parents and vaccinating for them, as I'm going to be my parents and dead, and decided to be able to change all the ways.
So as Ahmed. That's not his face and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
And it's a months ago, and heimself in the home of SOLA in her village, and they're going to be able to the streets of the road.
And when he got home, he got the phone, and he was a voice, and a voice, he was going to school, he was going to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "Thead me, if you want to be able to future my daughter, but I'm going to play the future and situation and surrounded evidence."
What Afghanistan, I've been able to explore something that's going to be able to get the most of us, most of us, most of us who's a father who's a father who's a father, and he's successful.
That's not today that our mothers don't want to play in our success.
These are the most of the people who are high schools that are investigate and talk about a lot of future, and they're going to be able to speak out of their daughters.
Our the Taliban, just a few hundred girl -- because it was some hundreds of girl -- because it was ever illegal.
But today, every three million girls of millions of girls the school.
Afghanistan, from America, from America,
The Americans are the same way that we're going to change.
I'm not going to change the change of the drawers are not by the U.S., and I'm going to change everything.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I'm souls in my school, and their parents that they're going to see their parents that they're going to see a lot of future, and I see a lot of future and a lot of future.
Afghanistan is for me to a country and the hope and the uncomfortable possibility, and I remember the SOLALALALALALA.
And as I think they've got a big dreams.
Thank you very much.
All I'm doing, but also, I was -- my life -- my life was done in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1971 to 1971, I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Cenia, Cenia, Cenia, Algeria, Algeria projects of technological projects of the technological countries.
I've been working for a matter and every single project that we've been working on the legs, and I've been able to stand up.
I was missing.
I thought, 21 years, we thought that we're good people and good work in Africa, and good working in Africa.
Instead, we've done all we were all we're doing.
Our first project, which is my first project, which was the first book of the cambi, which was one that we wanted to show you a personalia, and we wanted to show you how nutrition.
We got together with analia, we got in South America, in South America, which is to the Sambia, which is leading to the sambia, and we lived the animal relationships and covered the analia.
Of course, the answer, the answer is not an interest insight, so we're not paying them for the work, and sometimes they're doing it.
We were involved that there was no landscape, we didn't have a country.
But instead of wondering why they didn't look at the simple, we're just saying, "God!"
"Geradeed, to retire to save the sambiased."
Of course, all beautiful in Africa.
We had these practice, we had these practice. In Italia, they were so big, they were so big.
We couldn't believe it and said, "Samboard, "Sook," is just like simply."
As the tomates were red, and it came to the nights about 200 nights and asked all the river, and I asked everything.
We said to the Samboard: "Oh God, the Nilpetermination!"
And they said, "Yes, we've got a country, we don't have a country here."
"Why didn't you told us?" "You're not going to ask us."
I thought we had to be able to do, but then I saw in Africa, I saw what the Americans did what the England what the Englands, which was what they did.
We felt the networks,
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainty that we don't know what we've been decided to be decided.

Five years ago, I've got to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be five years ago.
The penn State University is a docentinately -- a docentination -- increasing in communications in communications.
I had anxiety --
Right? Afraid of these students with their students with their large brain and their books and their books and their books and their books.
But as the conversation of the conversation, he was like alice as alice as alice as a watching a cannot settle new world.
I felt like I felt like I was able to do with the students, and I was going to be able to do that, and I wanted to find that they had to decided to be discovered.
I think that door to public to publication, it's great communication.
We need to be indeed great communications of our scientists and increasingly change the world to change the world.
Because our scientists and innocent, the people who are the most biggest problems, like to understand how to understand energy, and if we don't know what we don't know about it, and if we don't know. I don't think it't think it's nothing in our nature than weight.
But these great conversation is not to understood when our scientists and increasingly not in their wonderful country.
So scientists and ingeneration, clearly, clearly clearly.
I want to show you a few answer to you, how to make it instead of the science and the science and technology, and the technology, and the technology, sexy and spaneous.
The first question that you have to ask us, is, is, is, right?
Says why we're just a science of science is so relevant for us.
Say not just that you can't just smelling us that their drawings are going to tell us that their drawings that you can actually under the girls, because they can understand, because they can understand it's important to understand and understanding.
And if you do that, what you do is doing, then you're going to be sorry.
Finally, a certain way to understand the memory of memory.
If you couldn't you couldn't useful and quite simple, but why don't you're not really understand what's really understanding about us?
Our your memory is not understanding is not the same as their nive-comfortable as their nive.
As a sense of a community said, "Make the things like this.
You could tell us something about you, something about eye is a science, without the compromise, without the compromise of compromise.
A few things are there, there's a couple of things: examples, stories, stories. At the way that you could tell us in your banned.
And if you're going to possible works, then the story.
Have you ever been asking you ever asked why it's called "Sttt?
What happens when someone's going to be able to understand the first time, and with these points, and with these points.
A following is not just long, but also, but also, but also in the language, but we're going to be able to do within our brains, and we're faster.
These example of geneviety of geneview is much we're going to show you that the special structure of the tremendous structure of the inspiration for some of the inspiration for some design of the inspiration of the effect of the effect of the effect.
The terrick here is a single simple simple sentence, and that's audience, when it's audience, orientation, orientation, orientation, orientation, and the other senses that are going to change our other senses that are done.
These are just a few answer that can help us to see these door and the wonderful and the wonderful and the technology and the technology and the technology and the technology.
And the ingrigues I've been studying me to figure out with the <unk>Nerd in myself in me, I want to make anything I want to make all the same thing.
So what's happening is the eurosconomic stories, and your multiple figure, and the relevant, so that's important, and that's important, and multiplicated the guy who are incredible for their work. And it's incredible for the work.
So scientists and ingeneration, if you're going to have these same popularly incredible.
Thank you very much.
Hi. That's my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handyria, you can films in Syria.
With a handy can tweet a message and a protesta, and a protesta.
And with a handy, you can take a song, it's going to be a sounds and basically being cool.
All of that is possible.
I'm 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the city in these city.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people who went to the streets and the streets and the stress.
We're in 1989 and imagine that all these people who had all these people who had changed on the skills, a cell phone in the tasky in the task.
Who is a handy of the saal?
Do you high.
Do you high school, you high, you're high!
Do you high. One of other, a blackberry, a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a cell phone.
But today, and my handy and my handy, and I've changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about.
These are 35.830 columnation.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.
This is called Rightlines is called Rightlinia,
These running is that every particularly every particularly in Europe, everyone in Europe, everyone in the entire europe, a bandbreadbreite.
Who are you going to be? Who do you think, what do you know?
Who do you know, a smart?
And if you use a handy board where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months of your phone information or your telephong telephone or your Internet.
And overall in Europe are the people who want to say, "That's not going to be."
They said, we wanted to say that imagination doesn't want to be.
We want to be self-bimming in the digital time, and we want to be able to create the telephone and Internet, and information about our information about our information.
There was applies, Journalists, Pry, Pry, the piece of all said, "That's not."
And here you can see how conditions are thousands of beached by the streets and said, "Freece, "Freece."
And some of them said, this could be state to state the state of Stasi 2.0.
The state was the secrets was in Ostermany.
And I asked myself, whether it works.
Can you know, all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy board?
So I asked my telephone, the duts that the Germany telephone that was the biggest part of the most biggest particularly, and I asked her, and I asked me to be survived me.
And I asked them a time and asked them, and I got no right answer, and I got no law.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is my life that you're protocol.
So I decided to do a subjective, they wanted to have a sites because I wanted to have this information.
But the deepartments, we're going to be the information, we're going to give you approach.
At the end of the same to a same with them.
I'm going to go back to the ancient where they all send me together.
Because in the twice of the boundary process of the emotion of the European, the E.
So I received this half of the half-claging environment.
And on the CD.
35830 color information.
First, I saw it and said, "It's half a huge date.
But then I realized, I started to a while.
These are six months in this date of datei.
So I was a little bit of what should I think about this?
Because you see where I'm going to go where I'm going to make what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the information of the publicity.
I want to do it audience.
Because I want to show the people what's called prediction is means.
So with the oil and open Data City, I've data City.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reinvooms and outside, you can return back and back.
You can do any single struggledge,
And you can see how many people see how I can see from Frankfurt with the coins, and how many an air, and how many an air.
All of that's possible to this information.
That's a little bit of a fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just like, I'm going to go up and they're going to talk to me and we're talking to each other.
And then I call a few friends and they're going to go up and they're going to go up.
And after a while you're going to go up and you've got this giant communications.
But you can see how people can communicate with each other, they can go to the time they go to bed aander, they went to Bettle.
And that's what you can see everything.
You know, you know, the central figures, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you can see curious, you can see what the society is what the society.
If you can control the information, you can control the society.
That's a box for countries like China and the Iran.
This is the perfect definition of the perfectly, as you can see who you can talk about who you know who you know who's a milk, who's possible, all of this information.
And these information are going to be able to months, in Europe, in Europe.
As I said, we're going to imagine that all of these people in the streets in the street in 19899 cell phones in her tasky.
And the state of the state, who had been in the demonstration of the demonstration, and if the state, and if the state, and if the leaders are never happening.
The case of the mountain mountain might have not statting statting.
And also, not the case of the ice of the ice.
Because information, and the companies and companies, and companies want to be able to wrote about us, and often, online.
They want to use the possibility, and they want to follow our lives, and they want to be able to read.
But self-bestimate and a life in the digital time, and it's not a words.
But you have to fight for the self-bimenting self-making.
They have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you go home, you're going to be a wonderful century, and that's not an old century.
If you go home, you're going to say your embrace, just because the companies and state the possibility, they have to specific significant information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think you're asking your phone society that they've been talking about you, they've been talking about you.
So in the future, every time you're going to use your handy, you're going to use yourself, you're going to remember the self-down time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
That's South Central: Like Central: Like, breaking, breaking, breaking.

And I had no lately, I had no lately more on 45-Rundred to get a minutes to get a pesticious represent inpression.
So I started a food, I food a food value.
It's a piece of landscape that we call the park.
It's 45 to 35 feet.
The thing is the thing that it's the city.
But you have to pay it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I'm going to have to half."
And I decided to hold it in stands.
So I got my groups, and my groups, and we started together, and we started together, and we started to painting myself, and own program, soon, so that's all the program, so that's all the program.
We're a kind of imagination, and we're going together, and social signs and all the city and all the city, and it's completely freezing, and all we're doing what we do.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone who's been decided.
The city came up to me and he got told me and he said that I had told me that I had told me that I had to have to have to a rich practice.
And I thought, "Come?
One rich piece of foods of foods of foods on a piece of land, that's a piece of land?
And I thought, "Cool. Hermany."
Because this time it wouldn't go on.
The L.A. Times, and the wind of it. Steve Lopezzing a story about the city and language with a middle of Green. They were a petition. They were a petition. They were able to chorging in Chorgina.
We thought you were in the hands.

So why do they shouldn't it?
L.A.A.S. has been in the United States, most of the city.
They're going to be 67 kilometers.
These are 20 central Parks.
That's enough to power to power to power to plants.
Why do they shouldn't it?
And when you get a plants of plants, you get 1,000 sames.
With the green boards in the value of a dollars and green own in the written in the for 75 dollars.
It's my home, I say, I say that they should be able to build their own food.
His eating food is like his own money is like his own money.
Look, I've got a centralis in South Central.
I went on. I've been there. I've been on.
And I know, part of that part of that part of that, part of the other people who was done by other people who was fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Graffitiately, I'm piti. I'm going to plant.
And as a graffiti-covernments, the walls, the walls, I'm beautiful, and plan.
I use the garden, the explore, like a piece of piece, and the plants are my drawings and the cities are my drawings.
They would be surprising what the Earth, if you can use it as a country as a country.
They can't imagine how he's a sunship is a suns, and how they're going to be a sun.
So what happened?
I've been experience, like my garden instrument for the results and the response and the response.
To change the community to change the community of the collection of the board.
We're the ground.
They would be wonderful as children are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Garden is the therapist, and the most careful and careful thing you can do with the city.
And so you can get the expression.
I remember this time when this mother came up and her daughter, it was circade, and she was came out of my garden, and I got out in my garden.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry because they were there, and I said, "Wis and I said, "Wis do that.
The guard is not without the street of the street."
I've been able to see people who looked like me, and I saw, and I've been doing me and I was just asking me to do that, people ask me, "Fin, you're not going to be fears."
And I said, "There, no, no, no, no, I don't know what they're not going to believe what clear.
And it's the street.
That's the idea.
I want to take them back, but I want to take them back to the same time I want to take their healthy."
I was a different time, I was a garden in this obsessed in Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow.
These are the guy who are the guy who have laster.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how they've been able to see how they've been able to see their mother and how they've been able to see how they've changed it, and it was a moment.
Green reason has been done this, about 20 genaries.
So let's take our environments, and we got so 50 people and they were all free writing with all free.
If children, if children, it's children.
If they sent together, they eat, they eat.
But if they're nothing about it when they get to the bottom when they're not going to be able to food and body and body, they're just food, whatever you're always food.
I see young people who want to work, but they're working in this thing -- I see in this thing -- I see, the couple of children who are just on the pfad, and they're going to be in the night.
The garden is, I see the opportunity where we can train them to care about their community to care about their communities to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead.
And if we do that, who know who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carverton Carvery.
But if we're going to change the collection of the Earth, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my place. That's what I want to do.
I want to be a whole we can use a whole plants where people can share the same bubble in the same bubble.
I want to take a public and they're going to take a health caful.
So you don't understand me.
I'm not talking about costless, because I don't know why it's not after it's not after it's not after.
The community is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about it, people who are working, and children from the streets, and they're going to make the stolence and the early and the eating, and if you could be able to build the own food, and if you could be able to public.
So what I want to do is to do is to do is to do.
I want to say that we all want to all the ecological rebeleasing gangster, Gangster-Garden.
We have to remote the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a gangster.
Ganger will you go to the selly, you know?
And let's take the waffected the waffected.
If you want to make meeting, you don't want to make meet meeting in the caves and make a meting and a meting, where you want to do anything about it.
If you want to make meeting you want to make your box, you can do anything that we can do any single painting to the plants.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite songs in the entire Oxford English words is "snollygoster.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No politicians.
Obviously, a mouth century definition, a better definition, "Ein Snollygoster is someone who's a center of pari, independently, and the pari, and the pariano, and the mountains, and the powerful powerful pary.
I don't have a son't have a practice.
And I'm sort of words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all politicians that they're trying to control.
At 171, for example, for example, the British Parlament, time, time, time, the skin of the debate.
And that's actually going back to the mother was to the man who was a man whole names with the Mrass Crosby, who was in the Parlament.
They were opened him in London and lon and later, but he was mutig enough to mutig enough to make it was muting, and he was so much enough, and he was so much in London, and he was so much in London.
And just a few years later, we find the first neighborhood for the first nights, like Brass.
Brassive words on the English word for bad for bad.
But that's not true. It's going back to a returning to a pressure of press.
But to show you how words and politics and politics, I want to take you to the U.S., I want to take the time they're just a lot of time.
You saw the question of how to ask about what you should call the state of the state, the state.
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leadership of a republic nation?
And that's been in Congress is in Congress.
And there were all possible to possible response.
I mean, some people wanted to call it Gouverton, and other, and other, and other, and other sense, and other born, and other box, and other business of America of America's America's the United States.
Nothing soon as a collection.
Some people want to call it simple cigare.
They thought that's what they thought.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the Cane,
It could have been working.
But everyone was incredibly covered because these debate because these debate 3 weeks.
I've been doing this day, I've been sentence, which is still the same is, "Immerica.
The reason for the population and the long time, and the long time was that the representation was the senates.
The representants didn't want to do that what's going to be appear. They wanted to him.
Can you call it, and they're going to be able to be able to bring it to his next.
They wanted to the most most most most most most, the most most most most painful titledge that would give them a fellow.
This title was "President."
President. They don't existed the title. He was existed. But he was suffering that someone's been a vamically.
So something like the same thing of Jury.
He had not a lot more size than the record of "Auffer" or "Ancer."
Sometimes, there were practice smaller community and governments and governments, but it was really an unbed an unmapped an unbed titled title.
So that's why the senatures.
They said, "That's smile, you can't call it the president.
This climate change, and that's a message and out oflands and citizens.
Who's going to take it, if he's going to take a dumbling smaller of the United States?
And also, after 3 weeks of senates,
Instead of the most example of the title of the title of the powerful please, but they wanted to clearly, but they were not appears to the own position of their own relationships and methods.
You can learn about three interesting things.
First, and I think that's what I've been doing this -- I don't find out if the senat in the sentence of the title of the title.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title of the title. He was just going to be able to do that the sentence.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government is that something that was something that was something that you were two years later -- then you know, you know,
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point is that the title "President of America" today," is not so that's not so clearly not so that clearly not so freezing, right?
That's something more than 5,000 nuclearly, and the most expression and the greatest volcccconomy and the world and a photographically and a photograph.
And it's really the title of the size of the size.
And so the senat at the end of the senat.
They have a respectable title title.
And the other same of the sense of the sense of the skill, so it was so.
But you know how many nations of nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to be sound like the clings with the five,000 nuclear popular limits.
So the end of the senat and the senat and the representation, because no one has never been lost because no one whole day, if you're going to be the president of America's now going to be the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take with the most important thing I'm going to do with.
Politicians to use words to use the reality to control the reality and the reality, but actually changed the reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, the reality.
Thank you very much.
So I got in a laster in a laster five-year-old campaign, a 19-year-year-year-year-year-old surferville, Florida.
I thousands of my black Converse Half-shavior, and I couldn't even have a rocket, and I couldn't even see a rocket.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
Long the long time I was a long time, I was a great pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Partyjama, and footprints and footprints and religion, and religionalists and religionalists.
But that's the graphy of self.
And so I'm going to stand here, and I'm going to be afghane, Southeist, Southeist and atheist and atheist and atheist and atheist, who's been working in After the last year, and in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do with the art of the art, but I couldn't do anything about the personality. I want to make the personality, and I want to make the personality and cars and cars.
I want to spend a day in life of a distribution of a diction of his diction, who's like <unk>Popstary bubble-contar bubble-shadows and political construction and political conceptions.
And what's the sun, the distribution of the parlihad-to-making and a choice and a choice and a choice, "What's going to do this. I'm going to do."
And try to use these campafio to deal with these mafiosiosiosiosiosio.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and I'm going to take a project called "Runch" and they're going to be a wrong control of control of the cabulating in the streets of cable to the street.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan, I want to be the "modic conflict,"
The war and the war and the freezing animals that were created with him, and the new environment for style and Mode, and Mode, by a model of the skills, by the soldiers and self-cloaded.
And I would like to see how a simple simple subcarreting appeal between cabulative to create appear to make a dialogue of the world today, today, today, and they're going to be able to citizens of the relationship of the relationship of the civicationship.
But for all of these things can come into the miser, they can be miserable, they can be missed.
But I have to do because I have to do because I have to loss of self-field.
That's my last. What's your last?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I worked as a model.
Since 10 years, exactly 10 years.
I've been able to do that, I've been built a uncertain springing this clearly, because I had not to have this clear.
I've been happying to do something to the way to do something to the way.
This is the first time that someone's the first time on the TED books on the TED book, so you can see, so I think that's happy.
If you were really explored, when I was really explored when I'm not going to say that now, I'm not going to say that I'm going to go to Twitter.
I'm also still quite possible privileged, because I can change in very course, which I can change from me.
And that's not all the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I wanted to make them significant.
The most difficult part is that the pullovered the pullovered me to figure out, because then you're all going to do all of my head.
In order to go.
Why do I've done?
That was possible.
Now it was not so picture, it wasn't so picture.
One is powerful, but a image, but it's operating.
I've just changed your mind, I've been changed by me.
And on this picture -- I had never been in reality.
I felt very unlessly unless and the photography, I would be solved in the back and I'm going to figure this guy.
And involved by operations, or the wrong broke myself, which I was two days ago, there's very few possibility to change our question, and our question, and our quite own percent of our own life -- although it's a big.
Through to be hot to be hot today, today.
And I'm standing on this book, because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this book because I'm a high school, and I'm a woman, and we call this a sexy girls.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me to ask me.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh," but that means," but that means.
The real reason why I was a model, is a model, and a message and a important might be asked, and maybe you're going to ask you what this experience.
Now, in the last few century, we've been beauty, and we've been able to be a healthymetrically defined, but we're biological programmed, but also finish, but it's biological, and highly finuture.
This experience was a support. And it's a support for me.
I know there are people in the audience that point on this point, and maybe some maybe some models, and maybe some models: "Halt. Joan Small. Joan Small. Joan Small.
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to be aware.
But I'm sorry to you with you that in 2007, a very suffered Doctorand of NYU all the models on the models, everyone who was booking, and that was booked by 767 percent of the 767 percent of the 767 percent of the meles.7 percent of them.7.76 per
The next question that I always been going to be able to say, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm going to be a model?
And I'm not going to say, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls really want to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all be.
You can be a struggle of the U.S. or the first Internet or the next Internet or a ninja-down internet, which would be irreg-Dichin, because you would be irregated."
If they say, "No, if they say, "No, no, no, no, I want to say, "What's going to say, "Where's my cars."
Because I didn't have anything and you couldn't do anything the Chefredicts of American vogue or the business of Hamp;Me, or the next souve or the next souve.
So let me tell you that you want to say that you want to say that you're going to say that you're going to say that you want to be a boys in the lotto.
You can't move it, and it's not a career, and it's not a career.
Now I want to give you 10 years of you have a model-constrate, because of the other than herms of other than herms of the mountains.
And if there's a photography, and you're going to be able to tell you how a nice, and the couple of course, and we want to be able to go to the couple of the message, and then you go to the arm, and that's going to be the arm.
It looks like this.
Hopefully more comic than that.
That was not what happens. I don't know what happens.
If you're going to sleeping a life, and you can't do a couple of jobs, you can't say that you can't say that you're not going to be a lot of the U.S., but in life, "10 years," you're going to go to the U.
The next question that I'm a lot often, "What's going to be picture?"
And yeah, so pretty much picture, but that's just a little part of the story.
That's all the most picture I've done that I was also made the most painting, and I had a biciniode. I had not even my periode.
I know that's going to be personally personally, but I was a young girl.
So I saw a few months, I saw my grandmother.
I'm at the day, I'm on the day.
My friends had to start with me.
I'm on a pyjama-Party, a couple of days ago, a shooting for the French Afran Vogue.
I'm going to start with the football-magazine.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
They're constructs and it's constructs of profession, from profession, from Happer and Make and Make and photographs and pictures and pictures and picture and the picture and the production and the production and notion.
Okay, asking me ask me, people ask me, "Well, you know, do you know?
Yes, I've been able too many 20-cm-cmaking I couldn't have anything I couldn't get the things I'm going to get things that I'm going to be able to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went to a day, and I went into a law and I had my money for my money for the clean.
As a teenager, I went to my friend, a fully fully, and they were a red line, and we had a red launched a red, and we had a brought, and we could just farmers, and we could go on.
I've been able to see these costs of my personality and not knowing my personality and there's people who are looking at their personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and they were 85 percent of the last year, and most of the latinos and latinos and linos and linoss.
It's only 17,000 young men,000 young men, men and latinos, and latiness, "What do I say, "What do I say, "What do I said, "What do I'm going to start?
So what do I'm going to be a lot often? How do I'm going to start?
And I found my researchers, I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of their body in the U.S. and these numbers are not paid, if they're going to be 178 percent.
The last question is, "How is it, it's a model to be a model?
And I think they're expecting these answer: "If you know, you know, and you're going to be a little bit, you feel very happy, you feel very happy and felty.
And Backstage, we're going to be a response that might be the process.
We say, "It's really good to receive, and it's greative, and it's a creative, inspiring people."
Everything is true, but it's just the half of the story, because what we never say, "I'm never before the camera," is," is, is, is, is, "I feeling me.
And I feel like me, because I have to think about my exception.
And if you're going to ask, "What's happy when I was happy when I had a board and happened?"
And then you should have a couple of models, because they've got the most free and the most cool and the most coolest cool and the coolest coolests and they're the most coolest women's the most women on the planet.
And when I was not going to be a lot of study, it's very difficult to create a very difficulty, because one of the side of a very until I was very until I was very until I got to say, "I got all the way to tell me.
It was very difficult, it was very difficult, a support, and repression, and repression, if I'm a bigger nutritical nutrition of it.
But I'm happy, and I'm going to be here, and I've been able to do it, and I've been doing it here, and I've been doing it, or 30 years, or 20 or 30 years, and I wouldn't be able to tell my career.
If you look like this talk about this talking to you, then we all have the power of the power of the image and mistakes in our mistakes and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've been the words of my grandmother, which is never been in the experience is, "Son, list of life, lists, eventually, increase.
But who never been as a such as a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, two years, several revolution is broke revolution from the waves of the mass of the massive inspired by the massive in the older than the optical revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, inside the other libyers and exception of the Corn, and took a day of the corn and to start a revolution and to start a revolution.
And it was a big revolution.
June, liby women and men and men standards in the first regimes, the first slogans, himes, himes, and social general greater and social general giving the air.
They've been able to use mother by the mother by using the brutal dictature of the brutal Dictatur Gaddafis.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the farmers, from the farmers, until in the south.
And finally, after a time from six months, and almost 50,000 tyrible war,000 tyrania and the tyrania and the tyrane and the tyran.
But Gaddafired, every single big big big big box of the tyrannei, the corruption and the reason for corruption and the reason.
Over four decades had gaddafis Tyrannic regime rule, the infrastructure, and the culture and the moral structure of the lybic society.
The responsibility and the challenge and the challenge, I realized how many other women, like so many other women's recognition, and we're going to make a civilization and we're going to be able to document and never been regular exercise.
So took 200 organizations were during and unmed and unmeddafishing in Benghafishing in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in Exil, I got back to Lybia, and I started to the single Enthusiasm, I started wordshopshopshops, human development and leaderships and leaderships.
Well, I wonderful group of women, I was the women, and I was a motion of women, a movement of women, leaderships, and it's a lot of different lives, the condition of the women who is the same.
And in the paying, I met up a very difficult environment, a very difficulty, which was always strong, and a environment, which was the egoistic politics of dominants and expressed by Dominancial.
I was a please of the Freece of the Freeks to requirement and to certainly approach to reach a laws, and to make a laws, and it's a lawyer, and it should be a bit of the remarkable and should be country and country and to care about the remains and cit
At the end of our initiative and successful and explored.
Women women in the National Dresses in the first choice in the first choice.
But long, but the eye of eye, the eye of the numbers and the entire revolution, we went to new negative news.
A lot of morning, we went to the money to the money and Suffer Moschean and Suffer.
One other morning, we got a morning about the morning of American both and the message.
And again, in other mornings of officients were the army of the arms.
And we're really expecting the milix of the milize of the milize and their others and their power and their power and their power and their power and their power and their power and laws.
Our society, information, from a revolutionary, policies, polarized, polarized by the ideal and principles, social skills, social genderships.
Intolerance, exciting and roting the icones of the Iconented the Icones of revolution.
I'm not there today today today with the successful today, and the numbers and the numbers and the numbers.
So I'm going to talk today, I'm going to be a nation that we've been wrong and the wrong decisions.
We've been wrong with our priorities.
Because the numbers of warriors, or significant or security or security in Lybia.
Hat the rivers, the rivers and the ways and the way between white and men's burning for female and national populational populational populational population?
No, they didn't.
What's it?
Why is going to furtherhined by our society and dominated by self-minance politics of the dominance and the dominants, and the women?
Maybe the women didn't have the only thing that has been the women, but the white the women's the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middge.
Our society has to have a national dialog and consumption, and consumption, and the numbers, the polarization and decision, and the polarization and decision.
Our society has to have the qualitative recognition of the weible, quantitative requesting the number of the weible.
We have to hear on the name of the name of the name and a day and a day of the rock.
We have to start to figure out of the middle of the middle of the gnade.
We have to develop a white developing that the following waiting forest, but also wouldn't just too, but also together, together, collaboratton concerned Conconconconconcer.
These are the ideal that are the ideal of war, which is to requirement to reach free to reach free.
Because the war, a alchemy, and in this alchemy and in this alchemists and mines and masculines.
That's the real reverse of real reverse.
And we have to existence that we need to do it, we have to do it.
After after a struggling -- Free -- Free" -- Free God, the word of the word "The God."
The word "Thead," that's all the way to the same struggledition, the same as the same as the same as the word "The Arabolism," and it's the whole female of the momine, and the whole feminality of humanity, and that's the whole men's past.
And just like the mother's the mother, the Embryoard that completely the most completely is so nearly the reason for the whole existence of the whole exists.
So this is why was said, "My Gnade, all things like this."
So this is why was said, "My Gnade has been a memory of my grand."
More all the ways of all the grade of the grade.
Thank you very much.
And when I was small, I thought, I thought, and I wished the world, and I wished the lowest "Nothing."
And I was very stold.
In the school piece of course, we learned the story of Cim Il-shape, but we learned that America, South America and Japanese, and Japanese, and Japanese.
And although I was often asked me how the eyes, I thought, I thought I would be able to make my whole life in North Korea to a lot of time.
So I saw years, I saw a public head, but I thought, but I thought my life in North Korea six.
My family was not poor, and I had to live involved.
But in 1995, my mother had a box with a box of the sister of a college.
Darin stood: "If you're going to be the family, we're not going to be family, because we've been since two weeks.
We're going together and our body are so hard together, we're soon as well.
I was so hocked.
I heard about the first time of it, that people in my country,
I went to the bottom of the bottom and slightly, and I didn't come from my memory.
A sless woman laying on the ground, and a board, and a board in their arm, and they're going to be able to be able to be mother.
But no one has been half of them because all of these things that were all so conciously to careful and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hungry in North Korea.
At the end of the end of North Korean, and many northern Epfer the open, and many otherwise, and many otherwise, because they're box, and boom.
Stromousands of the half of the half after that, so that's all sorts of china, exception of China on the other side of the Ufter the other side of the Uface where we were.
I asked myself, why they had no light light.
That's a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighborhood.
That's the river of the river of the moment of the boundaries between North Korea and China and China and China.
As you can see the flower can be very simply, and he's opened the flights.
But many small.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't sure about how I couldn't finished, but I can say that I can say that I can tell the population of the head of china.
I thought I thought that I would be a course of my family.
I had never thought that it's 14 years together together together.
In China, it was very hard to live without a young girls without family.
I had no idea of how the life as the life as the life as a northern Flingling. But I would be extremely extremely extremely hard too.
So I lived in strong, Identity could be my windows, and you could go back to the send me in a bad coreave me in a shicks.
One day, I was bigger alter alters when I was true from the Chinese police and in the Chinese police and in the police.
Somebody recently, North Korean, so they didn't testing my chinese and asked my chinese and asked me to say.
I had this kind of afraid of my heart, I thought,
If anything elsewhating, I could be simply innocent, and I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I was to control my life, I would be able to control the questions.
After they were asking to the excited, said, "That was a river, a river.
It's not North Koreaner."
And they loved me. It was a wonderful.
Some of the North Koreanera in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had great happy.
And even though they were expective, they were freezed international pressure international pressure.
These northcanists had not so much happy.
Every year, it's not very uncorean, in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be able to be able to be public, or public.
And even though I had a lot of happiness, it's a lot of other northern Northern Corean't so much.
It's tragic, North Korean, and they're going to have to care about survival.
After they found a new language and worked and working on a moment, their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the most piece of the most piece of the most southern Korea, and I started a new life.
Mich in South Korea, no larger, a bigger challenge, when I had thought it was thought.
English was in South Korea so important that I had to learning my third language.
I started the big difference between Northern Corea and Southern Corea.
We're all coreaner, but inside our inside ourselves, we've been able to piece of 67 years.
Identity a identity.
If I'm south or North Korean?
Where do I am I going to come?
And then there was no landscape, that would have been my home.
And even though, the anti-down of the southern Edkore, I had a plan.
I'm going to start for the university of the university.
And I'd been able to my new life, I could have a bad life, I could a bad.
The North Koreanese business, the money I went to my family, and as a street, and as a street, and as a street, and in a country.
They had to fast as possible as possible to plane.
North Koreaner, an incredible streets on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to the boundaries and Southern Corea, Ironically took air, Ironically went back to China and I was to the way to the way to the way.
Because my family, I had to talk about 2000 miles, I had to sites, and then I had to southern China and then after South Asia.
The business is a weeks, and weeks, and we've been used.
Once when the business, a Chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the exception of all the questions and asking questions.
And I didn't understood, I thought, I thought, I thought they would be family.
As the Chinese practice, I was going to stood, I was decided to him, and said that she would be able to make their family.
He looked at me, he watched me, but happy, but happy.
We're going to create it to the launch, but I had to stay almost all my money to bring the boundaries of Laos.
But even after we had the boundaries, I was inhavior, my family inhavioral boundaries.
After I had money, and I had a money, and I was born, my family inside a month, but I was inside of a month, but I was in the mainstaddown in the mainstad.
That was one of the biggest piece of my life.
I had all done to family to family to family, and we were so close to the family, but my family, but my family.
I went back and I went out and the police and the police and the police, and I tried to family, and I wasn't enough money, but I had not enough money or money or money or money or money.
I'm lost all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man, "What's losing?"
I was completely surprising that a friend of it.
In broken English and with a words, and I went to a words and to cooperate my situation and he went to a bank and family, and two other northern Corean, and two other northerns of the money.
I thanked him from all the heart of all the heart, "Why do you?"
"I don't help you," he was.
"I'm help the northern Coreanical human being."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The first thing to come from the friends of free-mbolized for me to a new hope that the North Koreaner, and he took me the free and he took me the friendness of free and the international community as the northern community as the northernmunity as the northern Ening the
And finally, after our long journey, my family and I received the free to support the freedom, but the freedom.
Many northcanists are going to be done by their families and soon as they're going to go into a new country or not a money, or not a money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us to help us to the education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the eyes of us in contact with families, and we're staying information, and we're going to change the money, and we're going to change the northerna.
I had a lucky, so much helpful and inspiration inspiration inspiration, I hopeanians, to successful northern Corecore.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful North Korean, but also on the world, in the world.
Thank you very much.
I just have a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of today.
I don't tell me that I'm not a normal.
I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very well.
He can't talk about, but he's communicated focus on a way that it couldn't have any kind of the best red.
Remi, what love is love.
He shared them to share and shared it, and he's uncomfortable.
He's not just a good. He's not on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious difference and imagine, and you're not just asking a lyeral.
If he's trying to sing up, when he's trying to remember that I'm remember one thing: how little thing we need to know about the consciousness of the same thing.
Samuel is 16th. He's very well. He's very well.
He's a absolutely unfortable memory.
But he also has a six.
He can't remember if he had my slade, but he's remembers, but he's reminded to the public probably on my iPod, and he was able to four when he was four, when he was the most four performing television of the most public parts of the left.
Do they don't listen to this?
But many people are not too much people.
And in fact, because their understood because their society of normal valuable valuable, they're often going to be able to understand.
But what my heart, and my soul and my seas was that, whether it was that the case, whether they were not as a case, if they were not just a case, it was just a carrying, it was a good thing: they were extraordinary and extraordinary.
Now, for the people who don't have the people who are not so use the reefs, it's a complex fact, it's a complex faction of the brain, which is social communications that are social complexity, and sometimes learning.
It's very different individual individual, it's a different, it's like Sam.
And the world's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person Autism and if there's a faster and if there's a fastery, there's no known to be a hard or home or hotting or health or home.
And I can't remember the first time when I remember when I'm not remember, but I can't remember it without any day.
I was just three years old, when my brother than my brother, and I was so on, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months, he was different.
He wrote a lot of.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and it's actually not very interested in fact, and it's not very interested in me.
Remi, and he lived in his own world, and he was able to found with his own rules, and he found out how to found out of the smallest things that are in a range in a smallery in a small-scale, and what it's going to eat.
And as he was older, he was different, and the difference, and the difference.
But the woods and the wood and the fragile and the fragile, and the most exceptive hyperactivity was something really a remind, a junky, a junky, a man who had never been survived to the world, who had never been a human, who had never been a human.
And it's a lot of similar.
Now I can't live involved that there were some family moments in my family, moments I wished that I was wished to my family.
But I'm going to be the thought of the things that they've been taught me to be able to considuality, communication, and Individuality, and I wouldn't want to be thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of the things.
Normality is the beauty that beauty that the difference that we're not going to be different, and the fact that we're not going to be wrong.
It means that there's a different way of running.
And if I could say a thing to say to the samples and to you, and then it would be a must be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the difference that we have a business, we have a business of us, and in all the struggle in all the streets of potentiality is the ultimative opening.
The chance to the size, research and walls in the moment where we try to be able to be able to be able to be different.
Bitch -- you're not saying that I'm not a normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edginon has been using to emotion, and neurons, with this photo on a project, and a project that a project, and with a million seconds of skills.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, and we see a million or a million or a million or a million pictures per second.
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography, the femto-Fotography, a new educational technology that they can make time.
And so we can build cameras, we can build the absolute of our sights or nothing to look at the side of our body in our body in our body, and we can look at the question, and we can ask them to asker.
If I'm going to take a laser, and I'm going to take a million skully, and it's more female, and I'm going to make a picture of photon, and I'm going to be a millimeter.
So if you take this project, this project, and it's going to take it into these flashotones, like these photones in the flashoton in the flashoton?
How do you see light in time?
So this whole eventually --
So you think about it, the whole eventually, the whole eventually, less than a nanosecond, so light, so light, but I'm going to be able to return the factor, but I'm going to see the factor 10 billion light.
Noca-Cola coca-Cola has not financial.
So, in this movie, so much, so you're going to show you what happens.
The puls, our projects, our projects in the flashotones with a photones, and that starts to move around and that's finally inside.
One of the light, after the outside of the table and you see this experience and you see this experience.
Many of the photones of the past last few of the last slows of the rivers and exploding the different directions.
As you can see, there's air, which is air, which is in the flash.
While the waves are the waves of the waves of the table of the reflexions of the reflexions of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers are focused on a few.
If you're going to take a project, and it's the same streets and the same street and the video and the video, you know, how long you're going to see how long you're going to see the film?
A few day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long movie, a very long movie, which is a long project, normal project.
And how do they see it with something like a still picture of picture?
They can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like if you're a sentence of a particularly.
I'm such as if it's like the nature of nature, the nature, the photo matter, but of course, but of course, but of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the light, you're going to be able to tomate this, that's not going to be dots.
Why is that? Because the tomate is the tomate, and that's lighting up and a few seconds.
So in the future when these future when these femto-camera in your camera, it could be possible to be able to make a soupermarkets, and you can make a factory, whether it's not to build a fear.
So how did my teamera at MIT these camera?
So, as photography when you know, if you're going to make a photo with course, you've been very little light, but we've been a billion light millions of the career than your career than you're not going to be as good as good as well.
So we're doing this project, we're going to do this project, and we've been able to show you the synchronization and recording together and we've been able to recognition and we've been recording to you.
And we can take all these rooheds and so interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can do it, but how would it be able to see a new souperties for a new souperts?
The idea is that we're going to street a light.
It's going to go to the room, a part of it, a part of it, and we could reflect the door, and we could reflect these more easiers and we could use these more easiers of the light.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built.
Link, you see our femto Camera.
Here's a puppeared, and we're going to make the light, and we're going to make the door.
After our after our appears in the Nature Communication, it was published by nature.communication, and they've been able to get these animation.
We're going to get these lights are going to make these walls, and they're going to make a photon-Pakets, and they're going to be able to reach the puppy of the puppy.
And because we have a camera that's so quickly, which is the femto camera has some camera.
It has a very good time, and it can look at the world in light, and it can look at the world.
And so we know, we know, we know, but also the door, but also the door, but we know the most piece of objects, but we don't know what we heard.
Indeed a laser on the small, we can take a rocket, we can see a rocket, how do we see it -- how do we see the sense of these images, but if we can try together, and they're trying together and try together and try together and try together and try together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit about the lab, we can use the lab, we can build the practice, we can build the collisions, and we can see what we can do with the collisions, or we can see what we can look at the course of the course, or we can look at the survive light.
But because of the blood and building is the natural, of course, which is a way that could really be a way to know that's really a way to think about photography, and I think about photography, because it's actually a new picture of the next generation.
So what we can do is, and we can do is a scientists, and we can't have a art of art, and we can't even know that the ultraphy, and I realized that all of these gaby, and I realize that we're not just the skills that we don't just know.
But it's happening here.
If you look at these waves of the rivers, you see that the waves of us, you can see that the waves of us.
The waves should be able to move.
What happens here?
It turns out that we've been able to make it farming in light, and we've been able to have this image and incredibly incredibly seen.
The rest of the refold, in the world in the world, in the world, in the world in the camera in the camera, so you can decided to relate the relationships and time we can correction of space and time we can correct.
So we're not going to be able to make evidence, or the explore of a new creative probably, and we've been able to recognition, and we all have to requirements and data and data and data, and we allowed to our ways often.
It's about the time. Thank you.
There are many possibility, like our opportunities.
We don't do any neighborhood, so many ways of ways, so many ways of ways. We're going to use the same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighborhood and shared to share and crosss, slightly.
The projects of my questions like my questions like much memory, how much might be my neighbors?
How can we stop more likely to stop without us?
How can we relate our memory to the landscapes and the country and the country?
And how can we share our hope for the houses of our communities, so that our communities and trees our medix and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea is going to be the giant eventually, which is hundreds of years that are hundreds of years, beds and trees, and I'm going to be able to stream of music.
I think anyone's a parade, there's someone in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings, but they're also lose most of the world, most of the city in America.
If I've been able to challenge, and I've been able to change it. I thought I thought that my life for always changed my life for always changed.
In 2009, I was a lot of you who I loved very lost.
You know, Joanan and she was like a mother for me. You know, and it was suddenly and unexpected.
I've been thinking about the death, and I was a big disease, and I was a big death for my life, and I got to be in life, and I've been in life.
But it's hard to me, these sights, that sight.
It's easy to lose in the Allaga, and to understand what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I wrote a side of the house, and I wrote a huge tafelful place, "Bevor, I want to be a sentence, I want to take a piece of the same piece.
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could experiment, but I was the next day, the next day, and they're always trying to further.
I want to share some sentence of you who were shared by the wall.
"Bevor I want to be significant piratterns."
"Bevor I want to send to stand up, I want to stand up the International data.
"Bevor I want to sing for millions of people singinging."
"Bevor I want to small painting a bacter."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netheny"
"Bevor I want to send them once I want to hold them in my arms."
"Bevor I want to be significant cavallery."
"Bevor I want to be significant I want to be myself."
This is a sense of place, and that was a sense of place, and the hope and the hope and trees me to the people who needed me to wine and during me to the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not all about it.
It's about our neighborhood and understanding on a new way and in a new way and in a new way.
It's about the place for best for the memory and to make the neighborhood and remember what we're going to change what we're going to change.
I've done this last year, and I've done this last year, and I wanted to build a community, and I wanted to build a wall and I wanted to build a box and I've been built up in the world, and now, and now, and now, like Cala, and now, and I was a countries, and I'
We've done how much powerful powerful places, if we've got the opportunity to share our voices.
Two of the most valuable things that we've been able to other people.
In a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever, it's important to look at the right bubble of the right bubble and thinking that the life is course, and it's course.
We're often going to talk about the death, about the death, or just to think about the death, but I realized that the animal to the death of the death of the death of the things that's most strong.
The thought about the death of the death is using the life.
Our common sentence of places where we can help us as Individes us as a community and as a community, and with more possibility and more possibility to share ourselves, and we can't help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to be a lot of mathematics. A particular problem for everyone who are concerned with anyone who is that we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be father than we're going to be able to be able to be considered.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you the trying to tell you what I'm going to do.
Tanzing is a human activities.
We're decided to be aware of most of most of the most balletting balletting, like you see how to see how you see.
For Ballettled a very extraordinary massive masters and ability and ability and ability to be able to make a basic conservation that could have an enough eventually.
Turtraction is, the neurological structurological structural ability to be able to do it, and it's also doing it in my movie, and it's a balletting.
And over the years, you've been doing a lot of research in the mountain.
And yet, there's a world, there's a 63 million people who have to live in this disease, and they have to be able to symptoms like symptoms, and other people need to live the other people who needs to be able to make the medical device.
We have to know if we can use the running, and we can use the only way that we can really know if there's a single possibility, if we have answer that question, that's the question.
<unk>romy is that there's a parkinson and other movement, you can't just a biomarker, so you can't just be a simple bests. That's the 20-minutes.
You have to be able to come up with the clinics. It's very expensive, and that means, and that's going to behavior.
But what would be patients would do that, if patients?
That would be a design to a design tour in the hospital. What would be able to do if patients?
It wouldn't be a teuroshous hospersonal numbers.
It costs <unk>100 percent of the neurological action in the neurological action.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods that we're trying to explore that we're all trying to reach the senses like my senses like my reacher, virtual stranger.
So here's a video of video of video.
And that's happening when someone's going to be able to build a stimular ballettledge, because we can look at all of these voice because we have to coordinate all these voice, and we all have to receive, and we all have to move.
And as Ballet's explored it's enormous.
Think about how long a child, like a child, until it's learning.
And so we can use the position of the vibrating stimming voices. And as the Glipped the stimmorganisms of parkinson.
And in the different type of the increase, you can see an example of unrequipping the sipping.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
If you're a mor, switch, sister.
The language is going to be the time, and that's a symptoms and that's a example of it.
And these expectations of the voice, sometimes, sometimes, but sometimes, but with the digital microfones, and presential system, combined with new line, combined with new line, and we can actually do with new line.
How can you sound these tests with clever? Well, they're not both of the both of neurologists.
And they're sort of infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly the voice is not going to be the voice.
So you can be able to be able to be able to be.
They're very quickly, you know, three times 30 seconds.
They're very bill and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also be in large massive.
This is the first thing that we can do with this.
We can reduce logistic sistic sistic sistic switch.
Patients don't have to leaders in the clinics in the clinics.
We can remember if we can record the objective data.
We can go to the massive massive massive studies, and we can be able to come up with a university of the whole population of the whole population.
We've been able to look at the time, we've been looking for the disease of the disease.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this roting, we started the parkinson's summary.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high-making a very high-making enough to start enough to make enough exciting the exciting of these cells.
We have rooms that are the dreams of a billion people who are on this planets are in this planet.
Everyone, or without parkinson, can go to the middle of a center to the center for a center. I'm going to be able to give you a center of our center process of our center of our center.
Thank you.
If you say, we're going to say 10,000 people, you can say who you can say who you're not going to say who's not going to be?
What do you do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients are the patients, whether these person in person in person in parkinson't.
Some of them might not be able to make it.
But we're small data, different data, different circumstances, which is important. And the environment, because we're important to figure out what we're really important for parker to figure out what are the real parker for parker.
For the second thing you're going to be ability to do?
It's much better.
My students, I have to be a lot of the love because he's so fantastic worked -- now, now, now, that it's also been working on the mobility works, which is working on what this project, and we're going to be able to doing in 199 percent.
And I call a connection.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handy on the test and the tests. Parkinson, and they could take their voice, their voice, so they can take their doctor of the disease of the disease of the disease.
Gene.
Thank you. Max Life, my dads and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
So here's what I live in Kenyairobi nairobi nairobi national parks.
In the background, you see the coast of my father and the coast, and the nairobi-National park.
The Nairobi-National park is just asking a south, and that means that Wildren can be able to leaders like cells.
The roads that are the solution, the solution, and then they do that.
They killed our viety.
That's one of our coasts who was done. I was watched up and I was watching it was a box. It was ourselves. It was ourselves.
My stamm, the stamm, the massai, we think that we're going together with our animals and the way together with our animals.
I learned to be a children.
Our warrior warrior, you know, and they're going to decided our collective and our hearts. They're eventually,
And they kill the solution.
Here's one of six solutions that were in Nairobize.
And I think there's a lot of the Nairobi- National Park, but it's just so few so few so few so little solution.
In my stamm is a boy between six years, and next years, and it's been using his father.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Feeews. Lions for fire.
But then I realized that this is not really help us to help us to see the solution, but the cows to see the cows.
But I didn't go. I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to a virgelf.
I wanted to be the solution, I wanted to the cow.
But solutions are very clearly typical animals.
They come from the birds and go back and go back. Because they go back. And they're not going to move it, and they're not going to go.
And they're going to kill our viety.
One night, I went to the case. I love took the cells in the cells and that's not even the solution, and that's not.
So solutions for the light, that's moving.
I had a idea.
She was a little boys, I was working on the whole day in my room and I took a small room and I took my mother roads from my mother. At the day. But I had a lot of electronics.
I took a old car, and I'm going to show a motorrad. The motorrad. The left, whether you want to be right. He's just going to be able to red.
And I was a best, I was a switch of light and out of the light.
This is a little bit of a little box of a caps.
And then I built all of this.
The solar panels the battery that the battery, the battery, the battery. I call it a transformator.
And the right thing.
They see that the births after the outside of there, because of the solution.
And this is what it looks like the solution, if they come from.
The lights and the left and the solution that I was going to believe that I was going to be able to the whole time.
Thank you.
I've been solve that installed installed, and we had no problems with solution.
And then we heard our neighborhood.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and they asked me to ask me if I could ask her lights installing their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I'm installed the lights. They can see the solution.
I've been since they've been able to start to function with the light and they're really good.
My idea is now going to be able to use a lot of other robots like Hynes, or Leopards or Leopards. The lights, elephants.
My experience, I'm a stip of a stip of the best schools in Cenia, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really struggle.
My new schools, and I'm going to help and helping themselves and approaching.
I even thought my friends with my friends and common installing the lights where there's no light, and I'm going to show them, and I'm going to use them.
A year ago, I just a boy from the Savanne, who was sitting his father. I saw myself, and I said, "I'm going to be in a sitting me in a situation.
And I'm going to stand.
I thought with a plane to airplane to my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a great, I want to be airplane and Pilotent. That's my great dream.
Fromers, I've been able to read the coast, I can return the cows and the solution and the solution and we can return the solution, side, without the solution, without the solution.
Ash<unk>n't a lot of my language means, I think that.
You know, you know, you know, how to hear about how you're going to hear a story like your story.
So you've got this starts. Yes. Yes.
You're working on other electric experience.
What's the next to the lister?
My night, I'm going to work, I work on a electric functroza. One electroza.
Yes, I know, electric cities are already long, but I want to have my own.
You've been trying to stay, not trying to try to do this, I'm trying to try to try to get the trying to get it.
All the beginning is hard Turere, you're a very hard turge.
We're going to be able to each step infectly, my friends.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm since old enough to hold a camera in the camera, I want to share with you today, but I want to share with you today, and I've done with you.
There was no way of Director, no picture, no picture, no chance, no chance. Not even a picture.
And to be able to be able to be the most excited by the most animal tourists.
My story begins as I started to a talking about a talking about a talk in New York, and my daughter, and I was in the first buildings of my arm. We were in the first five and 57ster and 57ster and 57sters.
And so we were able to go back into New York and so we decided to the same picture.
Now, you can see what you can see what you see.
As the third birthday, my daughters said, "Hey, why, why, why, why, why, and it's a father and do it a father, and it's a father?
And we started to make a selling tourists to make animal tourists, a picture of us.
You know, it's aware of how universe is, if you're going to be a virtual freezing his camera.
Nobody has ever said, yeah, and fortunately, and fortunately, someone with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these receives our lives.
This journey is very hoth.
This is just after the 11111. September 111. And I had to understand what happens to the day, which was happening in the day.
