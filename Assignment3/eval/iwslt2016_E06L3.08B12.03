When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the clener of the clener.
My father was hearing on his little bit, women Radio the news of BBC.
He looked very happy, what was pretty unusual, because of it was pretty much more than the neighborhood.
He risk: "The Taliban are white!"
I didn't know what that means, but it made my father, I did, very happy.
"You can go to a right school school school," he said.
So the morning, I'm never been using.
A running school.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, and I was spent to school, and I spent it to school.
So I felt after I five years, I five years long as June, and I started my older sister, who don't go out of your sister, who don't go to a little bit of school.
Only, we could go to school.
Every day, we couldn't take a different way, so that we couldn't get a different way.
We had our books in the lefts in the left, so we would go out like this.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a little wall well.
In the Winter was, but in the summer, but in the summer, it was incredibly incredible.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the painting of the difference, the bottom of a week, because the Taliban distance.
We were never been never sure how much they knew.
Do they asked us?
Why do they knew where we know where we know where?
We had angry, but we wanted to school.
I had great lucky in a family in a family, in the education as important and turned out.
My grandfather was farther.
At the outside of a decided provinced provinced Afghanistan. He was to school -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- to school and it was dading its father.
My bilks, but I was teacher.
That's what they're.
Two years ago, she went to the ruhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here was the first in his family, who was a school picture.
For him, he was clear that his children would be him a children, also his daughter, but also his drotime, deadly everything.
He looked like a much larger risk of his children, his children,
I know that I'm going to be in the years, I was in the Talibanch sometimes of our lives, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective.
I had good lusted lustered. But my father said, "Thather," hear me. You can hear me.
No money can be done. You can be done in war. You can be done in war.
But one thing is always going to be done, which is what's here, and even if we have to do with our blood for your blood for your blood for your bubbles, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to still up?"
Today I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I was in a country that's been destroyed by war.
Less than 6 percent of my older my alters have a higher a higher than the second babies, and if my family, and if my family for my family, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as stolice Absolventin of Middlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather, who was my grandfather who was a family because he was won't been to school because he was a bad, who was the first time to school.
He doesn't just with my high school, but also with my high school, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the car.
My family believe me.
I have great dreams, but my family has still a greater trees for me.
So I'm global bottoms for 1010, a worldwide of the world, a worldwide of women.
So I've been helped, SOLALALA, and maybe some internat for girls in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country, a country,
It's wonderful to see how the shoes of my school with my school with great early chances, all of them,
And to see how their parents and various for them, like that time, and my parents for me, and I decided to me, and decide all the voice.
So as Ahmed. That's not really name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my dad.
And I'm a month, and he was his daughter and he's been in her daughter and they're the tath of the tath of the streets of the streets.
When he was home, came to home, and a voice, and a voice, he would be falling him, he would be farther back to school, she would try to school.
And he said, "This is now when you want to tell you, but I'm not going to use my daughter on playing my daughters, and overholds and overholds."
What Afghanistan, so I realized something that I realized something that's oldest, often, most often, most of us, most of us, most of us who have a father, the father who's been a father, and the results is that their successful.
That shouldn't be a little bit of rollege role in our success.
And they're holding thejects that are possible and over a lot of possible for a lot of their test future. But the future. But in a society like the in Afghanistan is the unfortable.
Our the Taliban went to school, just hundreds of girl -- because it was illegal.
But today, everybody in Afghanistan, about three million girls.
Afghanistan, he looks like America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how our change change.
I'm notice that the changes are not from the drawings and reports of the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I look at the school, and their parents, and their parents who are slightly set up for them, then I see a lot of parents that I see a lot of future and a lot of wall.
Afghanistan is for me to a country of hope and the uncomplishment, and it remember every day, and it's the girls, and it's the SOLALA.
So what I looked like I have great dreams.
Thank you very much.
All I do what I do is, also, my life -- my life -- my life was done in Africa than ever,
In 1971 to 197, I see that I see, but it's not -- I've got in Sambia, Kenia, Kenia, Algeria, algo, alga, algae, alga, algorderships.
I've worked for a Italia NRO, and every single project, and every single project that we're going on the legs.
I was doubt.
I thought, 21 years, we thought that we're good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed all we were doing all of what we did.
Our first project, what my first project, which is my first book "Ripples from the cambe, one, one, one, one, inspiring the sambias, like Northbasias.
We came to it with Italia Saatgut in Southambia; in this to southern Tal, which leads to Sambi flying. We lived the same of the sky of the animals and data.
Of course, the answer had no interests of interesting, so we had no interesting them for the work, and sometimes they did.
We were amazing that there was in a such an early tales.
But instead of course, why they didn't look at the simply simply simply, we're here!"
"Gerade is not right now to return the people to return the sambias."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these practice tomates. In Italia, they were so big, in Sambia so big,
We couldn't believe it and said, "Soubt, like simple country.
When the domata, and red, came up about 200 nights about 200 nights and asked everything.
We said to the Sambi: "Oh God, the Nilpferred!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a country."
"Why didn't heard that doesn't say, "I'm never asked us."
I thought, we were so great, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the American, which made what the Englands, which made what the Franzanzo, which I was data what they did, I was data.
We filled the non-down.
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainty, because we don't know the African people.
They should be the book "Thead Aiddle Aiddle Aidbian economic economic economic economics.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have the change of African continent 15 million euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money.
Les you just simple.
Les you have a African, what we've been attacked.
We're important people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, like we're just two ways, we're patriarchalical.
Because words, from the latest of the latest "pater" which means "Vather"
But they have two different beds.
Patriarchali: I'm not patriarch every other culture, she said, "I love my children.
Patronising: I'm not possible every other culture, when they were my dying my dyermin.
That's why people in Africa, "bwana, Chef, Chef,
I was watched when I was the book "Small," by Small," by school, he said, "Small," he said, everyone in the economics, if people don't want to go into room.
This is the first principle of the heart of the help.
The first principle of the help is Respe.
Today, the morning of the herr, who recorded to the board, a stabet and asked a stability, "Can you're not going to imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react on people, and he's going to react a system called company, which is never going to be a little bitiased in the time, but you will never be able to distributed to the possible of the possible of the position, the position.
What you do -- you do is, you're going to do.
You never never get a community with ideas, you're going together with the sky.
We don't work from broad.
We do this in Caf<unk>s. We do this. We do in Cneipen.
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally found out and find out what the person wants to find out what the person.
The most important thing is the lesson.
You can make someone else a idea.
When these person don't you do what to do?
The passion for the person is the most important growth.
The passion for the own words is the most important thing.
We help them to find the knowledge, because no one can be anyone can be anything.
The person with the idea of the idea, but it's not the science.
A lot of years ago, I had this one: Why didn't get to tell you what they should do, and people should do what they should do not? But we hearing them? But not in community.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
Nobody have never been part of the time, and they're never been able to say what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they see.
Planation has this blindow.
The clearly people who knows the community of the community of public trees.
We work to do a sense to do this, to do this, to do this social infrastructure, which is not existed.
A new boards, a new board.
This is the house of the company of the company of the bedroom, who's house with you in your head, and in the caful and in Caf<unk> sitting your lives, the middle of life, to find your lives.
I have this in It's trying to try to try to try to try.
I promoved to the time and trying to get the time and trying to say what they should do, where we should do what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had only through the street and he had three days, and I him. I him. He was him. He was him. He was Mori. I was him to him, and I him to him a restaurant, and I was going to go to the organizing.
I half these fish fishers, and I'm going to work and these wonderfish, and I don't look at a fabric in Albany for 60 cents, but for 15 dollars for 15 dollars for 15 dollars."
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government, and the government, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I half the mouth and high."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Make it."
We've done it in 300 genemal community.
We have 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go to an inside.
Peter Drucker, one of the best companies, the story, story, story, a few years ago.
Peter Drucker was Philosophyprofessor, before he was recovered with company. Peter said, Peter said, Peter said, "Plancial and economic society and economic society."
Planation is the death of the entrepreneurs of the entrepreneurs.
So you built Christches, without knowing what the course of human course, with their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these together to get this.
You have to tell them Disk and Privacy, and you have to help them. You have to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
For the presentation, you have the most existence of the most exactly?
<unk>rible, embraded people. The eates.
I want to say that compared to say that companies is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nicherbare fossil fossil fuels, and suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly,
The consumeration is not aftermashing.
The friends of the instandard is not afterward.
We have to look at how we have to look at Millions of people on while we can recognize them, transporting to corresponding and corresponding them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will be that technology for the green revolution? Universities? Can you're you?
The government? Do you're you.
It's going to be forever. And they're going to be here.
I read a future in a future in a future in a future.
There was a group of experts that were experts that were too future the future of New York in the year in 1860 to the year.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happened in 100 years with the city of New York, the shelful. The shelful thing: The Stadt New York City, which wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? You saw the course, and they said, when the population in this tempoint in this tempoint, they needed to be six million powerful millions of people who are increasing with the millions of millions of millions.
Because they went to the mister.
1860, they see the bad technology that lives from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, in 19001, there was 1001 Automobilher -- 1001.
The idea that one of technology to find a different technology, the running little fabrics in the backgrics in the background.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with company to work with companies.
When he had to be able to tell them.
In fact, they don't talk about you.
When you have to tell them them, engaged, engaged and living in the service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truths over the entrepreneurs.
From the little biggest company to be able to sell all in the lage, three things from the line: That's got to be able to be able to be able to be able to behavios and his financial.
Rates?
We never have a single person who can buy a few person who can buy a little bit of a producing and move around the money.
That's not existed.
This person was never been born.
We have found the research and our firms of iconic firms of the world -- Carnegie, Westing, Edison, Fordinarian, Fordinary, Jahoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed all the time that he was just a couple of the world, just one: No, just one person was just one person.
Now, we're going to leave 16-year-old subbers, and we started to start the first two side of Richard Bransons Auton Bransons Autobiography Bransons Auta. The first time, and the first time it's two-year-olds.
No one time, "The and 32 times.
He wasn't alone as he started.
Nobody green a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we make a community, in the person who needs a little bit of children who have a little bars and bars, in Caf<unk>s and bars, your engaged cafully, whatever they're going to do with this epidemics that each one of you.
What can you make it? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you go to the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Mo you know that I'm going to finish?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of freedoms that can be undergrounded by the companies, and people who have figure out of the middle of the middle of the middle of the intelligence of the intelligence of the intellecture of the economics and the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be where it must being age in the wonderful.
The penness University bat me -- a Dozentin for communication -- at communication -- at the communications in Communications.
I had angry --
Rightly, you know, the students with their big brains and their big brains and their big books and their big books, not trusting to me.
But as the conversation of the conversation, he was like Alice as Alice as Alice, as Alice, and a cannin, and a torning a new world.
I felt like I felt like I was asked with the students with the students. I was first about the thought that they had been discovered that other words, and I wanted that other words.
I think that to open this turing, it means, it means it's great communication.
We need to change incredible communication of our scientists and inside our scientists and in the world.
Because our scientists and insights are thejects that our greatest problems, like, to example, energy, energy, and if we don't understand it, and if we don't understand it. I don't think it's not going to believe that we don't knowledge.
But these great conversation coming to not come to be able to get our scientists and in their wonderful.
So scientists and ingener and inside, clear, clearly.
I want to show you a few answer to show how to make it, how you can see that we can see that the science and technology, with their technology, and the technology and spaneous, and speaking.
The first question that you have to tell us, who have to say, "Well, and?
Say, why was just a serious scientifically, so relevant for us.
Say not just that their drawings are different structure, but also says that their drawings that their drawings that their cooks, because they're important structure, because they can understand the operators and understanding.
And if you do that, what you do is, what you do is, then you're sorry.
Father than a hinds are a change for change.
Sure could be able to use their skills, but why don't you know why don't you just change their time, and time, what is it's a lot of us?
Our thought that's not going to make it's not the same as their nive looks like their nive.
As astein is, "Mache said, "Mache the things like this -- but not just like possible."
You can tell us something about eye, something about economically, without a compromise, without compromise, without compromise.
A few things are returning back to bring them, examples, stories and analogies, and analogies, and they could take us in your bannels.
And if you're working on their work, then the stories, then the stories.
Habt you ever asked young, why it's "Ston's called "St?
What happens when someone is that someone else? As other than anyone else, and with these points, and with these points.
A following this is not just long, but also too very long, but also too very language part of our brains and dading our brains and dading, we're going to be fast.
These example, this example of genes of genes, we showed that the special structure of the special structure of the trabele of the trabele of the trabele of the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration of the effect.
The terrick here is a single simple simple satisfying, which is audience that can be audience, when it can be audience, orients can be orients and generate our other senses, and also our other senses, and also a terms of distributed.
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these door and the wonderful and the science and the technology and the technology.
There's the inside I've been undergrounded with me, with the <unk>Nerd in my <unk>Nerd in me, I want to make all with a same with a same.
At the eurrength of economy, and education, and each other, teaching these relevants, so that's important, which is important, and multiplicated with the people who are incredible for their own work, and it's incredible for their own work. And society.
So scientists and ingener and inside your same, if you look at this same time.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy can be a cell phone in Syria in Syria.
With a handy can you a news and a protesta work in <unk>gype,
And with a handy can take a long time, it's high-loud and board and books.
All that's possible.
I'm a year, I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the city in this city.
There's a hundreds of thousands of people for change in the streets and the streets and the constrated.
We are in the highway, and we asked us that all these people who had changed on the tasks, a handy in the task.
Who in the Saal has a handy there?
Halt it.
Half your hand phoney, high, they hold them!
Halt it. As One, a bubble, a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everybody has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 350 cells of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.
This reline is called Rightliniety is reline.
This relines, that every telephone is that every telephone in Europe, every Internetdia, every Internet Europe, a bandbreak, a bandbreadbread of bandbreakers.
Who do you know? Who do you know, what's a EMail?
Who looks like a sMS?
And if you're using a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years from your telephone from your telephone or your Internetanbia or your Internetanby.
And everywhere in Europe, people are the people on Europe, "That's not."
They said, we wanted to these idea of the presence.
We want to sky self-bestimate self-dime and we don't want to be the telephone and Internet, and internet, and internation about us.
There were answers, Journalists, Journalists who said, "This, we don't want to."
And here you can see how two people on the streets of berlines of Berlin strong and said, "Freeity."
And some people said, this could be that could be 20.0.
The stasi was the secrets in Ostitute.
And I asked me, whether it works really works.
Can you really know all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy bones?
So I asked my telephant society that distributed telecom that was the greatest telephant telephone in Deutch, and I asked them, and I asked them all over my information that they all over myself.
And I asked them a time, and she asked them, and she got no right answer. Nures Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla
But then I said, I want to have these information because it's my life is protocolled.
So I decided to think a general recording to a generate because I wanted to have these information.
But the distribute telecom said, no, we will not give you that information.
At the end of it came to a same with them.
I'm going back to the ancients where they all sorts of information.
Because in the twice of the boundaries of the boundaries that the leadership of the eye.
So I'm going to have this half of environment with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
350 cells.830 ciles.
First, I saw it, and I said, well, it's half a huge date. Myetweet.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months in this datei.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I do?
Because you see where I'm going to look where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information that information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show the people that are recording means.
So together with oline and open Data City, so I've data City.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reince yourself and racooms, you can imagine and return back.
You can do every step, I do it, I do it.
And you can see how I see how I can see from Frankfurt with the circuits, and how many answer I'm doing different.
All that's possible to this information.
That's a little bit of a little bit.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
First, it's just like, I'm going to go to my wife and we talk about a few mal with my wife.
And then I went to a few friends and they go to the run.
And after a while you and you go to the right and you've got this huge communication.
But you can see how people communicate with someone who are communicate a time, they go to Bettled.
You can see all of you can see everything.
You know, you know, you know, you know, about who are the leaderships are the leaders.
If you can see a stuff, you can see what the society.
If you have to control the information, you can control the society.
This is a bit of countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect developed developing a society, because you can see a society, who know who's a possible, who's possible, everything that's possible to these information.
And these information are going to be months, 6 months, in Europe, in Europe to 2 years.
How do I said, we asked that all of these people in the streets in the streets in the history in 1989 Handys in their tasks.
And the stasially, who had been aware of the demonstration of the demonstration, who would have been a leaders who are never happened.
The case of the Berliner might have not states.
And also thought that's not the ice of the ice.
Because today is state information and companies, so many information, like they want to know how they can wrote about us, online and often.
They want to be able to follow our lives, and they want to read the whole thing.
But self-bestimate and a life in your life in the digital time,
But everybody has to be the self-dime might be cold.
You have to keeep.
So if you go home, you go home, you say that Privacy is a wertainment of 21st century, and that's not old, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say, you're going to say your attacks, just because companies have to species and state the possibility, they have to specifically, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think about your phone, you ask your telephone, you know about the information that they have seen.
So in the future, every time you use your handy, every time you remember your handy, you remember the self-bestimate change in yourself in the digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituosens, snellrestaurants, breaking books.
So the city planets, and so the city, and over the Names South Central Central Central, so it's changed him in South Los Angeles, which is something that's going to change what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituoes, snellrestaurants, books.
So like 26,5 million other Americans live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the home of the drival Los Angeles, and the Drive-bys.
The comic is that the drive-thrus more people than the privacy.
People south Central Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The father is crate in my fourth is quarter than about five males, five times as a higher than about 15 billion hills, which is about 15 miles.
I couldn't go to the more withans.
And I asked me how you feel like you would feel like you would have no curious food, if you had no food when you look out of the house, if you look out of the negative expectations that's the best explanations that has been on your food system.
I'm going to buy the role of the role and selling as buying as buying.
I see Dialysecialysecialyse, like Starbucks.
And I started to start that this is what I need to hear.
I captured that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And then I had no lustered more than 45 minutes to get a pesticians to get a pesticians who don't have a pestician.
So I plant a plant, I was a foodward.
It's a piece of land that we call Parkanlage.
It's 45 on 35 meters.
The thing is the thing that it's the city.
But you have to pay it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is because it's my responsibility, and I have to half."
And I decided to hold it into stand.
So I came to my group, and my groups, and we started together, and we started together, and we food, and operating, soon-wald, so the whole program, so the whole program, so the whole program.
We're a kind of prediction, we're making approaches from all social signs and from all the city, and it's free, it's free, and everything we do, and everything we do, and everything we do,
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone else.
The city came to me and he was practical practical a practical practice and said that I had to be a richard of a rich.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A rich interactions of foods of foods of foods on a piece of country, that's really great dead?
And I thought, "Cool. Her so.
Because this time wouldn't go to the males.
The LA. Times, Times, Steve Lopez, and she made a story about it, and talked about the city and talking about a member of Green Green Green Green, and we were reason, and we were reason, and we were excluded with 900 different.
We'd like to play in the hands.
My city rather than that they were soldier and said that they're different, and she love what we do.
So why would they do that?
LA.A. It's in the United States, most books in the best city of the city.
They're best 67 center.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flying to power to pants to plants.
Why didn't find the physically, they don't find it?
Through a plant, you know, you're 1,000 sames.
With green Bohan in the wall of a dollars, you're own observously in the wert of 75 dollars.
It's my homebotic, I say that they should be able to build their own food.
His eating food is like his own money is like his own money.
Look, I have a sense of a south Central.
I'm going to go there. I have my size there.
And I'm sure that part of this prediction of this reality, and I was fabricated by other people who were my own reality.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden is my graffiti. I'm plants my art.
As like a graffiti-knower, who changes, the walls, I'm going to beautiful, I parkla.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of piece and the plants and the trees are my dreams for those hopes.
They would be surprised what the Earth, everything can use it as a line as a line.
You can't imagine how he's a sunlume is a sunlume is, and how people are broad.
So what happened?
I've been experienced to a instrument for the first time and the result of my fourth and the result of my fourth.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the board of the board.
We're the board.
They would be wonderful how children are going to be able to be.
Garners is the therapists, and coastic and coast, especially, especially with the city.
You know, you know, you're going to be a superience.
I remember this time when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was circa, she was came up in my garden, and I came out.
I'm sorry, I'm suffer because they were there, and I said, "Wis, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I went told me when I saw people looked at me, and I would have been so hungry, and that's just asked me, and that's not just asked me, "Fin, you don't have afraid, you're going to be food."
And I said, "Thum teach, no, I don't know what they don't know what they're sound.
It's not too it on the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it back to their healthy."
At the other time I lived a garden in this observed in Downtown LA.
These are the guy who have help me to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how they were able to see how they were able to see with her mother and how they were fighting with her grandmother and it was great, and it was great when they changed for a moment.
Green reason is about 20 gardenly 20 garden.
For our environmental works like 50 people, and they're all free, and that's all freedom.
If kids carbon, it children.
When they were taking domata, they eat.
But if they don't get anything that if they don't get the food, as it's not going to be able to eat, they're eating them, they're eating them.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work, but they're looking at this thing -- I see -- I see that thing that's exactly on the pad, and they're looking at the pad, and the next onewhere.
The garden I see a mission that we can training these kids can train themselves to care their communities to care after lives.
And if we do that?
We could take the next few George Washington Carvernment.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Earth, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my planet. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole we can shared plants where people can share the food in the same blocks.
I want to take switch and they take them in health caf<unk>s Caf<unk>s.
So, you don't understand me.
I don't talk about costs, because I don't know, because it's not behavior.
The comics of news is that you have to have to behavior.
I'm talking about it, people working to holds and children from the streets, and they record the street and the effects, if you're going to be able to read your own food, and when you look at the barmers.
So what I want to do here is this is the sexy.
I want to be that we all sorts of ecological rebeing, Gangster, Ganger.
We need to record the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a great memory.
Gangerous, you're going to be selling, right?
And let's the waffected the choice.
If you want to make meeting meeting, you don't want to do if you want to do in a meting and a meting and a meting, where you want to talk about it.
If you want to make meet you come to your sell, you know, in my garden, so we can use any sort of powerful small.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite switches in the entire Oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No,"
Although in 19th century, a newspaper, a better definition: "It's a better definition, someone who is someone who is someone who is an astrategy, programming or line, programming and regular power, and his powerful consumer.
I have no idea what "spracheral."
Some of the words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all politicians that they try to control.
For 171, for example, for example, the British Parlament, time not the words of the dolbates.
And that was actually back to the mutes of a man who was a man whole names with the extraordinary names Brass Crosby, who was in the parlament.
She was helped him in the Tower of London and he was a muthor, but he was mutig enough enough enough, and he was so much more unfortunately, and he was so much unfortunately that he was so much uncomfortable.
And just a few years later, we find the first nine-fessons for the first neighborhood as Brass."
Brassed on the English word for Blech.
But that's not true. It's not about a returning to a record.
But to show you how Worte, how Worte and politics, I want you to take you with the U.S., I want to take you to the Unability as they were reached to the unability.
You saw the question of how to do the George Washington, which is the state of the state.
You knew it.
How do you call the leadership of a republican nation?
And that's been in the Congress, long a long time.
And there were all kinds of possible proposital.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernments, and other, other side of the hocity of Washington, and other both of the United States of America, whatever,
Not so a present.
Some people wanted to call him a nice.
They thought that's been during.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king time.
It would have function.
But everybody was incredibly done because these dolphins, because these debatte 3 weeks.
I have the days of a sense of a sense of a sense of the same thing: "Immer the same thing.
The reason for the population and the long time was that the representation was that the senat.
The representanted to nothing that what was going to do is that what's going to do. They didn't want to him.
Can you call them, and they're not possible to be able to be bringing.
They wanted to him the most final, the most painful days, the most familiar title.
This guy was "President."
President. They didn't exist. He didn't existed. But he was that someone else that someone else was a vamermany.
This is how the idea of a Jury.
He hadn't have more reason than the records, "Apasser" or "Apasser."
Sometimes, there were president little colonial community and governments and government, but it was really a unbed title.
So that's why the senat.
They said, "This is long, you can't call him President.
This cerles have to be approaches and from the countries and from the citizens.
Who will take him, if he's going to take a dumb small title like President of America?"
And also after 3 weeks, the senat on the senat.
Instead of the course, you know, the title of the title of the course, but they wanted to clearly, but they didn't know that they were not away from their own reportion, and they were able to create their own possible for methods.
You can learn about three interesting things.
First -- and the first thing I've been on -- until now, I don't find out whether the satises, even though the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was only just just just selling that the sense of the sense.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something that was something that you didn't have 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important point, that's the most important point, the Titel President of America" by America" not so much more than that, right?
This has been a more than 5,000 nuclears, and that he had the biggest volcence, and the greatest volcience and one of the world and one of the world and one of the world.
It's really a story, the title size of the title.
And so the senat at the end of the end.
They have a respectables.
And the other sorge of the sense of the sense of illness -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to all of these colors, like the cerling limits with the 5,000 nuclear spends.
So the end of the senat and the research and the representances because no one wholed because no one wholed, if you feel like a whole president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take with the me, and with the same.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality to control the reality, but actually changed the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelled 50 rebelled dangerous dalabad, a 19-year-old, fireed by Jacksonville, Florida.
I thousands of my black color country, I need a pair of country, and well, and they could see a rocketer, and I couldn't see a rocker that I couldn't see a moment that I couldn't see it.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
She was slowly, I was written with the warm, everything, all of the new pyjama Partys and Football players and footprints and footprints with ristic southerns and religionalists and religionalists.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to stand here, I've been working on South Afghane, Southeists God, atheist and a radically politized artists, and a radically politized the last year, and worked in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of things that we could make a lot of things about the art, but I couldn't make personal magically maybe, I want to make art, and I want to make the personality and cars and carrying the personality and cars and recoversity and recording the news.
I want to spend a day in life in life, Ganger, Ganger, who spends his distinction of the bommunists like <unk>Popstarling and popular bubble and political corruption and political corruptions.
And what's sunny can do is doing a candider than the Parlament and a choice and a choice, and a choice with the Slogan: "Whad and I'm talking to me! I'm talking."
And trying to use these campaigns to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosiosize as a nationalhels.
I want to take a corruption in Afghanistan on the ground, and I called "Ruth," which is called "Rut" and a policy, which you're going to street up a wrong controlss and cars on the street and cars.
I want to look at me, like the conflict in Afghanistan, my memory of my minds.
The war and the war and the free of approaches that have a new environment, a new environment for style and motion that you can only a model of skills, by the soldiers and self-mode and self-mates and self-time.
And I would like to see how a simple simple chubcaracters between cards Apparent from 189999, and that the idea of its own developments today, which is the development of their waterials.
But for all these things can come into the prison, they can be missed, they can be missed.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to slow the opposite of self-low.
This is my favorite. Which is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since a less time, I was working as a model.
Second 10 years, right?
I have the feeling that now is now in the room, in the room, because I would have a uncomfortunately to this cleidider.
I've got a little bit of this way, I've got something like this.
This is the first time that someone who's the first time to see someone on the TED book, you can see that you can see, so I think that I think.
If you were really a few women were really hidden, when I need to say that I need to say that I don't need to say that I'm going to go to Twitter.
I also asked that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds 10 seconds, which you think about 10 seconds.
There's not everybody has the chance.
These are very unfortunately, it's good, it's good, I didn't want to train.
The most difficult part is to cover the pullover about my head, because then you're going to be able to do, so much more than you don't know about my head.
In order today.
Why did I do that?
That was personal.
Well, it was hopefully like this picture.
One is a powerful, but a surface, it's also operate.
I've just changed your minds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been never been a friend.
I felt very unfortable and the photograph, and I said, I was solve my hands and with my hand in the hand in the huge of this guy.
And then, from operations or the wrong breaks, which I was two days ago, I was two days ago, there are very few maybe there are very few maybe our own own possibilities -- although it's unfortable and our lives influence -- and our lives.
For away to be hoth me to be honest to me to be.
And I'm standing on this book because I'm a model.
I stand on this book because I'm house a house, and I know, and in my branch, and in my branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people who always ask me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, is a model in the genetic lottery and maybe you might be asked and maybe you're going to ask.
Well, in the last few century, we have beauty, we don't just as health and young, and yetrically defined, we're used to be biological programmed, but also, finally, but also hospital and high.
This experience was created for me. And it's a superccess.
I know there are people in the audience that are skeptical. And maybe even maybe some models, and maybe some models: "Halt. Naomi, Tyray. Joan Smalls. Lui Wen Smalls."
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to be a teacher.
But I have to tell you that in 2007, that in 2007, a very at the 2007, a very highway from NYU all Models, every time, every time, every single time, and that was booked by 2767 money, and that was only 2767 or less than two percent of percent of them were only 27 percent of the process
The next question that I always been said, "Can I said, "Can I'm going to grow up?"
And I was like, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to give these little girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all.
You can be presidentinent in the U.S. or the next Internet, or a nineja-Herzer or a ninejurg-Herzirg-Dichinter, which is the first thing you know, because then you know, because the first."
If they say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, Cameron, Cameron," I want to say, "What's my cameron."
Because I don't have a responsibility for nothing and you could be the Chefreditors or the American vogue or the business of Hamp;M or the next sea.
To say that you want to be a model that you want to say that you're going to say that sometimes you want to be a jackpotto.
You can't possible and it's almostic and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, because of the models, because of the other than history, because other than highly, it's just just just just just just just fold.
If you can see a photograph, and that's just like a nice, and you can see a nice, and the course, and the cameron, and then we want to go to the picture, and then you go to the boy, and then you go to the poor, and this poor, and this poor, this poor, and this poor, and this poor, that'
It looks like this.
Hopefully comically more comical than that.
That was .... I don't know what happens.
If you look at school and a life, and a few Jobs, and a few Jobs, you can't say that you can't say that you say, if you say that you want to be a lot of the United States, but in life, you're going to go to the United States, you're going to go to go to the world.
The next question that I was often saying, "What's all photos?"
And yes, so pretty much of photos will be retired, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is the most picture of photo, and that was also the first time I was also the first time I had a bicinio. I hadn't even my piode.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I saw a few months took my grandmother.
This is what I'm on the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is I'm on a pyjama Party, a few days ago, a few days ago.
This is what I'm with the football team and in the v-Magazine.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these images are not a pictures of me.
It's constructed and it's constructed a group of profis, from Hairstylists and meters and meters and motographs and photographs and stylists and the prediction and the prediction.
Okay, askay, when people ask me, "Creeks for me, "Creeks?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-cm-Absha, which I can never met, but the things that I can't get the things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it, and we don't like to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge and a day, and one day I went to a laden and I had my money, and you had my money for me.
When teenagers, I went to my friends with my friends, and they were survived a redled empel and of course, we needed a redlection, and it was only one: "It's just away," and we could far.
I have these costs of things, I don't get my exceptions and not because of my personality and there are people who are people who are not because of their personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and I filmed, 85 percent of school and most of the latinos and most of the men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men and Latinos, and Latinos, "What's not the question?"
So, "How often I'm going to go to the path? When I'm going to look at?
In my researchers for those talks for those talks that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers, and these numbers are 17 percent when they're 17 percent.
The last question is, "How is it, it's a model?"
And I think they're expecting these answer: "When you're a little bit of harm and believe you, you feel harm, you feel very happy and fabulous and fabulously, and fabulously, and fabulously.
And Backage, we're going to give a answer that maybe these eindrucks.
We say, "It's really great, so much to record, and it's greative, inspiring people, living inspiring people."
All that's true, but it's just the half of the story, because what we never never before the camera, which I never said, "I feel like, "I feel like me, "I feel like me."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think every day.
And if you ask yourself, "What would I be happy when I was happy if I had drop your legs and glense?"
Then you should make a few models, because they have the thinst boys, because they've done the most coolest cool, and they're the coolest coolest cool, and they're the mostly women on the planet.
When I didn't have this talked about this talking about me, it was very difficult to me, a real bit of a real bit of a very unfortunately, because I felt very unfortunately, and I got to say, "I got all the stuff. And I got to say, "I know," and I got allowed me.
It was very difficult to be a very difficult, a result of unfortunately, and repressed, if I was one of the greatest nutrients.
But I'm also happy and felt like this, and I've been here, and I've been able to finish it, and I've been here, before 10 or 30 years or 30 years or 30 years, and my career, and I wouldn't have my career, because I wouldn't know how I wouldn't really do it.
If you look at this talk, then you're going to take a little bit of the power of the power of the powerful explains and following.
Thank you.
I've never been used together my grandmother, which is never been able to eather list in the exilience is, "Son, empty.
But who never been never like a gaddafi-Revolution."
It's almost two years, since the since of the since of revolution is inspirated by the waves of the masses of the masses of the massive revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, inside and exception, and exception to a day of the corn and to start a revolution, and to start a revolution of the tyrannian revolution.
And there was a great revolution.
Now, June, liby women and men and men in the first range of the first range of the rule of the rule of the rivers of the riversity, and social general community in the air.
They have a responsible mutes, by by terrutal dictata, by the brutal Diatur Gaddafis.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the farmers, from the farmers, until the south.
Finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 toted to start us to start our country and the tyranians and the tyranian and the Tyran.
But Gaddafi, every big big big big big born, a smile of the tyranni, who corruption and the reason for course.
Four year, four year, Gaddafis Tyrannese rule, the infrastructure, as the infrastructure and the moral structure of the lybical society.
The consciousness and the challenge, I asked, I as many other women, I as many other women who are reporting to look at the civil society and we started avociety and national distribution.
Nah, 200 organizations were during and about 200 organizations, and about the case of Gaddazi, almost 300 in Benghazi.
After 33 years in Exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasm, I started to the topicshopshopshopshopshops, human education and leaderships.
With a wonderful group of women, I women, I women who are the peace of women, a movement of women, a movement of women, and it's public lives, and it's solution to be the public public heads.
And I was a very difficult paying on a very difficult environment, a environment, which is always polarized, and a politics. Aman politics and explained by Dominan.
I lived a positiative of peace and women who are women to make a women, and I think a laws, a law, a law, each biological, each biological, and that would be a country, and to country and country, and to country.
At the end of our initiative and he was recorded.
Women women 17,5 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But long, but everyone else, everyone else of the number of choice and the whole revolution, we watched the nights of opportunities.
We're going to look at the money of money, we're going to change the money and Sufi-Gral money.
Another morning a different morning, we've been talking about the Mord American bothers and the angriff on the science.
At again, the morning of openings of opening the army.
And really, every day, we're going to look at the milize of the milize and their other people who are the people who are the people who areas of regulations and their missions of regulations and their face.
Our society, against a revolutionary, polutionarization, polarized and polarized by the ideal and principles, and principle, social community, social generality, social community.
Intolerancial, explained and Rache and Rachews, the Icones of the revolution.
I'm not today today today with the success of our reverse, our reverse, and the numbers and the numbers.
I'm going to talk today today that we have a nation that we've been able to decisions and the wrong decisions.
We've been able told our priorities.
Because the choice, the number of peace, or significants in Lybia.
Hat the rubber of rivers and the white and the white between the white and men and men and national various female violence?
No, that's not.
What is it?
Why is going to be our society and dominated by self-shined politics of the dominancial and the explances, slowly than women?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has female, but the female women's the women's middle of the middle of the middle of the middle.
Our society needs a national dialogue and conservational deliversity as they were broke the end of the end of the end of the end of the polarization and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative consumption of the webs of the Weible, quantitative consumption of the webs.
We need to stop in the name of the corns and a day of the row and a day of the row.
We need to start to start to do with the middle and the gnade.
We have to develop a white developing that would not just asked the following won't just to do this: Gnade, but also to work, instead of results, approach, a consciously consciously.
These are the ideal that are a visit that a visit of warbia Lybia, to make free peace.
Because the peace has a alchemy and in this alchemics, it's about the femines and masculines.
This is the real reversation.
And we have to exist, we need to use it, before we do it sociopolitical.
After a person from the Koran "Salam" -- Fried "The World," "The God,"
The word "raheads," and the in all of the abrahamic tradition, this is called Arabic Wurzels like the word "rahemic Wurzel," and symbolized the moment, and the whole personality to the whole personality of humanity and the personality.
And just like the mommbryo, the embryo, who is completely next to the same thing that's while the whole existence of the middle of the whole existence.
So this is why he said, "My grade Gnade, all things."
So this is why he said, "My Gnade, my grandman deal."
Maybe all the general of the gunnade.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country, and I was trying to bring the lower, and I went to bring "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we look at the story of Kim Il-Spection, but we learned that America, but we're not very much about the world, America, South Korea and Japanese are our fine.
Although I was often asked me, asked me, I thought, I thought my whole life in North Korea, until I would spend to a all the time.
With they saw years, I saw a public head, but I thought, but I thought my life in North Koreai.
My family was not poor, and I had to live hunger.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter a letter of a warm of a collegin.
Darin stand: "When you're going to be here, our families are not more on this world, because weeks, because weeks, because weeks.
We love together and our bodies are so difficult together, we're soon as well.
I was so hocked.
I heard to hear the first time that people in my country.
I went to the bubble of the bahnof, and I saw something suggest, which I can't be more from my memory.
A live woman woman on the ground, and a carry, and a painting child in their army.
But no one was half them because all of them, because all of them were so that they were to care and their families.
In 1990s, there was a big hunger in North Korea.
At the end of North Korean North Korean, and a lot of northern, and many more and many more over, because they only because they're just because they're just because they're just a lot of them.
Stromousands were always been hold, so that's been able to set me all the light, exception of China on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the same.
I always asked me, why she had there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the rivers Amrocast <unk>, who's the border between North Korea and China and China.
How do you can see the flower, the flowerful, and he's very simple northern North Korean.
But many sters.
Sometimes I saw people in the flower.
I can't say much about how I can't tell you that I can say that I can say that I can say that I was during the hunger of the hunger of chinaws.
I thought I thought I was a course of my family,
I would never have been doing that it was 14 years together together.
In China was very hard to live as young girls without family.
I had no idea of how life would be like the life as north Korean Flingling, but I would be extremely extremely difficult, but it's not just extremely difficult, but also, because of illegal fished in Chorema, because I'm illegal.
So I lived in strong, I could believe that my reality could be fly in a bit of my life, and you would look back to North Korea,
One day, my biggest alptraum, when I was true from Chinese police and in the Chinese police and in the police, and in the police.
Somebody recently, North Koreaninanerin, so they did my chinese chinese, and they ask my chinese questions.
I had solidered, I thought my heart would explodate my heart.
Well, for anything else, I could be approach, I could be able to be able to be able to be.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I was hard to control my life, and I felt my feelings and remained the questions.
After they were finished with the example, he said, "This was a research.
It's not a North Korean."
And she was a wonder. It was a wonder.
Some North Korean, you look at China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had great great degree.
Although they were expective, they were finally finally free international pressure international pressure.
This North Korean, not so much lucky.
Every year, unfortunately north Korean in China, and after North Korea, where they're followed, each other, or opened or public.
Although I had my flight, I had a lot of other northern North Korean, it's not so.
It's tragic that North Korean, their identity and hard to survival and hard to survival.
After they learned a new language and worked on a new language, their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the most decided to go to South Korea, and I started to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
Mich in South Korea, no one was a greater challenge, when I had been made me.
English was in South Korea so important that I had to learning my third language.
Audience I have the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all core, but in our core, we've been very common from 67 years of 67 years of the part of 67 years of the part of the part of the part of 67 years.
I'm fly through a identity.
Bin I'm South Koreanina?
Where I come from? Who am I?
Plike, there was no land more, that my home, that my home.
Although I had the anpassion of the south Korean life, I had a plan.
I'm already for the attention of the university.
Gerade as I was going to be able to high school, I was a bit of a bit.
The north Korean body, the money, which I was able to send my family, and when streets were my family between the family between place.
They had to fly as possible as possible, so I started to plan.
North Korean, a unbelievable stream back to their way.
It's almost impossible to consumer and South Korea and South Korea, Ironically to China and I was going back to China and made me back to China and I was on the way to the northern Grengthan Grence.
Because my family, I had to live them, I had to live them more than 2,000 miles through China and then after South Asia.
The business is a week, and weeks, and we were more almost almost almost fastic.
Atain, when the business was a chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the except of all, and he started questions.
There's no chinese family, I thought I thought she would be finished.
When the Chinese examily, my family, I decided told him, and she said that she was doing their job, and I was since.
He looked at me, but he looked at me, but he was happy.
We've got to read it to the laotic garren, but I had took all my money to broken the gorder of Laosaos.
But even after we had the boundaries of the boundaries, my family inhaft, because of illegal garrency.
After I had money and shoots and shoot my family, my family in a month, but my family, my family was briefly in the highway from Losaos.
This was one of the greatest running of my life.
I had all done to sleep my family to family, and we were so close to the family, but my family, just my family, just family.
I went back and I went to the increasing and the police and trying to doubt and try to be enough to be enough money, but I had not enough money or money or money or money or money or money.
I'm lost all my hope.
And then I asked me the voice of a man, "What's los?"
I was found that I was surprised that a friend.
In broken English and with a wordshter and I was reclaring my situation and without a bank, and without a bankomat, and two numbers for my family and two northern Korean, and two northers to get out of the opposite.
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why help me?"
"I help you not help you," he was.
"I help the north Korean people."
Mirus was a symbolic moment in my life.
The frequencymbolized frembolised for me a new hope for me to a new hope, and he showed me the North Korean, and he showed me the friends and the freedoms of fuels, and the companies of the Northern Corthernics.
Finally, after our long risk, my family and I remained family, but the freeks, but the freedom.
Many North Korean, by their families, and soon as they were in a new country, they're going to start with a new country or not a money or not a money.
The international community can help us help us to help us to help us the education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the eye and the eye, because many of us have been still in contact with families, and we're going to change them information and generation, the money, the northerna.
I had a happiness, so much hype and inspiration inspiration in my life, I hope that I hopeful North Korean American corean, with international companies.
I'm sure you're a lot more successful North Korean North Korean, also on the world, also on the book of TED.
Thank you very much.
I've just a bit of a bit.
I don't say that I'm notice.
I want to tell you my brothers.
Remi is 22, big, and very well.
He can't talk about, but he can't communicated freedom, like some of the best redning might not be able to do.
Remi white what love is.
He's part of them, and he expensive and expensive.
He's not just a real. He doesn't go on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious difference and imagine, and imagine, he's never been a light.
If he looked at our childhood, looking at words, and I remember that I remember one thing: how to remember one thing: how would we know about the consider that we need to know about the unconsciousness.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He's absolutely unfortable memory.
But he also has a since.
He can't remember if he remember my shocolate, but he remember the public public published by every long time, he was fouring on my iPod, as he was four, as fourth of all the television of my television.
Don't they don't even incredibly?
But a lot of people don't stimate.
And in fact, because their consideration of normal vision of normal pasis, they're often about it, they're often wrong.
But what my hearts and my soul and my selection was that, although that was that the case was that the case was not as a case, although they were just a bit more than that they could be a bit of authorian and extraordinary -- extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who don't trust asked to the prediction of you who are a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, which is the social communications, and sometimes the large function.
It's like every individual in every individual, it's space as sample.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person Autism, and even though it was a fastest, and although it's a fastest developments of the world, there's no recognition or healthy or healthy.
And I can't remember the first time when I remember autism, but I can't remember not a day without day.
I was born three years old when my brother was born, and I was so on, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months was different.
He wrote a lot of.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and actually he didn't really interested in my fact,
Remi, and regulated in his own world, with his own world, with his own rules, and he found out of the smallest things like about how about Autosa, like autosm, which is whatever, which is what it's studying it.
And when he was older, he was different and the difference, and the difference.
But the woods and the wood and the frust and the frust and the neverage hyperactivity was something really a really single thing: a reinfugeous natures, a junk, a junk, who had never been a human, who had never been a human, who had never been a human.
At the extraordinary.
Well, I can't likely to find out that there was some moments in my family, moments, moments I wished to me that they were exactly how I would be like I would like I would be like I would be.
But I'm going to go back to the thoughts that they've been taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these things I don't want to tell you that these things I would want to tell you.
Normality about the beauty, the beauty that we're going to give us, and the fact that we're different, that we're not that one of us is that one of us.
It means that there's a different way of responsible.
And if I just a thing to tell you after Remi, and then you wouldn't be normal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, Autistic or not, the difference that we have a story that we have a story! Everybody from us, and in all the streets, and in everything is the ultimate open-foresty opencial opencial opencial.
The chance on size, Fortress and wall and walls in the moment, in the moment that we try to be different.
Bitte -- you don't say that I'm not a normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgggon has a leader and neuriosity, with this photo on the photo on the project, and with a project, and with a million second, and with a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, we're not seeing the world or a million or a million or a million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion pictures per second.
I'm going to tell you a new kind of photography, which is a new a new a new education that they can make a new education, which is that they can sell the time that they can make time.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the absolutely sightly or without education or without a beautiful body in our body, and really in our body, and really in our body, which we can ask myself, which is myself.
If I'm going to take a laser and him in a million seconds, and I'm going to be more female -- that's more female -- that's a packet of Pakethoton, and this is a millimeter and this project, and this project is going to be a picture, and this project.
So if you take this project, this photones, and it's in these flashs, and it's going to be small, how these photones in the fly?
How does it look like light in time?
So this whole events --
So think about it, the whole events are actually drawing a nanosecond than a nanosecond -- so lights -- so light to get these streets -- but I'm going back to the factor of this video to 10 billion times, so you can see that you can see the factor.
Noca-Cola coca-Cola has not financial.
So in this filmm is very much, so let me show you what happens to show you what happens.
The puls, our project, our project, truth in the flash with a photonpaket, which is starting to move and that's always slightly inside.
A part of the light, after the light, and you see these experience and you see these experience.
Many of the photones are reaching the potential of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers.
How do you can see, there's airl, which is airl, which is in the flash.
Whiledes are breading to the waves on the table and white of the reflexions of the reflexions of the focus on the end of the focuss.
If you take a south of project, and it's the same street and that video back to 10 billion billion billion, and the video, you know, how long you know how long you have to see here?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long film -- from a long film -- from a long project, normal project.
And how does it look like a still billion pictures?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, the table and the walls in the background.
It's like if you have a sense of a teich.
Mir he looked like this, as if the nature as a photo mal, yeahils a femto-Bild, but of course, of course, of course, of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you will see that if you'll see that if the lights the light, that if the tomate of the another. They're not going to be done.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and that's the light in their light and after a million seconds.
So in future, if these future when these femto-Kamera in your camera, it might be able to be able to be able to make it in a supermarket, and you can see if a fear, no recognize it's not going to build a fear.
So how did my teamera in MIT these camera?
So as photographs, if you know, you know, you have a photographically do you have very little light, but we've got a billion light, but we've got a billion times as your citizens, so you get a good light.
So we do this: We're doing this projectil, this projectil, this photones, and showing this packet, and then repeating the synchronison and this genigabytes of data, we recording to record this focus on the footpres.
And we can take all these rohdates, and we can make very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can make us feel like, but how would it with a new super future for a new southern southern surgery: to see ecking?
The idea is that we're going to strong the door.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it, a part of it will reflectly back to the door, and we could reflect the camera and we could use these more simploye.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built.
Link of our femto-Kamera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to let the light.
After our abhandlation in the "Nature Communication," was published by nature.communication.communication.communication.
We're going to be able to get away from the light, and they're going to be able to help and that potones are going to be in all the rest of the potones, and some of the potones, and then the light, and then the light will be reproduce the trees.
And because we have a camera, the so fast -- our femto-Kamera has some single camera.
It's a very good time, and she can look at the world, and they can look at the world.
And then we know, of course, we know, but also the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what we don't know what the points.
So what we can see a laser ones, we can see a rooh-boh-Bilding -- how they see it on the screen -- not really sense of these images, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they try together and try together, and they try together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We can see a big, we can see the voice, and we can see the practice, we can build the cars, we can build the collisions that can build what's going to see what's going to see what we can do in order to look at the survey.
But because of the blood and the bubble is the natural, of course, which is why the really a while that's why the most picture is now a way to think about female photography, a new picture of memory, because of the next generation of medicine.
So, as we can do this, and we can do a scientists, and we can have a scientists, a couple of the ultra-traphy, and I was clearly clearly that all of these gigabytes, and that every time we don't know every time we don't know anything education.
But it's also happening here.
If you look at these waves of the rivers, you see that the waves you see that the waves of us.
The waves should be moving to us.
What happens?
It turns out that we're almost in Light, because we've almost in Light, and astein, and astein had seen this image of incredibly walking.
The records, in the events in the world, in the world, he seems in the world, in the camera in the camera, so you can relationship the relationships, so we can create these consumer.
So, if we were able to focus on photography, or the experience, and we can make a new data, or new data, or new data, we all have data, and we all have datails, and we allowed our ways.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many opportunities like our opportunities.
We don't make any night in the street, so many ways, so many ways, so many ways, we use this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and there's a lot of things like aircleber, shablones and circlones.
The projects from my questions, how much matters like many mixed my neighbors?
How can we stop more things, without us to stop more things?
How can we share our memory of the memory of the buildings and the country?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so our community, our community and trees our beds and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My selection is going to be since of the hundreds of years, who have hundreds of years, bed, beds and trees, and trees line. I'm sattled to a stad, and I've always been in the music.
I think every time, every time you never have anyone, there's no one parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings, but she's also the city of the world, but they're also the city of the city.
I'm going to be able to do this house and I have to beautiful, and I thought I could also changed my life for always changed my life for always changed my life for always changed my life.
In 2009, I was a very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death.
I've been thinking about the death, and I was a big disease for my life, and it needs to my life, and it needs to me to me, and I've been in life.
But it's hard to me, this sort of predictions, every day.
It's easy to lose in the middle and trying to understand what really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I had a side of the house of the house and wrote and wrote with a shark and I wrote the lucky, I want to be satter."
I wasn't sure what I could experiment on the experiment, but I was the next day, but it was the next day, and they're always completely far.
I want to share some sense of you who were shared to the walls that were written.
"Bevor I want to ster, I want to be away from pirattern."
"Bevor I want to stervey, I want to stand up the International Datums."
"Bevor I want to sing for millions of people, I want to singing."
"Bevor I want to ster, I want to plant a baump."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "nethen."
"Bevor I want to ster, I want them to go to my arms."
"Bevor I want to be stervallery."
"Bevor I want to be stervor, I want to be myself."
This is after all the place was to be a sense of place, and the hope and dreams and dreams of people needed me to the laughter and translated me, and translated me.
It's about knowing that you don't know anything.
It's about our neighbors and understanding and second and look at a new and way.
It's about it, place for best and to remembers and to remember what we think about what we think about what we growth, while we growth and change us.
I've done this last year, and I've done after allowed by living in their community, who wanted to build a wall, and I wanted to build a bask and I have a bask and now, and now, and now, and now, like countries, like countries, like South Africa,
We have a lot of powerful public public public public public public public, and more with other people.
Two of the most of the most things that we have time and the relationships, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever, the things with the right blick blends and thinking about the right blend and think that life is that life course, and empowerful.
We're often going to talk about the death, about death, or just to think about it, but I realized that the benefits that the death is the death of the death is the most strong.
The thought about the death of deaths us.
Our common painting the best places that we can help us as individuals and as a community. And with more possibilities, and more possibilities, and they can help us help us us help us help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me with a mathematics. A special problem for every problem for everyone who are considered to each other, is that we're going to be as companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I do.
Tances is one of the most human activities.
We're decided to be after most of most of most case and sentence and soups, like you see how you see.
For Ballettles a similar ballets of course, and ability to create a capacity, and possible events that could have a genetic completely different events.
Traigerially, the first time, neurological stories like Parkinson, this exception of the ability to be ability to be in my record. It makes Jan Stripling Jan Stripling Jan Stripling.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the mind.
Trotime, there's been a world,3 million people who live in this disease, and they have to live with the unheilable symptoms like symptoms like symptoms, smptoms, and more live in the disease, we need to have the market.
We have to be the research that we can measure, and last possibility, and the only way to know whether we have a projective market, if we have a projective market.
<unk>rigger is that there's no parkinson and other movement, you don't have a biomarker, so you can't just a biombs. That's the best news.
You have to him in the clinics. It's very expensive, and that means, and that means that means that never will never be the never been done.
But what if patients could do patients could do this test?
That would be a hospital tour in Kranks. What if patients, what if patients could do this test?
It wouldn't be a teacher.
It costs <unk>100 percent of the neurological action, in the neurological action.
So I want to tell you a unconventional method, with the method, which we're trying to exciting, because we're all in a sense of Suntuosen, virtual strike.
Here you see a video of video of vibrate video.
This is what happens in the entire condition when someone speaks. We can see ourselves as a stimman being as a stimmorganized because we have to build all these stimulate, because we have to build the line, and we all have to do the game.
And as Ballet is enormously enormously enormous.
Think about how long a child, like a child, until it to talk about it.
And by the louds, we can use the position of vibrate stimmlipping. And as the game game stimmorganized the stimorganson.
On the other ways of the different vision, you can see a regular stimming voice.
We see this same symptoms.
Toes, swface, Steificity.
The language will be such a time, and that's a smptomsymptomsymptomsymptom.
These expectations, the voice, you can be minimal, but sometimes, sometimes, but with digital microfones and prisoners, combined with news, combined with new laware, with new laws, and we can actually farming with news.
How can you look at this tests with clinical mess? Well, they're not a certainly neurologists.
They're in the world. The infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly. It's not going to be the voice of experts.
So you can be able to be able to be able to be.
They're very fast, three seconds.
They're very billed and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also be in great massive it.
This is the first state of small setting now.
We can reduce logistic sistence for patients.
Patients don't have to leaders in the clinics in the clinics.
We can remember whether we can relate through half of data.
We can make a massive massive massive massive studies and recognize a difference of the whole population of the whole population of the whole population.
We now have the opportunity to look at Biomarkers for the disease for the disease, before it's before it's too.
Today, we're doing the first step in this direction, we started the parkinson's sitiative.
With Aculab and patients LikeMech, we want a very high-h-hear-old data to create enough to best enough this stuff.
We have space to have rooms that divided a billion people on this planet on this planet.
Everyone, or without Parkinson, can just start to get a few center to a few center for a few center. I give you a few center. I've got to be six process.
Thank you.
When you say, we're 10,000 people call 10,000 people, you can say, who's health and who isn't it?
What are you going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients, while this patient, whether this person in Parkinson, or not. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Some people will not be able to create it.
But we sammell a huge database, different environments, which is interesting, which is important. These are important, because we're important to make these extraordinary markers, which are the real markets.
For the second, she's 86 percent general general?
It's much better.
My southanas -- I have to love him because he's so fantastic worked on the mobile work -- now has been working about the mobil function works, which is also working on the mobile physical projection, and we're going to be 9 percent.
That's called a result.
That means that people can do -- the people can do with the handy, and people can make the testson, people with Parkinson could take their voice, their voice, so that their doctor of the disease of the disease of the disease.
Goes.
Thank you. Max Long, my domen and gentlemen!
Thank you.
Here I live in Kenya in Kenia at the southern Randi Nairobi-National parks.
In the background, you see the coast of my father and the coast, and that's the Nairobi-National park.
The Nairobi-National park is in the southernically, just asking. That means that Wildtians like cells like cells like cells.
The runkers who are the solution that are following them. And then they do this.
They kill our vieties.
This is one of our coast that was done. I went to be found. I went up and she was great. It was a great bit. It was our only bully.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, believed that we're going together with our animals and the way that we came from the himself.
I was a kids to kids.
Our war war war wars. They're going to protect our stamm and our home and our hearts. They're in the problem. They're in this problem.
and killed the solution.
Here's one of six lions that were done in Nairobi,
And I think there's a national park in the National Park National Park Lions.
In my stamm is a junny between six and new years, and news for the kitchen. So I went to me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fewer. Lions for the fire.
But then I realized that we would help us really help us to see the solution that help us help the coast.
But I didn't go. I didn't go.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to do it with a virtually.
I wanted to think that the solution, I thought, I was students.
But lions are very clearly clean animals.
They come up, the vogels and go back again. Because they go back. And they say, and they say, and they say, that's not yeah.
And they were taking and killed our vieties.
One night, I watched the stall. I love with a fackle in the hand to him and this time, and that's not at the lions.
Like for a light, the light, that's moving.
I had a idea.
Since as a little junky worked on my room, and I took the new room and nice as a new Radio my mother. Another Radio, but I had a lot of electronics.
I took a old car, and I'm going to show a motorrad. The motorrad. The left or left or left. He's going to be able to be able to blind.
And I was a best salters to me a salter and from a slight.
This is a little birne of a capture of a captain.
And then I built all of it.
The solar panels that the battery who love the battery, the battery, I call it a transformation. I call it a transformator.
And the reason.
You see that the birth, because the birth, because of the solution.
And this is what it looks like for the solution when they come from.
The light blink and the light and the solution that I was going to believe that I was the whole time in the bed time in the bed time.
Thank you.
I have this installed to home installed and since we didn't have a problems.
And then our neighbors, our neighborhood.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and she asked me if I asked her lights, I could found her light.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the light. They can see the solution in the background.
Since I have them houses in the neighborhoods with the lights and they work.
My idea is going to be in all cases, also for other research, also for other robots like Hyave, or Leoparden. The lights. The lights of farms.
My experience, I'm sustainable to a stip of schools in Kenia, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really excited.
My new school engaged and helps and helps through spending and tasks and terms.
I have even my friends with home with home and I give them after home installing the light, where there are no, and I'm going to show the people how to use them.
A year I just a year ago, one year of the Savanne, who was hidden. I saw airplane. I saw myself, and I said, "I'm going to sitt in a sit.
And here I'm going to go.
I thought with a plane to airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
I'm a great, I'm going to be airplane and pilotent. That's my great dream.
I've been able to solve my experience, but through my experience, I can talk to my father and the solution, and we can return the solution, and we can live without side, without side, without side.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I think that's what I think.
You know, you know, you know, how long is, it's a story like your story.
So you've got this stips. Yes. Yes.
You work on other electrical experience.
What's the next on the list?
My next experience, now I work on a real electrical dot. A electrical dot. A electroza?
Yes, I know, electrical dots are hard to read my own, but I want to have my own.
You've got it, it's trying to try, not true -- Ja, I'm trying to try and trying to record, but I got a shoot.
All of the beginning is hard Turere, you're going to be a little bonderful bonder.
We're going to be in every single way to do my friends, my friends.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I'm a song enough, a camera in the hand, is photography my passion. But I want to share with you 15 my libling, but I've shared with you.
There was no way to do not a kind of director, no chance, no chance to be a picture. Not even the relationship.
In fact, most of his, most of them were made by the ways of tourists.
My story begins as I started a talking for a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, on my first built on my first built on my army. We were at the 7th and 57ster.
A year later, we were later, we were repeated in New York and so we're going to look at the same time.
Well, you can see that. You can see that.
When the third building my daughter said, "Hey, why my wife, why don't you bring to New York and makes it a father to New York and making it a father to the ritual?
And then we started to make selling days ago, a picture of us to make a picture of us.
You know, it's noticed, like universe is the face of the face is when you're talking about a visit.
Nobody has never seem to be a lucky, and for someone who is never been done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rises would change our lives.
This is a very hoth today.
This is just after the 11. September 11. September, and I had to understand what happens to do is that a five-year-old it.
These images are much more than just a fear of moment, or a certain risk.
They're also a way to change for a week in the octobers, and how weeks and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical, but also in all the way to reflectover.
Because even though we always doing this, changes our perspective of malth of malth. While they always reaching new miles, I always see how they see it with their eyes, and how they see it looks like it.
These very intensive time that we spend with each year, and every year we have a little bit, and every year.
Last, while we were talking about one of our risks, we're talking about how they were suddenly reded to a reday, they showed them how they were small markets on a red markets, they were small kids, they love to learned.
And she told me about their feelings that she had been as a five-year-old on this side of this sort of empathy.
She said they remember how to remember the heart of the breast time when she saw a new years ago,
And now she looked in New York, because they want to study because they want to study in New York.
And I was slightly clear: The most important thing we all all know what we all experiences.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you, a active role in the most expective results of memory.
I don't know how it looks like it, but I'm going to look at this 15 images, I'm on a families.
I'm always the picture.
I want to tell you today today with you today with the image, and you don't want someone who you ask someone of us?"
Thank you very much.
