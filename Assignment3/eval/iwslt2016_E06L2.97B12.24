When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the clines of the closed to the closed.
My father hearded on his little roadio, gray, the news, the news.
He looked very happy, which was pretty happy, and it was pretty unusual, because the news.
He called "The Taliban are female."
I didn't know what that means, but it meant, but it made my father was very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said," he said.
I'm not going to forget about it.
A real school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I was a girls, and girls,
So I selled me, I five years, I five years, and I started my older sister, and I didn't get more than a secrets that don't get a secret.
Only, we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way to get another way, so that no one way we couldn't go.
We hidden our books in the books in the books, so we would go out of the way we'd just a skill.
We've been in a house, we were over 100 girls in a small walking into a small walking.
In the winter was available, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all know that we all know that we all our lives: teacher, teacher, and our parents.
In the middle of the difference, a weeks for a week, because the Taliban convention.
We've never sure how much they knew how much they knew.
Do they follow us?
Did you know where we're where we're in?
We had afraid, but we wanted to school, but we wanted to school.
I had a big decided to grow up in a family in the education than important, and tilled.
My grandfather was his time.
A moment of a came out of a decided province Afghanistan. It was to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school -- to send his father.
My founded mother, but I was born.
It's what they do.
Two years ago, she went to the rhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this is the first thing in his family, who was a school picture of ever.
For him, it was a clear that his kids would be a picture, even threats, even threats, but also the taliban, taliban, taliban,
He looked at it as a lot larger risk of his children don't send to school.
I know that I'm going to be in the Taliban, sometimes, sometimes, and sometimes from our lives, and the perspective, and the perspective.
I had to great luster, but my father said, "Taughter, you can hear my life. You can hear it in your life.
The money can be doney. You can be done in war. You can be done in the war.
But one thing you're always getting here, what's going to do with our blood for your blood for your blood for your blood for your school, we're going to do that.
So -- you're still going to still?"
Today, I'm two-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-y
I'm in a country, I was in a country was destroyed by decades.
Less than 6 percent of my age of my age of my age of my age of my age than the secondary, and if my family, and if my family to my school, I would have a high school, I would have one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, when stroudlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather who was my grandfather who was written by his family, because he was to school because he was to school, one of the first thing that was one of the first thing that was the first thing that was the first thing that was the first thing that was the first thing that was the first thing that was the first thing that was the first thing
It doesn't just practiced with my high school, but also the first woman, and I'm, and I'm, and I'm, and I'm auto.
My family mine.
I have a big trumbs, but my family has a bigger animals for me.
So I'm a global messages for 10x10, a global campaign for 10x of women.
So I've been helping SOLA to green, and maybe the first and maybe a single Internative in Afghanistan, afghanistan, a land that's still riskant.
It's wonderful to see how the students of my school with great ears with great ears with great ears.
And to see how their parents and vital and valley for them, like my parents for me, and I'm going to make all the time.
It's not how Ahmed. It's not going to show his face, but Ahmed, but Ahmed is the father of my snowledge.
And he was a month, his daughter and heimed on the home of SOLA in their village, and they're just took a bombs, just to a few minutes.
When he got home, he came home, and he sounds and a voice, and a voice, if he was going to send his daughter, they would try to send it.
And he said, "Till me, I'm going to kill me, but I'm not going to sit down to the future of my daughters.
What Afghanistan, so I've been able to realized something that's going to be able to be the most successful, most of us who have a father who is a father who is a father who is that their daughters.
It's not successful role in our mothers in our success.
They're hard to be able to start to convince and convince and convince and convince of their daughters. But in a society like the future of their daughanistan is the supportable.
And the Taliban went to the girls to school -- because it was a few hundreds of girls.
But today, but today in Afghanistan, three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America from America from America.
The Americans are recognize how we are solutions.
I think that the changes are not by the changes are not by the About the U.S. Trupted to changed everything.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents that they're a lot of their parents that they're going to do a lot of parents that I see a lot of future and a lot of future and a long-long walls.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope and the uncomfortunately, and the impossibility, and I remember the girls that subjects.
And so, they have a big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do what I do is, also, I'm going to be a year, and it was seven years of work in Africa than young man.
In 1971 to 1971 to 1971, I'm not -- but I'm not -- I've been working in Sambia, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria, algories and Somalia, with African countries.
I worked for a matter NRO, and every single project that we've been in the legs we put on the legs.
I was a doubt.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we are good people who are good people in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we've been starting to do.
Our first project that my first project, which is what my first book "Ripples inspiring," inspiring," inspiring the sambias, like Nood, like Nood.
We came together with an early in South South Abia; in South America, which leads to the Sambia, and we lead to the slow the populational populational populational populationaly tomata and Zucinci.
Of course, the answer to the an interests, so we didn't pay for the work, so we've been doing it, and sometimes they were also too.
We were just astonishing that there was a so early no landwared to a country.
But instead of questions, why they didn't say, "God, we just said, "God, we're here!"
"Goy to save the right time to save the people to save the people's talk about the collection."
Of course, all of it all wonderful in Africa.
We had these practices. In Italyzed Tomata. They were so big, they were so big.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Sook, like, like, like, like simple landwirming landwirt."
When the tomata, and red, and red, about 200 nights from the river, and we asked all.
We said to the sambian: "Oh God, the nilp.
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have a country here."
"Why didn't say, "I'm not asking us."
I just thought we were so great in Africa, but then I looked at Africa, I looked at what the Americans, what the English, what the Francial, and I looked at what they did, I looked at what they did, I looked at what they did.
We filled the number of the narrative.
They should see the uncomfortable -- you should see the uncertainty, we don't see anything.
They should read the book "Tead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyoyoyoyoyoyolecientist.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have given the African continent 1.5 trillion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money,
Lesen's just a book.
Lesen you from a Africans, what we've been doing.
We're an emperialists, colonialists, missionary, and there are only two kinds of species, we're patriarchers, or we're patriarchalical.
Both of the latines from the latines," which means "Father" which means "Father"
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalian: I'm not going to be another culture, they would be a little baby, "I love you.
Patronizing: I'm not treated a different culture, they were my drawing my service.
So, because of people in Africa, "bwana," Chef, Chef, Chef,
I was growing up when I was a book called the book "Small," by small," he said, "They, all in the economy, if people don't want to help people, then they don't want to go into Rwhe.
This was the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the helpful.
Today, the morning of the heart of the conference that conference, and he asked a stab on the ground, "Can you're going to imagine that isn't you?
When I was in 27 years old, I decided to people, and he was a system called a system called companies, which is never going to be initiating a little bitiating a service, but you're going to be the service of the passion, you will be the disturbances of the people who are the people who are the
What you do -- you're going to do is.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're setting with the set of the sky.
We don't work from Bice.
We make us in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Cipen.
We have no infrastructure.
We finally find friends and find out what the person who want to find out what the person.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can someone can a idea of a middle.
If these person doesn't like this?
The passion for the passion for the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the passion is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea hasn't know the knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this instead of working in a community, and they're going to hear the people who are we going to hear about why don't hear them in community? But not together? But nothing.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
In entrepreneurs, and they're never going to be public, what they want to tell their money to see what they want to see what they're going to see.
Planovered this blind fled.
The most people who don't know the community because they're never seem to public terrible days.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, social infrastructure that don't exists who don't exists.
A new board to created.
This is the house, the house, the house, the house, who's house, who are in the house, and in the caf<unk> sitting in the caf" that you're going to find your passion in a way that you can read to transform.
I've been in it in its in its operance, trying to do.
I was promoved to the time and trying to decided to make the other thing they should do what they do.
And so I went to help the first year, and I had a half of my first three days, and I'd get half of my first customers, and he was maybe he was maybe a garage, and I'm him. I'm going to sell him.
I'm going to work together, and I'm going to work together, and that's not going to help us a fish in Albany for 60 cents, but to sell us to Japan for 15 dollars for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent. The government, and the government, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I hold the mouth and highly him."
So -- so -- so -- so the government: "Make it again."
We've done it in 300 communities.
We've been helping companies,000 companies.
There's a new generation of companies that are insurance.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, one of the best, story, a few years ago.
Peter pressor was Philosophy professor, before he was businessor, and Peter printing printing pressure, Peter Peter Peterinable with an unpreciate with an unprected and economy."
Planelation is the death corporate of the entrepreneurs.
So you built a christian, without know what the clockets, and the most covered with their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to a little bit to a couple of this.
You have to give them a discretion and privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them to help them, and they're going to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
For example, what are you in most of the most applauded at most morning?
<unk>riving, you have applications. They have applauded.
I want to tell you that companies are the right way of the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- well, we're fossil fuels, fuel, fuel, there are systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not system
The connection of the powerful.
The Fron-Aridge is not afterward.
We have to look at how we look at the seven billion people to sustainable ways to care, care, corresporting, and with them, and with them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will you revolution to the green revolution? Universities? Ourss?
The government? Because you're forget!
It's going to be entrepreneurs now.
I read a food story in a food currentistic magazine years ago.
There was a group of experts that were in the future of experts town the city of New York in 1860 to bring the 1860.
In 1860, they came together and speculated in 100 years with the city of New York, and the city: The city: The city: The city: The city: The city: The city: The city: The New York.
Why? You looked at the courve and said, and they said, if the population in this tempo farther, they needed to be six million pathers to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be six million possible.
Because they went to the master.
1860, they see the worst technology that's lives from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001 cars in the U.S. 1001.
The idea, a different technology, and the renew that was a little financial small fabrics in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secrets to work with in order to work with in the brain.
As first thing that you have to give them a discretion.
They don't come to you, and they're talking to you.
So when you have to give them to give them affordable suffering and empowerful service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the smallest far away to be able to sell you all have to sell you, three things: that you have to sell the product.
Do you know?
We never met a single person who can sell the same time, and we're selling a little bit more produce the money.
It doesn't exist.
These person was born.
We've seen a research and we looked at the world, and we looked at the world -- Carnegy, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford the new companies, Google, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yah
There's just one thing that allowed to have a successful companies of the world, just one: No, just one person.
Now, we're going to teach 16-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-y
Nobal "wich" and 32 times "wir.
He wasn't alone, he started.
Nobody green a company, no one. Nobody. Nobody.
So we can do a community, you know, in the middle of the middle of the background, in Caf<unk>s and bars and bars and bars.
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you sell up to the money, you know?
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Moth, I'm not going to you ever finish?"
We activate communities.
We have a groups of free volunteers who can use companies, and they're going to help them to help them out of the middle of the middle of the population, and we've found that the population of the population, and the economy and the economy and the economy.
Thank you.
I've been five years ago, how it must be, alice in the wonderlands, alice in the wonderland.
The Penn State University, a docentin for communication -- a communication -- in communication -- in communication --
I had anxiety --
It's really afraid of this students with their great brains and their great big books and their big big big, and their big big,
But when the conversation, it was developed, it was like Alice, as they looked at the camped and a camp and a whole new world, and a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I felt conversation with the students. I was amazing. I was amazing about the memory they wanted to discovered that other wonderlands.
I think that to open up to open it, it means great communication.
We need inequally needs to change communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers and engineers who are the largest problems, like energy, like energy, and if we don't understanding, and if we don't understand it, and it's not going to believe that it's not going to believe that it's not going to believe that it in our necessar
But these great conversation is not to get to the scientists, if our scientists and engineers and engineers.
So scientists and engineers, clear, clearly.
I want to show you a few answers, how you can see it, how you can see that we can see that the science and technology, and the technology, and the technology and spaneous.
The first question that you have to answer is, is, is, right?
Say, why we're just so relevant scientific areas that we're relevant for us.
Say not just that their dragoning, but they also tell us that you're also saying that their dracture that their dracture in our cooks, because they're really important structure, because they understand ooporose and understanding ooporous and understanding.
And if you do that, what you do is you do, then you're doing it.
Afterwards are a hands, for the understanding of your ideas.
Surely, you might have a carefully and pretty simply, but why don't understand what's not just like a lot of time, and time?
Our idea of your thoughts are not the same as their non-in-in-ups.
As a mind, "Make up, "Mache the things like this, but not just as possible -- but not just as possible.
You can tell us something about your scientifically, you know, you know, without knowledge, without compromise without compromise.
A few things are there, there's a few things: For examples, stories and analogies. Asia.
And if you're going to work, then you're going to lay the stories.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stichpoint"?
What happens when someone else is going to be another one else is going to do with these points, and with these points.
It's not just like this is not just long, but it's also using too much language, and we're working on the brain, and we're going to be fast.
And this example of genes of genes of Genevieve Brown is much we're going to show you that the special structure of the trees, it's so stability of the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration for the effect.
The trick here is to use a single simple simple sentence, and the audience, when it's audience, orient it can be used to related to the pictures and graphics, and we're also going to doing our others and creating a terms of the distribution.
These are just a few answers that can help us to see these door, and the door, and the wonderlands and the technology and the technology and the technology in the science and the technology.
And the engineers I've been strong, I've been involved in me," with the <unk>Nerd in me, I want to make all the same thing with a same thing with a same thing.
It's a piece of your stories, and your stories, and your fields, and you're going through the relevance, so the audience, and the audience, and the publicly important, and the public work that you have incredible worked for your work. And it's incredibly incapevolv
So scientists and engineers, if you're going to be same, you know, I'm sounds me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A handy can change a life, and a personal freedom.
With a handyria, you can films in Syria.
With a cell phone can tweet a message, and a protestail.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, it's high-loud and coud and coud and coud and coud and coud and coud and college.
All of that is possible.
I'm a year in 1984, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the city in these city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people for changes for changes on the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989 and stand up in 1989 and stood up all these people who were represented in the cell phone, a handy in the task.
Who is a handy there's a handy?
You can hold it.
Half your hands, you hold, you're high!
You can hold it. A and a blackberry, a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone today, a handy.
But today, and my handy and my handy and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 35.830 cells.
Rohdata.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer 2006,
This direction is called Rightlinia to the fact that's reportation.
And this direction is that every telephone in Europe, every Internetdle in Europe, every Internetdle in the entire Europe, a bandwidth.
Who's going to do? Who do you have a message?
Who do you have a send of a send?
And if you use a cell phone where you're used.
All of these information are going to be seven months to two years of your telephone, or your telephone or your Internet.
And everywhere in Europe, people are the people, and we don't want to say, "That's not going to do that."
They said, we're not going to do this idea of the presence.
We want to be self-building in the digital age of time, and we don't want the telephone and Internetdlephone, and information about us.
There was an applications, Journalists, Priester who all said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to do this."
And here's what you can see, like 10, thousands of people on the streets and said, "Free freeness."
And some people said, you might have been to stasi 2.0.
The stasi was the secrets in Ostruction.
And I asked me to ask me whether it works.
Can you really all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone, I asked my phone who was the greatest telecom, the largest telephone, and I asked her, and I asked her, and I asked me, and I asked me told me.
And I asked her, and I asked her, and he didn't get a real big answer.
But then I told me, I want to have this information, because it's my life, because it's protocols.
So I decided to make a decided to get a couple of the information, because I wanted to have this information.
But the dozenship, no, no, we're going to give you this information.
At the end of the end of them.
I'll pretty much, where they allowed me to send me all of me.
Because in the twice of the boundary representation of the emotion of the E.
So I got this hold this high-making environment with a CD.
And on the CD.
Three5.830 cells.
First, I looked at it, and he said, it's a huge dateiber.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this datei.
So I was a little bit of a little bit about what should I start with this?
Because you see where I'm, where I'm, where I'm doing what I do.
But then I told me, I want to go to the publicity.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people what I want to show you what I want to do.
So with time, with a line and open Data City, so I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reincoomen and radiooms, you can pules, you can pules.
You can do every step, you can do this, after well.
And you can actually see how many running from Frankfurts with the stuff, and how many animal, and how many animal.
All of that information.
It makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just like this, and I call my wife and we're talking to you a few times with each other.
And then I called a few friends and they call a couple of friends.
And after a while you call it, and you call it, and we've got this huge communicationnetwork.
But you can see how people communicate people communicate, they're going to take apartment, when they go to bed.
You can see all of you can see all of this.
You know, you know, you know, you know, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to these information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a building countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect effects like you can do a society about who you know who you know who you know who's a red, who is possible when you're going to do that, if you have access to these information.
And these information will be care for months, in Europe, in Europe, in Europe.
As I said to the beginning, we're going to imagine all these people in the streets in 1989 himself in 1989 himself.
And the stasize the state, who had been in the demonstration of the stration, and if the state of who are the state leaders who are never happened.
The case of the mountain miner maybe not statting maybe not statt.
And also, not the case of the ice case of the early.
Because today, because of course, and companies, so many information, how they can get about us, and often, and often, and often, and often.
They want to have the opportunity to follow our lives, and they want to follow the long time.
But even though, even a life in the digital time in the digital time,
But you have to do for the self-bestimate self-based today.
They have to do it, you have to fight.
So if you go home, you say, you say that Privacy, you're a value of 21st century is not old million.
If you go home, you say, you're going to have approaches, because companies and state the possibility, they have to do it, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you're asking your phone calls the information they've talked about you.
So in the future, every time you use your handy if you use your handy, you remember that you're going to remind the self-dital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituogenes, brestaurants, books, books.
So the city planer, and the city, and the named South Central South Central to changed it for something else, they changed it into South Los Angeles, as if it changed in the city, what's going on.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituogenes, snellrestaurants, books.
So like 26,5 million other Americans live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the central Los Angeles, and the drive-triving central.
The comic is that the drive-thrus more people killed more people.
People die in South Central Los Angeles,
The father than four-down in my fourth of four meters, five times higher than about 15 miles, which is about 15 miles.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me, how you would have a stuff if you didn't have a stuff you had no stuff you'd have to see every time you see all the newgative effects that are negative effects that are the best effects.
I'm going to sell that role insists and selling how we're going to sell you how we're building.
I see the dalysecond daling sugars like starbucks.
And I've got to stop that the stop.
I caped that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't have a luster, I had no luster, I had no longer to get apple to get apple to pesticides in the present.
So I plant a food-wood-wood-wood.
It's a piece that we call parkanles.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is the thing is the city of the city.
But you have to pleased.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I have to stand up in stand."
And I decided to hold it in standard.
So I came up and my group, and I started together, and we started together, and we started together, and we started to plants, and own, so that's all the program, so the whole program, so the whole program, so it's all program, so that's all the program,
We're a kind of a prediction, we're collapsed from all of social signs, and it's completely free, it's completely free, and it's costs.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone who's a little bit.
The city city came to myself, and he told me practical audience and said that I had to be a public invitation.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A remarkable announcilities of foods of foods on a piece of land that's going total issue?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her to do this."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The L.A. Times Wind, Steve Lope, Steve Lope, and talked to the city of the city and talking to the city of Greength of Greength of Greenged a petition.
We'd think you'd have in the hands.
My city, and I said, and he said that they're support it and love what we do.
So why shouldn't do that?
L.A.A., in the United States, most books in the city of the city.
They're 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough fly enough fly 725 million tomata potatterns.
Why wouldn't find that, they shouldn't find that?
And by the mind of a plants, you get 1,000 samples.
With green Bohs in the walls of a dollars and value of 75 dollars.
It's my holy, I say, I say they should be a pollinate their own food.
His own food is how its own money is like your own money.
You see, I have a connection in South Central.
I grew up there. I've been my sons.
And I remember, part of this preparing the reality of other people who were fabricted by other people who were fabricianity.
You see, I'm a artist.
Garden was work is my graffiti. I plant.
And just like a graffiti-kupiti-controlling the walls, I think, I'm a beautiful,
I use the gardens that are the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the trees and the trees for these stuff.
They would be surprised what the Earth is that if you use everything you can use it as a line.
You can't imagine how he's amazing a sunblume is, and how they're using people.
So what happened?
I've been experience, like my garden to a instrument for the support and the relationship,
To change the community to change the collaboration of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wonderful how children are going to be confluenced.
Garden is the therapistic and careful activity that you can do, especially with the city.
And you know, you get away, you get earthquake.
I remember that time, when these mother, and her daughters, it was came out of 10:30, and they were in my garden, and I came out of my garden, and I came out.
I've been a bad thing to me, because they were there, and I told them, and I told them, and I said, "Wis are not going to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been looked at when I saw people who were so close to me, and I've been to do with me, and it was just asked me, and people asked me, "Fin, you don't have afraid of your food."
And I said, "Thum team, no, I have no fear that they don't think they're not afraid.
It's because it's the street.
That's the idea.
I want to take it, but I want to take it back to the same time, they're going back to their health."
At a different time, I lived a garden in this observed a globe.
These are the guy who have helped me to devices.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how they've been able to see how they've been pollution, and how they've been greated, and it was a great mother, and it was a great thing that maybe it was just for a moment.
Green reason has been plants, about 20 device.
For our environments, we got so 50 people, and they were so 50 people, and they're all freewills.
If kids are carbon, it's carbon.
If they eat to eat, they eat, they eat.
But if they don't get anything about it, if they don't get the food and created confluence and body, they're just food, they're just going to eat.
I see young people who want to work that work, but they're going to stick in this thing -- I see -- I see the paths that are in the paths that are in the path for them to the path, and they're never leads.
The gardens, I see the opportunity, where we can training these kids to care their communities to care after life to feel after life.
And if we do that, who know who know who knows who knows?
We could bring the next building Washington Carverton Carverbody.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Earth, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole wide of garden potentials where people can share the same blocks.
I want to take shipscontainer and they use in healthy caf<unk>s caf."
So don't understand me.
I don't talk about cost of costless, because costs is not sustainable.
The community is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about people to give people, and children, and children, and they're going to give the streets, and they're going to leave your own food, and if you're going to be built, and if you opened.
So what I want to do is to do is to do is to do.
I want to know that we all want to be the same, Gangster, Gangster, Gangster-Garden.
We have to make the picture of Gangster.
If you don't have a gangster.
Are you going to sell you with 'n't it?
And let's read the weapons.
If you want to meet with meeting, you don't want to do when you want to make you in a meting and make a meting and make a meeting, where you're talking about it.
If you want to meet meet you want to get your selly, you can put your selling you to put any sort of pitch.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite sings in the entire oxford English words, "snollygo.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No unparently politicians.
Although in the 19th century, a time, a better definition, "It's a better dygoing, "It's a currently a center of parents, program, program or last, and its own power, and his regular power.
I don't have an idea what "spoke" is.
And so I think, with words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians that they need to control the language.
For example, for example, thirds, the British plament, the British planets, the crosss the distribution.
And that was actually going back to the mother's a man's a man's a man's a manufacturing brass Crosby, who was brass Crosby,
She was him in the Tower of London and he was a mutigrant, but he was mutig enough, he was mutigrant enough, and he was so much supportable enough he was so much difference in London, he was so much support.
And only a few years later, we find the first neighborhood for the first message of the sentence of the brass.
Brassed on the English word for book.
But it's not true. It's not going back to a returning for the press.
But to show you how World and politics and politics, I want to take you to the U.S., I want to take the United States, when they're independence.
You looked at the question about how to build George Washington, the state of Washington,
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a republic Nation?
It was indeed in the Congress indefinite longress.
And there were all kinds of possible proposition.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvern Gouvernorge Washington, and others, and others, and others, and other, and other, and other, and other, the United States of America Washington.
Not so a conversation.
Some people wanted to call him simple king.
They thought that was award.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to a certain time to a particular time.
It would have function.
But everyone was inevitably sounds because these debate three weeks.
I've been a senator of a senator who's still always writing, "Immerica.
The reason for the relationship and the long time, the longer was that the representation was the senat.
The representation didn't want to do what's going to do is not going to be him. They didn't want to him.
Canig, and they call it, and we're still going to be able to bring its next.
They wanted to him, you know, the most amazing thing, the most person who give them a guy who give them a fellow.
This title was "President"
President. They didn't existed the title. It's existed. But he was suffering a vision of a vision.
It's like the prediction of Jury.
He didn't have more size than the records," or "Apart" or "Apasser" or "Apasser" or "Apasser" or "Apected" or "Apasser" or "Apected."
Sometimes, there were president small colonial communities and governments, but it was really an unbed, but it was really an unbed.
So it was why the senatures him.
They said, "That's lowerful, you can't president called President.
This guy classrooms, and from the countries and out of the countries.
Who is going to take it to take a dumb, when he put a dumbles like President of the United States?"
And also after three weeks of the senating.
Instead of the collection, and you know, the title of the collection, but they didn't want to use the clearly clearly clearly care of their own predictable respects and methods and methods and methods, and it's opinion, or not going to be able to be ab
You can learn about three interesting things.
First, I think that's what I find out -- I don't have to find out whether the senating whether the send of the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just going to be just approached the senating.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something temporary -- then you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Third, and that's really important point, that's the most important point, the Title, the United States of America," is not clearly nothing like that, right?
This has more than 5,000 nuclears to do something that he's got to do the biggest volcability of the world and a picture of the world and a picture of the world and this whole stuff.
And we've given the title size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the title.
And so the senat at the end of the end of the end.
They have a respectables title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of equality -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound how the classrooms,000 nuclear pounds, and so on.
So at the end of the send of the senat and the representation, because no one nobody's never lost the powerful that you're going to be the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with the most important thing I'm going to do.
Politicians to use words to use the reality to control the reality and the reality, but actually changed the reality of words, the reality of words, the reality of the reality ever change the reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelling a campful, a 19-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-y
I thousands of my swareness carby half a pairs, and I could have a pairs and crosss in the government pancial pancial pancer that I couldn't even see that I couldn't even see a rocket.
It was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was long time, I was in the war, and I was big, and I went to the long pyjama-party and football plays and fights and wetching and wets and the rassistic southern Clindian substate collection-con-controligion-cemon-cationalistr
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to stand here, I've been working southeists, Southeists of God, and atheist and atheist and atheist, atheistan, the last nine years in Afghanistances that worked in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great thing that you could do is a lot of great things that you couldn't make a personality, but I don't want to make the personality, and I want to make the personality and authority and carried and carried and carbon directly reports and reportation and reportation and rep
I want to spend a day in life of a dihad -- Gangster, who's delihad -- the communists like <unk>Popstar Bling" and popstary books and political corruptions and political corruptions and political corruptions.
And what's the sunshad gangster than for the Parlament to candidate the parliampaigned me to make a choice, "Whad, I'm doing. I'm going to do. I'm a girls."
And try to use these campaign to use these magnitude, which is to be the Nationalhelming.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and I called "Rune," and they called "Rid of the cars," and you're going to take a wrong control of control of the streets of cabularly and automobiled, but in the carside of the cars, and auts, but
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan, I wanistan of my mind," is after the "modic conflict.
The war and the free-controlled a new environments, and a new environment, and we've made a new environments that you can only a models of soldiers and self-matodecolds and self-in-mattledge of the fasters.
And I'd like to see how a simple simple shocked the cabular cabular cabularly from 18999, and to create a dalogue today, and today, and they're going to colony.
But for all of these things, you can get in the prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be missing,
But I do, because I have to do because I have to lose the geography of self-long.
That's my last. What is your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and several times.
Second, right, right now.
I have the feeling that now in the room, and I've been built up here in the spanning, because I didn't have to stop.
I've been lucky, I've got something to the way.
So this is the first time that someone who's the TED stage on the touch, so you can see, so you can have happy to see that I think that I think.
If you were really a few women were really explaining when I got to tell me that I don't need to twitter.
I also think I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds, because I can change 10 seconds.
And it didn't have any chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I wanted to make them sure it wasn't wear.
So the most difficult thing is to pullovered to pullovered my head, because then you're going to do, you're nothing to do with my head.
In order.
Why did I do that now?
It was personal.
Now, it was hopefully as personal as this picture.
It's an idea is a powerful, but it's also a surface.
I just got to have a changing your opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never really never really never a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographically, and I told me, and I fit in the hair and with my hair.
And then, from Operations or the wrong bridge, or the wrong brunch of two days ago, there are very few opportunities, and there are very few opportunities, and our surface -- although there's affective, and it's impact on our lives, and it's impact on our lives influen
To being a loser to be honest for me today.
And I'm stage on this stage, because I'm a model.
I'm stage on this stage, because I'm a high school, and I'm, and I'm a sexy My My Mal girl.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always standing up, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How will you have a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that means that doesn't mean.
The real reason I was a money, is a medium is a mattery and maybe a really important explaining what's the same thing.
Now, in the last few century, we have sharked, we've been a healthymetrically defined by the reason why we're biological programmed, but also as a big, but also finally, and it's a high-in and high-in and high-in and high-h-h
This is a same thing for me. And it's a supply for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audienceptic. And maybe some maybe some maybe some maybe, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Small. Li, Tyra. Li Wen Small. Li Wen."
And I'm going to comment, I'm going to be affect. Sacher.
But I have to share with you, I have to share that in 2007, a very experience of NYU all Models on the nYU all the money, and every single money, and that was booked by 67, and that was only 2007, and it's not just 2007.
The next question that's always said, "Can I said, "Can I'm a model, if I'm a multiple?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls really like to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be.
You can be a presidentin of the U.S., or the next Internet, or a ninja-Herzchirurg-Herzchirurg-deter, because then you would be awesome, because then you would be the first thing."
If they're still a great dead, "No, no, no, no, I want to say, "No," I'm going to say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility and you couldn't have the cows of American business or the business or the business or the next sky.
And you say that you're going to be a model, you'd like to say that you'd like to tiny you want to win.
You can't confluence it, and it's not a career, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, because of the idea of the other than heart of the other than heart distress, because it can only do it.
If there's a photograph, and you can just return it into a nice, and you're going to be a nice, and you're going to go to the cameron, and then you're going to go to the legs, and then the legs, and then the arm, and then the poverty, and that's going to the poverty, and then the arm
It looks like this.
Hopefully more comic than that.
That wasn't. I don't know what happens.
If you're going to slide the school, and a few jobs, you can't have a lot of jobs, you can't say that you're going to be a lot of the U.S., but in the United States, "10 years," you're going to look at the world," you're going to looking at the time you're going to looking.
The next question that's been told me is, "Who are all photos.
And yes, so pretty much photos are retirely a little part of the story, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is the first photo, and that was doing that, and that was also the first time I was also the first time I was a bikiniode. I hadn't even my periode.
I know that's pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just looked at a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm at the day.
My friends had to start with me.
This is a pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Phooting for the French vogue.
This is what I'm in the football team and in the V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not a pictures of me.
It's constructs and it's constructs of a group of profession, from Have and Make-up coasts and photographs and photographs and stylists and the piece and the public and the public and the public.
Okay, asking me, people are always asking me, "Car you want to do things?"
Yeah, I've never meters that I could never method I've never met, but the things I'm going to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it, and we're not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge and a day and a day, and I went to a laws and I had forget my money. And you gave me the camer.
As a teenager, I went to my friend, a fire, and they were able to a red law, and of course, and of course, we'd have a red line, "If you had a power," and we could do, and we could do.
I've got this cost of my exceptions of my exception, and not because of my personality and there are people who are people who don't know, and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and they were filmed, and they were 85 percent swars and Latinos and latinos and leatinos and latinos and most of men.
It's live in New York,000 young,000 young, men and Latinos, "Who's not the question, "Who I'm going to ask me?"
It's like, "How often, I'm going to start? When I'm going to stand?"
And I found my rights for this talking about this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-year-year-year-year-year-year percent of their body.
The last question is, "How is, how is it's a model of model?
And I think they expect that they expect this answer: "If you're a little bit of the harm, and you've got a little bit lucky, you're very happy and fabulous and fabulous and fabulous."
And Backstage, we're answer that maybe this education.
We say, "It's really greative, so much to work with creative, and it's dead with creative, inspiring people."
All right, but it's just the story, but it's just the story, because what we never said, "I never saw what I never said, "I feel that I never saw in the camera is, I feel like, "I feel safety."
And I feel like to feel after every day, because I have to think about my exploration.
And if you ask yourself, "Would I be happy when I was happy when I was going to have thinner couple of legs?"
And then you should make a few money, because they've got the thinner, because they've been the most districts and the coolest harmots and they're the coolest clamots are the most women on the planet.
When I was always been a very hard to tell me very difficult to care a very difficult thing to do is really honest, because a lot of unfortunately, and I felt very uncomfortable to me, and I got all the benefits. And I got all the benefits." And I was going to be the point." And its it
It was very difficult to be a very difficult, a result of difference, and race of the biggest nutrition when I was one of the largest network.
But I'm also happy, and I'm also going to take you to do this, and I think it's great that I've been able to do this, and I've been able to do this, and I'd been able to tell you about 10 or 20 years, because then I wouldn't really excited to tell you how I don't really have my boy.
If you take a little bit of this talk, then you're allowed the power of the image of the imagination in our own successes and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never forget the grandmother, I never forget that is never forgets that are in the exilience, "Son, list.
But who never would never be like a gaddafi revolutionary revolutionary."
It's almost two years, for two years, since the libysche revolution of the waves of the waves of the waves of the waves of the egyptical revolution.
I spent a lot of other libyers, inside and a half and a half libyens to a torn, and to a tyrannyrannyrannic revolution to start a tyrannic regime Gadaffis.
And there was a big revolution.
Junge, libysche and men and men are stood in the first rule, the end of the regimes, the end of the regimes, and social generalized such air.
They've been instance, they've been provided by using the brutal dictature Gaddafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the most farmers, until the most wests.
And finally, after age of six months and free months,000 tox,000 tube it's almost 50,000 tyrane and the tyrances.
But Gaddafi has a big cities, a large corruption of the tyrannei, the corruption and the corruption and the course.
Four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannic regime syrannic regime, the infrastructure and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The consciousness and the challenges, I realized how many other women, I women, like so many other women's civil society lybrate, and we've been able to do with democracy and national equality.
And so, 200 organizations were during and unmediately, and in Benghafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After three years in the exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasmiasm, I started to the themen capacity, human capacity, human education and leaderships and leaderships.
With a wonderful group of women, I found the peace of women, I women, a movement of women, a movement of women, and it's a lot of different lifetime, it's public store the public stronger.
I met the paid for a very difficulty, a very difficult environment, a couple of polarized. A polarized by the egoistic politics of the egoistic politics of dominance and exploration.
I was a literally a satellite of peace and women and women and women and women and citizens, and a law, a law, a laws that every citizens, and the right hands.
At the end of our initiative about our initiative.
Women women women,5 percent of the National Congress in the first choice for 52 years.
But long, but it's sure every day, the euphories and the whole revolution, and the whole revolution, we wake up to new new news.
And one morning, we wake up to the money to the money, and Sufi-based Mozi Grane.
And one other morning a message about the message about the murdership on the American bothers and the message.
And again, against the Earth's came out of officients.
And really, we're looking at the heart of the milize of the milize of the milize of the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the laws and laws and laws.
Our society, we've been involutionary of a revolutionarized by the ideal and polarized by the ideal and principles, social Greater, social general skills that they had to start without the same thing that they had to do without.
Intolerance, exploration, and Rache and Rache, and Rachecones of the revolution.
I'm not there today today today with the success of our records of our remote and the choice and the choice.
So I'm a lot of today today, when a nation that we've been missing the wrong choice and the wrong decisions.
We've been looking at our priorities.
Because the choice, the choice, or satisfy or sure of sure.
Have the reason white lister and the change between female and men, and men and national peace and national values?
No, she didn't.
What is it?
Why is going to be further and society and dominated by self-dominating the dominance and the dominance and the dominant, and the dominants, and the women?
Maybe the women didn't have the only thing that was the female, but the female values of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the m
Our society needs a national dialogue and consumers, and consumers than they've been brought the polarization and decision and decision and decision and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative connection of the female of the female, quantitative connection of the female.
We have to stop in the name of the name of the name and a day of the roach.
We have to start in the name of the middle of the middle of the gnade.
We have to develop a female discurs that are not just going to do the followed to do it, but also to do it, but also together, collaboration, collaboration, collaboratts, a conclusion, a conclusion, approach.
These are the ideal that's a committed a visual lybia, to make peace to make peace to make peace.
Because the peace has a alchemy and in this alchemisty, it's about the feminists and maskulines.
This is the real retirection.
And we have to do that, we need to do it before we do it before we do it sociopolitical.
After a person from the coran "Salam" -- Fried "ist the word "istence of the barmers,"
The word "Sem" and again," and it's all over against the same Aradition," and it's the same as the word "Mymbolized "Mother" and symbolized the whole feminists, the whole feminal humanity and the whole path, the whole path of humanity and the path
And that's exactly like the embryo, which is so necessarily, completely nutritional power of the middle of the middle of the middle of the entire existence.
So we said, "My Gnade, "My Gnade all things."
So we said, "My Gnade, "My Gnade ago."
Maybe all the guns of the gunst of the gnade.
Thank you.
When I was a little bit, I thought, and I was the best of the world, and I wished with the long "Nothing" on the long.
And I was very proud.
In school, we looked at the story of Kim Il-ship, but we didn't really much about the world, extremely, America, South America, South Korea and Japan our fine.
While I was often asked me, I thought, I thought I'd think I'd think I'd spend my whole life in North Korea, until the time.
I saw years, I looked at the first time, I looked at a public he thought, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family wasn't work, and I had to live yourself.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter of warf with a colleagues of a college.
And it was like, "If you're going to be here, our family members are not longer, because we've been forget for two weeks.
We're going together and our body, and our body, and we're soon as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well.
I was so highly horrified.
I heard to heard about it, I heard about that people in my country.
I went to the bothofully, and I went to the bad, and I didn't know anymore.
A living woman less woman, and a board, and a board, and a high school in their arm,
But nobody would half of them because all of them because all of themselves, because allowed to care their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big character in North Korea.
At the end of the end of North Koreaner of the hunger of the victims, and many more than just because they're just because they're just because they're just because they're just because they're just a lot of tree.
Instead, the cases were always been holding so that's all the way to get me to the lights, extraordina on the other side of China on the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the
I always asked me why they had no lights, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors.
This is the river of the river, which is part of the bordership between North Korea and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and Ch
As you can see the river, the river, and it's very simply north Korean the river.
But many sure.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't tell a lot about how I can tell you that I can tell you that I can tell you that I can tell the hungernot to China.
I thought I was thinking that I'd been done by my family would be done.
I never thought that it would never thought it together together together.
In China was very hard to live in China was a young girl without family.
I had no idea of what the life would be a north corean flying his life as a northern Corean, but I realized that it's not just extremely hard, but also very difficult, but also, but also, because it's very hard.
So I lived in strong, I'd believe that my realized that my real send, and you would have a bad send to north Korea back to North Korea.
One day, one day, my larger alptraum, when I was asked by the Chinese police and in the police, and in the police.
Someone who was to be a north Korean, so they testing my chinese, so they test my chinese and asked me.
I had this kind of afraid of my heart, I thought of my heart.
Would anything eventually, of course, I couldn't get a little bit of appears.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I was able to control my life, and I felt my feelings and answered the questions.
After they were asking with the exception, a remote, a case, "That was a false.
It's not a north Korean."
And they walked me. It was a wonderful.
Some North Koreaner in China in China in China in China, but many, many of Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police.
These girls had girls.
While they were expected, they were suddenly finally finally finally finally finally international pressure.
These north Korean didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, incredibly north Korean in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be involved or public, or public, or public story.
Although I had a lot of my river, it's not going to be a lot of other north Korean.
It's tragic that North Korean their identity and hard to survival.
And after they've learned a new language, and work in a moment, can be found their head.
After 10 years of the hidden, I decided to South Korea, and I've started to go back to South Korea.
I've never been able to southern Corea, a larger challenge, when I thought it was thought it was thought it was.
English was so important that I had to start to learned language, my third language.
I've been took the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all corean, but inside ourselves, we've been developed together,
Identity a identity crisisisisis.
Is Is Is South Korean?
Where are I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no lands more, that my home, that my home.
Although I didn't have the southern Corean life, I didn't have a plan.
I've been ready for the attack of the university.
I'm going to be a new life, I would have been a little life, I was a bad called a bad called a bad called a bad.
The north Korean business that I started to send my family, and as a street, and as a streets, and as a streets, and as a streets on the country.
They had to fast as possible, so I started to planning their flight.
North Koreaner has to be an incredible streets to their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible, the limits between North Korea, Ironically got a plane, I was to China and I was going to China and I was going to China and I was going to China.
Because my family doesn't have to talk about 2,000 milities, I had to suffered by China and then after Southern Asia.
The busyclist, and week, and we've been expecting more met.
Again, when the business, a chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the existence of all, and started asking questions.
And I didn't understood chinese, I thought I was going to be able to get them.
When the Chinese represent my family, I decided to him, and I told him that they were doing it, and I was told her attention.
He looked at measured measured, but happy, he was happy.
We did it created it to the limited, but I had to get all my money to border to bordership to borders of Laos.
But even after we had the boundaries, my family inhabily inhafts, because of illegal limited.
After I had a money and short-driven, and I was paid, my family inside of a months. But I was in the city, but I was inhabily in the mainstad of Laosa.
This was one of the largest running my life.
I had done everything to family to family to family, and we were so close to the family, but my family, just family.
I went down and I went out between the police and the police and trying to try to convince my family, but I didn't have enough money, but I didn't have enough money or money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked me to asked me to a man, "What's low?"
I was completely surprised that a friends.
In fact, in English and with a words and I explained my situation and without a bank, and without a bankomat, and he was to a bankomat, and two more money and two more money and two more family and two more family and getting out of the prison.
I thanked him from all of the heart and asked him, "Why do you?"
"I don't help you," he didn't.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The most popularly before, symbolized for me took a new hope for me took a new hope, and he showed me the northernity of free friends and the supportunity of free and the supportunity as the hope, the northern Earth, because the northern Earth, the north
And finally, after our long journey, and I was my family and I replained freedom, but the freedom.
Many north Koreanered by their families, and soon as they get in a new country, they're not going to start with little country, they don't have a money.
The international community can help us to help us to the English lower, the education and many mountains and many mountains and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of us in contact with family, and we're staying with family, and we're going to change the money, and we're helping the hard, northern Corea.
I had a lucky, so much helpful and inspiration in my life, I hope that I hopeful northern Corean successful northern Corean success.
I'm sure you're going to see more successful north Korean who are going to see the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a bit.
I don't tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very well, very well.
It can't talk about it, but he's communicating a kind of the best rather than some of the best rather than that might not.
Remi know what love is love.
It's participants, and it's expects, and it's unknown.
It's not gone. He's not going to the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences, and you're just going to tell you, you never told you.
If he remembers of our childhood, when he was not even trying to remember the still, I remember a thing: how little thing: how little bit about how wonderful thing, and how wonderful thing.
Samuel is 16. He's great. It's very good.
He's a absolutely amazing memory.
but he also has a soul.
It can't remember if he's not remembers, but he remembers, but it remember the publicly public longer, conversation that we had been able to be four, as he was four, while he was four of all of the most public bubble on my arm.
Don't hear about it?
But many people don't true too.
And in fact, because their understood because it's not in the society of normal paste, they're often, they're often.
But what my heart, and my heart and my soul, and my soul, although that was the case, even though they didn't have been an oddddddddddd that they were able to be an extraordinary -- autistic and autistic and autistic and autistic and autistic and autistic and
Now, for the ones that are not so confused with the reefused with the carism" is a complex function of the brain, it's a complex funication that's social communication, and sometimes the learning skills.
It's also extremely different than sort of different than Samium is so different than Sam.
And the world's going to be a new person a new person autism, and although it's one of the most fastest growing evolution, there's a profounding developments of the world, there's no known as well.
And I can't remember the first time I'm not remember, but I can remember, but I can't remember.
I was borning three years old, when my brother, and I was born, and I was born, and I was a new weeks in my life.
And after a few months was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play how it didn't really interested in fact, and it didn't really interested in me.
Remipped and regular world, and he was in his own world, and he founded with his own rules, and he founds like the smallest things like a cars in a room, and what's going on in a room, and all of it.
And when he was older, he was different, and the differences were different.
But behind the wutanted to the Frust and the nevertheless and the nobodyactivity was a really unique: a regularly, a junge, a junge, a junge that had never seen a human, who never saw a human, who never money.
And it's an extraordinary.
Now, I can't afford to find out that there was some moments in my family moments in my family, moments I wish I wish I wish I wish I'd be exactly like I would be exactly like I'd be.
But I'm going to go back to the thoughts that they've led me to the distribution, communication and love, and Individuality, and I don't want to understand that this is not going to be a thousands of normality.
Normality about beauty, the beauty, the difference, and the fact that we are not different, and the fact that we're not significant.
It means that there's a different kind of represents.
And if I could just a thing to tell you could say, and then you must be a collection, you don't have to be normal.
You know, you know, you're awareness.
Because, autistic or not, the difference that we have a stories we have a stories of us have a story of us, and in all the stream, and in all the stream, and the ultimate open-pocial.
The chance to the size of the scale and walls and walls in the moment where we're trying to be another.
Please, you don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgalized us with editor and neurosuriosity, with this photo on a projectile photo on a projectiled and a million seconds of a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and see the world, and see the world, but a million pictures, but a million pictures per second.
I'm going to tell you a new kind of photography, the femto-Femto-Fotography, a new approached that they can actually make time lights of light in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the absities, or without a <unk>-ray or without a <unk>-ray body, and we can ask our body, and really, and really, and really, and I'm going to ask you with "Kamera.
If I'm going to take a laser, and I'm going to a million switch, and it's more femtoseconds -- that's more femtoseconds, I'm going to be a million times a million timeter, and that's going to be able to do this project, and that is going to be able to being this proj
So if you take this projectil, this project, and it's going to take this fire, and it's going to take these photones in the flew up in the flew?
What's lights in time?
So this whole events.
So you think about it, you think that's actually less than a nanosecond, less than a nanoseconds -- so light to make this streets -- but I'm going back to the lights -- but I'm going to see the fictor, so you can see the light.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financial.
So in this movie, so much, so you can show you what happens to show you what happens.
The Puls, our projectil, we drives in the flying with a photones, and it starts to move a poton, and that's a bright.
A part of the lights outside the table, and you see these table, and you see these expandings.
Many of the photones, the last past few lastest past, and exploding the rivers and exploding different directions.
As you can see, there's air.
While you're going to be the waves on the table and while the table and the reflexions of the reflexions of the reflexions of the focused on a few images.
If you take a practice projectility and we take the same streets and the video, and the video, and the video, you know, you know how long you know how long you have to see how long you have to see the film.
A day, a week? No, a year? No, a whole year.
It would be a very long-long film -- from a long-long projectily projectily.
And how does it look like a still-Fotography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like if you're a piece of piece.
I mean, it would be like this, the nature of nature, a photo matter, but of course, but of course, but of course, our eye, of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that when you'll see that if the lights, you're going to remain the lights. They're not going to remain.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and the light in their lights and after after after after after a few seconds.
So in the future, if these femto-camera in your camera in your camerahandy, it could be able to be able to make a supermarket, and you can go to a survey, whether it's not going to touch it.
So how did my teamera on MIT this camera?
So when you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you have a photographically, you have a very little billion light, but we've got a billion times more faster than your cutting matter than your career than your career.
So we're doing this project, we're going to send this projectil, and we're going to show you the simpler synchronization and retained to you, and we're retirements, we've got to tell you that femto-making these femto-digure.
And we can take all of these roohdata and doing things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other helling us to make us feel like, but how would it was a new soupercovery for a career for a care of superher?
The idea is that we're doing something light on the door.
It's going to go down into the room, a part of it, a part of it, and then reflecting the door, and we could reflect them back to the camera, and we could use these more simplic action.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built it.
Links, you see our femto-camera.
Here's a puppet, and we're going to leave the light of the door.
After our distression in the "Nature Communication" was published by Nature.communication, and they've been involved by the animation.
We're going to get these lights, and they're going to get away, and they're going to get the package, and then you're going to be able to get a little bit more of the photones, and then we're going to get the lights, and then the lights, and then the door, and then the door, and then the door, and then the door
And because we have a camera, which is so fast is so femto-camera has a unique camera.
It's a very good time, and she can look at the world, and it can look at the world.
And so, of course, we know, the door, but also the door, but also the door, but we don't know what we don't know what we don't know what to do.
Indeed a laser, we can take a rock, we can take a rooh-boh-boh-making, but if we see a lot of these images, but if we're going to dozens, and they're trying together, and they're trying together, and they're trying together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit about what we can do is we can see the lab, and we can see the practices, we can build the collisions, and we can see what's going to see what's going to see in the course of the course, or we can look for survival lights.
But because of the blood and well, and the tissue, of course, it's why it's why is a well-footography, now, now, and now thinking about Femto-Femto-footography professional process.
So, as well, we can also have a scientists, and we can't have been a scientists, and we can also a collection of the ultra-connection, and I realized that all of these gigabytes that we can't just collection that we don't know the scientific education that well-cation.
But it's happening here.
If you look at this waves under the waves, you see that the waves, you see that the waves.
The waves to move around us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've been able to take a lightness in light, we've seen, and instein, and instein's a picture incredibly.
The reports, the events in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, so you can do the camera in the camera, so you can depend the relationships, so we can use these translationships.
So we're going to do this photography, or the medicine, or the medicine, and we're going to be able to hopefully, and we've been able to hear the data and datails on our website, and we've made it.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our opportunities.
We don't meet every neighbors, so that we don't have a lot of ways, but we don't use the same public places.
I've been trying to share with my neighborhood and shared to share things like applon, subjects and crossss and crossss.
The projects, the projects from my questions, how much men's pay?
How do we stopping more things without us to stop sitting?
How do we leaderships that we're going to share the landscapes and understanding better?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so that our communities, so that our communities and tears and trees and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea is going to be huge effects that are hundreds of years, hundreds of years, beds and trees and trees, and I'm talking about a city, and I've always mic.
I think any time, every time, if someone, there's no planet, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the city of the city in America.
I live in the narrates, and I've been thinking about how I could do it. I thought I was always thought that my life for us.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, and she was suddenly and unexpected.
I thought about death, and I've been thinking about a big disease for my life, and it brought me to me to me in life that are important.
But it's hard to me, these silence, this silence every day.
It's easy to lose to lose and lose together and what really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I've left a huge huge amount of the huge, and I wrote a huge, "Bevorite, I want to be a piece: "Bevor, I want to be a piece of the crosssssssssssssss
I wasn't sure what I was able to experiment, but I was experiment, but the next day, and it was always been filled and they're always further.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the people who written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to die, I want to be piratrically piracy."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to stand up the International Datums of the International data."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to sing for million people."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to plants."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to live "netzunabhancy."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to still my arms."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to be someone who's a cavallery."
"Bevor I want to be, I want to be myself."
This is a sense of place, and it was reliable place, and the hopefull place and hope and dreams and dreams, and the laughters and during the hard time.
It's about knowing that you don't know that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighborhood and in a new way, and it's a new way.
It's about place for basically remember and remember and remember what we're most important to us, and what we're growing and change ourselves.
I made this last year, and I've done hundreds of last year, and I wanted to build a walls that I wanted to build a walls, and I wanted to build a colleagues, and now, and now, and now, and now, like arranged in Lustral Africa, South Africa, S
We've shown how much power our public places, when we have the opportunity, our voices, and more with other voices.
Two of the most valuable things we have time and the relationships, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever before, the things that are the right both the right briefly and think that life is a little briefly.
We're often going to talk about death, and we're talking about death, but I've been thinking about it, but I've been able to think that the idea that the death of the things that we're most strong.
The idea of death is a death of death.
Our common slow place where we can show us what we're doing is important. And with more important. And with more possibilities, and we can help us to share our hope to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us better places, they can't help us to hel
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me with me with mathematics. A particular problem for everyone who's a particular mathematics are consistently mathematics are like companies.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to tell you today today, today, what I do.
Tances is one of the most activities.
We're going to be in the middle of most of the ballett and soups and soups, like you're going to see how you're going to see how you see.
At the ballettles a very big massive amount of capacity and abilities and abilities and possible eventually a basically a genetic componential eventually.
Traural represents newurological stories like Parkinson's long-long slowly, they also do this extraordinary, and it's also a ballettual ballettual.
And over the years, you've done a lot of research.
But even though, there's a year, there's a million people who live in this disease, and they have to live with the unexpected symptoms like symptoms, symptoms, and other disease, and so that disease.
We have to have the progressing objective message, and the only way to know if we have to know if we have to know if we have a single time we have a question that we have answer that question that question.
<unk>rustrator is that there are no relationshipson and other eviomarker, so you can't have a simple biombs. The best thing that there's this 20 minutes.
You have to him in the clinics. It's very expensive, and it means that means, and it's never made the clinical studies.
But what if patients could do that if patients?
That would be a collaborator in the hospital. What would be patients, what would be able to do?
It wouldn't be a teensive hospersonal.
It costs ends 300 percent, 300 percent, in the newurological action.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods, with the methods that we're trying to reach other, because we all are all, because we all have to least, virtuoids like my least Jan Stripling.
So here's a video of video of video of video.
This is what happens in the healthy, when someone spreading a state. We can look at the coordinate ourselves as a stimulate, because we have to look at all of these stimmorgane, and we all have to coordinate the genes, and we all have the genes.
And as Ballets, it's enormous amount of exercise.
Think about how long a child, how long a child, until it.
And so we can record the position of vibrate stimming stimming stimulate, and as the grandmorgane, and the stimmorgane.
And so the both of the both appearance for example for example of stimulation.
We're always see the same symptoms.
It's true, sword, sword.
The language is actually going to be a language, and that's an example, and that's an example.
And this expects that can be able to be able to be able to be able to digital microphone, and presence, and presence, and the present, combined with new large-shaps, and we can do with new learning with new learning.
How do we can't clear with clinical minds? Well, they're not both of the neurologists.
And so, the infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly. There are exactly the voice are not by experts.
So you can be done by the way.
They're very quickly, you're very quickly 30 seconds.
They're very big and we know what that means.
If there's something extremely, you can also use it in big way.
And this is amazing goals now we can now reaching.
We can reduce logistic skills for patients.
Patients don't have to leads in the clinics in the clinics.
We can make objective data, we can related to the objective data.
We can do a couple massive massive studies for clinical studies and it's first career, and it's realization of the population of the population.
We have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the hospital for the disease before it's before it's before it's before it's possibility.
Today, we're doing this direction, we started the parkinson's son's son's simson's simson's simson's sunction.
With Aculab and patients LikeMeeee, we want to take a very high number of stimulate enough extracting enough exciting for the exciting for the exciting of these goals.
We have rooms that are running the divated a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, without parkinson, can be a little parkinson, to get a few center for a center. I'm going to give you known to familiar with familiar with family in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people say,000 people say, you can't say who is not who is not who isn't it?
What's your samples?
What happens is that the patient's going to be a called a called the parkinson't have to parkinson't.
Some of them, you might not be able to create it.
But we collect a huge database, under different conditions, and the circumstances are interesting. The circumstances, because we're in order to make these outside, which are the real markins.
At the time, their 86 percent decade?
It's much better.
My sler thanasis -- I have to love it, because he's got to be fantastic worked -- now, it's also functioned about the mobilfunctioned with the projects that we are incredibly in 99 percent.
I call this a process of a process.
And that means that people can do -- the people can do with the cell phone, and people can take the test. Parkinsoninson's might be able to take their doctor, so that you can take the rest of the disease of the disease of the disease of the disease.
That's what we do.
Thank you. Max Ladies, my daminate,
Thank you, Tom.
So here's what I live in Kenya on the southern Rand of Nairobi national parks.
In the background of my father's the cows of my father and the national park.
The Nairobi national park is in the south of southern Southern. It means that wildlife is that wildlifebras the park.
The red lions that are the solutions, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that were killed. I wake up. I wake up. I found it was a great bad. It was our only box. It was our only bull.
My struggle, the stamm of the massai, we believe that we came together with our animals, and that's why we got our animals.
I learned to eat.
Our warrior is called morans. They're created our struggle our hearts. They're in the heart of this problem.
And they killed the solutions.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobian.
And I think there's a nairobi- National Parkinobi-down solutions.
In my voice is a boy between six and nine years, and nine years, and it was a cowed to me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Lions. Lions for fire.
But then I realized that we would help us to help us to help us to see the solutions that can help.
But I didn't go on. I didn't do it.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a bird.
I wanted to think that the solutions, I was standing next to the cow.
But solutions are very clear animals.
You see, you see the birds and go back. And then you go back. And they're going to go and say, you know, and they're still going to still young.
And they killed and killed our viety.
One night, I watched the case. I love with a fackel in the hand around him, and that time, and that time.
Lions for a light for a light that's moving.
I had an idea.
I was working on a little boy, I worked all day in my room, and I took a new room, and I took the new room, and I had took me together. And I had took me a lot about the day. But I had learned me.
I took age old carship and a rolling a motorrad. The left. The left. The left or left. It's right. It's blind. It's blind.
And I was a words to a switch to a light and out of lights.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a capse.
And then I built everything.
The solar panels the battery that battery, the battery, and I called the relationship. I call it a transformator.
And the direction of blind.
You see that the births, because of the outside, because of the solutions.
And so this is what it looks like that, if they come to the solutions.
The lights blinks and the solutions and the case, I was about the case.
Thank you.
I've been so that we had this installed and since we didn't have a problems.
And then we heard our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost their animals, and she wondering whether I could asked me whether I could installing the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
And so, I've got houses in the neighborhood with the lights and they're really good.
My idea is now used to use in all the cenycy, even for other robusts or leoparning or leopards. The lights. The lights.
My supporting to a stip to a stipendium on a stip, Brookhouse in Kenya, Brookhouse in Kenya, and I'm really excited.
My new school, and I'm going to help using language and hards and recording.
I even my friends with my friends with my friends and we're going to show the lights, and I'm not going to show the people, and I'm using the people, and I'm using them.
I just a year ago, a boy from the Savanne, who was high school. I looked at Flight, and I told me, and I'm going to sitting in a sitting in a sit!"
And here's what I call it.
I thought with airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a great thing to be airplane and pilot. That's my great dream.
I've been invention, but I can representation, I can save the cows of my father and the solutions, and we can live in common, side, side, without side, without street.
Ash<unk>n. In my language. In my language: I thank you very much.
You know, you know, you know, it's like you're a story like your story,
So you've got this stipendium.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What is the next thing?
So my next exploration, now I work on a electrical caunch. Amaune. Amune?
Yeah, I know, electrical cases are already long, but I want to have my own.
You've already trying to try to try to do it, I'm trying to give you a bit, but I was trying to give a slept.
All of the beginning is hard Turder, you're a little bit of a bit of a best.
We're going to take you to your friends, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm old enough, a camera in the hand, is Fotography, but I want to share with you today, I want to share with you today with you 15 of my favorite.
There was no kind of director, no style, no chance too bad a picture. Not a picture. Not a piece of the reflection.
Tour, to be honest that most of the most predictions were done by the tourists.
My story begins when I was in New York, and my wife, and my wife, and my wife, and my daughters at my poverty, and we were at the first time. We were at the '7th of 57th.
And so, we were later, we were in New York and so we decided to same picture.
