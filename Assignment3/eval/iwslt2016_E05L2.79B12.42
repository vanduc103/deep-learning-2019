When I was 11 years old, I was 11 years old, I was brightly heller.
My father heard on his little bit, gray, gray the news of the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was quite happy to be very unusual, because it wasn't really unusual, because it was depressed.
He called "The Taliban,"
I didn't know what that means, but it made my father, very happy.
"Well, you can go to a real school," he said," he said," he said.
I'm not going to forget about together.
One right school.
The talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, and I spent six, and it was girls, and it's girls.
So I've been able to remember five years, I started as a boy and starting my older sister who didn't go to a home, and I've been going to be a home school.
Only, we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way took a different way, so that we could never get to where we went to where we went to where we went on.
We've been able to put our books in the income to go out of the way we'd just going to go out.
We've been in a house, we were able to a house in a little wood in a little waiting room.
In the winter was incredibly, but in the summer, it was incredible.
We all knew we all knew we all knew our parents, students and our parents.
In the sudden, the university had to be able to make a week, because the taliban consumption.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Do they asked us?
Who do they know where we're going to be?
We had afraid, but we wanted to school.
I had a big happiness in a family in a family, in education as important and taxters.
My grandfather was his time.
At the outside of a collective provinced provinced provinced, his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- to school, and he was understanding his father.
My given mother was teacher.
This is it.
Two years ago, she went to the ruhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here's the first in his family, who was ever a school education.
For him, it was clear that his children would be a picture of his daughter, but also his daughter, drops, drops.
He looked like a much larger risk of his children's not going to send his children.
I know that I know that I'm going to be in the Taliban sometimes, sometimes the struggle of our life, from our lives, and the perspective.
I had good luster, I had to stop, but my father said, "Thter, you can hear me. You can lose all life.
The money can be done. You can be done. You can be in war.
But one thing is going to be you always going to be here. And even if we're going to stay with our blood for your blood for your blood for your blood voice, we need to do that.
So -- want to still you still want to still?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that's been destroyed by decades.
Less than 6 percent of my age of my age of my age, a higher than the seconds than the second, and if my family, and if my family, I would have a strong for my school education.
Instead, I'm going today, as a stold Absolventin of the Middlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather who was my grandfather who was done by his family, because he was to school, because he was to school, one of the first greatest, one of the first greatest.
He's not just talking to my high school, but also with my high school, but I'm the first woman who was the first woman who was dangerous.
My family believes me.
I've got great dreamily, but my family has greater trees for me.
So I'm global embassads for 10x10, a worldwide of women.
So I've been able to help SOLALA, and maybe some internative in Afghanistan, a country where the country, a country where the schoolbook, in school book for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students to my school with my school with great earliers with great earliers.
And to see how their parents and vacters for her parents, as I'm going to be able to me, and I'm going to be able to make the resistance.
So as Ahmed. That's not his face, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Apping a month, his daughter and heimself on the home and they're at the home and they're going to be a bombs on the streets.
And when he was at home, he came up with the phone and a voice, and he was going to be him, if he was going to send its daughter, they would try to school.
And he said, "Thead me, if you want to be when you want to situation, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughters and overhelming and overholds."
What Afghanistan, I realized something that I realized something that's most often in the West often, most of us, most of us, most of us, the success, and he's a father who's a father who's successful.
That's not hotter today that our mothers don't play in our success.
These are the people who are hundreds of the people who are starting to a lot of possible and talking about a lot of their daughters.
And we've been able to go to school hundred girls -- because it was the girl -- because it was yes.
But today, every three million girls in Afghanistan about three million girlbank.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how we're going to be the changes.
I'm noticed that the change of during the change and reports of the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I'm in my school, and their parents, and their parents that they're going to be a lot of parents that they're going to see a lot of future, I see a lot of future and a long time.
Afghanistan is for me to me, and the hope and the unknown possibilities, and I remember the girls that girls.
And so I think they've got a big dreams.
Thank you.
All I'm doing, even though -- my life -- my life -- my life -- my life in Africa as young man.
In 1971 to 1971, I see young, I'm not -- I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Kenya, algeria, algeria, algeria, algeria, algers of technological countries.
I've been working for a painting project, and every single project that we've been able to stand on the legs.
I was turning out.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're going to be good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we were all we started to faster.
Our first project, which is my first project, "Ripples inspired by the Zambi" inspired, one that we wanted to show you how food was approached to show how food.
We came with Italian south Asia, in South Asia, in South Asi Flussi-Flussi-Flussi-si-shape the approaches of the announcilian tomata and covers.
Of course, the answer to the answer to the interest in this, so we paid them, so we've been doing it for working once.
We were amazing that there was so early in a so early talalent talent.
But instead of asking why they were nothing to say, "God, we just said, "God."
"Great," justice to save people to save people sambias of the returns out."
Of course, all of this wonderful in Africa.
We had these practice tomates. In Italia, they were so big, they were so big.
We couldn't believe it and said, "Sambian, like, "Sambshood economy."
When the tomato, and rotates, about 200 nights, about 200 nights and asked everything.
We said to the Sambian, "Oh God, the Nilpfering!"
And they said, "Yes, we have no country, we don't have a country."
"Why didn't you told us?" "You've never asked us."
I just thought we were so great, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did what the Englands, which was the Englands, I saw what they did. After I was done.
We felt the nilms of the film.
You should see the inside -- you should see the uncomfortable African people that we didn't know anything else.
They should be the book "Thead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, she's a sambic economist.
The book was published 2009.
We have the opportunity of African continent 1,5 trillion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has told you what this money.
Lesply, you just have to book.
Lesen you have a African, which we have an African.
We're the most people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are two species, and there are two species, and we're patriarchal.
Bothers are from the latines from the latines, which means "pather" means "Father" means.
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalian: I'm going to treat a different culture, they would be my children. "I love you."
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone each one other culture, they would be my diction.
So this is white people in Africa, "bwana," Chef,"
I was growing up when I was a book called the book, "Small," from school," he said, "Small," he said, if people don't want to be help people, then they don't want to be able to help them in the back.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help of the help.
Today, the morning of the herror, and this conference, a stab on the ground and asked a city and asked a city, "Can you're not neocolonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react with people, and he was going to be a system called company, which is never going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to remain the personalists of the personalists of the picture of the picture of the personalists of
What you do -- you're doing the mouth.
You're not going to be a community with ideas, you're going to set up with the sky.
We don't work from Bross.
We're hit in Caf<unk>s. We're hit in Kips.
We have no infrastructure.
We finally finally found out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person want to find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can tell someone else.
If these person doesn't like to do?
The passion for the own growth of person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own growth is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge, because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea has not the idea, but it's not the knowledge.
A lot of years ago, I had this instead of statting instead of saying, and people say what they're doing and people do not being to be? But not to be? But not in community? But not in communities.
Let me give you a secrets.
There's a problem with community.
And they've never been part and they're never going to be public, which they're going to see what they want to see what they're going to see what they're looking for opportunities.
Planation has this blind flind.
The clearly people who knows the community of the community because they never seem to be able to open up.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, social infrastructure that are not existed.
A new mountain has to be able to do.
This is the house of the company, the house of the bedrooms that you're going to be in your caf<unk> and in the caf<unk> and in the caf<unk> to help you help you help you to try to try to try to try to transform your passion.
I've been in the body, West-Australia, trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to
I promoved to the time and tried to the time and trying to get out where we're going to do what they're doing other things they're doing.
And so I just love in the first year, and I had just been able to help the first three days. I him. I him. I him. He was Maori. He was Maori. I him, and I him, and I him, and I him, and I'm going to get to organize the organization and doctorize the resta
I heard this fish, I'm going to work with these wonderful thunfish, and I don't have to buy for 60 cents, but to sell you, but to Japany for 15 dollars, but after Japanese for 15 dollars, and I got told me, and I said, "Hey."
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government, the government, "How do you do that?
How do you. I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and hope."
So -- -- so -- so the government, "Make it again."
We've done it in 300 communities.
We've got 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are in a sense of a sense.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, one of the story, story, story, a few years ago.
Peter pressure was philosophy professor, before he was businessor, before he said, "Peter said, Peter said, planted in reality, in reality and the reality and the economy and the economy and the economy and the economy."
Planation is the death of the entrepreneurs.
So you build christch without know what the coolest human cool, and you want to know what the christch of their energy and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get this to get this.
You have to be able to help them privacy and privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them to help them, and they're going to be hard.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
For the presentation, you have the most applesentation of the morning?
<unk>respected people. The evily people.
I want to say that entrepreneurs are the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial Revolution -- nich-based revolution -- and suddenly, fuels, and suddenly, and systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not suddenly.
The consistent massive machine is not sustainable.
The friend of the instruction is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we have to look at them, we have to sustainably replace, holds, holds, and we can corresponding them with them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will these technology for the green revolution? Universities? If you're going to be?
The government? If you're going to be.
It's going to be a company. And they're doing it now.
I'm going to read a food in a future of a food-magazins ago.
There was a group of experts that were in the future of experts town the future of New York in the 1960.
In 1860, they came together and speculated what was going to happen in 100 years, the city. The Short of New York, the city: The city wasn't exist.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, and they said, if the population in this tempoint in this tempoint, they needed six million paths to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to finish.
Because they went on the mistakes in the mistakes.
1860, they see the bad technology that life looks like life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001, there were 1001 cars -- 1001.
The idea, one other technology, a different technology, the renewing. There were little factory in the back of the back of the back.
The probably, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing that is that they need to be able to be able to be.
They didn't come and talking to you.
The next thing you have to do is absolutely engaged and empty and empty service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth of the entrepreneurs.
From the little biggest company, all of the smallest company, three things that needs to be selling the product of production, the markets, the financial production and the financial and the financial.
Do you like?
We never met a single person who can be selling a little person who can produce the same time and make the money.
It's not existed.
These person was born.
We've been looking at the 100 iconically, and we looked at the world, Carnegie, Westinghouse, edison, Ford, Fords, Google, Google, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Google, Yahoogle, Google, Goo
There's just one thing that allowed all the ways that allowed all the world, just one: No, just one: No one: No one person.
Now we're going to teach 16-year-old companies, and we started to start the business of Richard Branson.
Nobody's "ich" and 32 times "wir"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody's green a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we create a community that will have a small company that has a little bit of the minter of Caf<unk>s and Bars and Bars and Bars, and you're going to do for them to do what someone who's going to do with this gentleman, which is the eposal.
What can you? Can you do it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you can you remember the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't you." "Mo you know that I think I'm going to figure out?"
We accountabilities.
We have groups of volunteers that can be the companies that can be involves, and people will help them to help them out of the middle of the middle of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economy of the economy and the economy and that economyeconomy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be the wonderful, alice in the wonderful.
The penn State University is a Doccentination -- a docentination -- increasing in communication -- in communication.
I had afraid of the fear.
It's not afraid of these students with their great brains and their great big books and their great books and their great big books,
But as a conversation, he was developed, it was like Alice, when they looked at the camped, and a covered a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I was talking about the students, I was amazing. I was amazing about the thought they had thought that they had this wonderful, and I wanted to discovered that other wonderful.
I think to open this door to open this door, it means to open up.
We need to have an amazing communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the largest problems, like the largest problems, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and I don't believe it's nothing in our conservation. I don't believe that it't believe that it't believe
But these great conversation, if our scientists, if our scientists and engineers and engineers.
So scientists and engineers, clearly, clarifying us.
I want to show you a few answer to you, how to see it, we can see that we can see that the science and technology, and the technology and the technology and planeously.
The first question that you have to answer is, is, right?
Says us, why you're going to be relevant for us.
If you don't just believe that their trade, but they say that you're also saying that you're also telling us that they're also under the massive structure in our cooks, because they can understand opening opening up and understanding opening.
And if you do that, what you do is you do is you do is you remote.
Afterwards are a hands to understand your memory.
If you could use your doctors and pretty and pretty much, but why don't you just do not understand why and time, what is it?
Our thoughts to make your memory, is not the same as their nive.
As astein ready said, "Maches, things like this, but not just as possible -- but not just as possible."
You could tell us a little bit about eye, you can tell us about eye, without anything else.
A few things are invisible, for examples: examples, stories and analogies, and analogies.
And if you're presented, then you read the story of the story.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stichpoint."
What happens when someone else? One of the other people, and there's a different place, and with these points, and with these points.
A follow, it's not just slowly, but also slowly, but also too much on the language of our brains and you're going to be fast, we're fast.
These example of geneview of genevievieve Brown is much we're going to show you that the special structure of the trade of trade, it's even the inspiration for the only design of the effect of the effect of the effective design of the effecture of the effecture of the effecture.
The trick here is, a single simple sentence of sentence, which can use the audience, if it can be lose to the fact that can be lose to the fact that can also relate our other senses, and our other senses, and it's also a deeply a deeper and terrible.
These are just a few answer to help us to help us to see these door and the wonderful and the wonderful and the technology and technology and technology.
And there's the engineering I've been able to make me remember that I want to make the <unk>Nerd in me, I want to make anything with a same contact with a same connection.
And there's a science of your science and your stories, and your multiple of the relevance, so that's the audience, and that's important, and multiplicated the ganzee, and it's incredible for your work.
So scientists and engineers, if you're solved that same me, clarifying me.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy, you can films of humanity in Syria.
With a handy, you can take a message and a protestaction in Egyption in Egypt.
And with a handy, you can take a song, you can be a sounds of SoundCloud and collective.
All of this is possible.
I'm a year in Berlin.
Let's go back town back in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people for change the streets and the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989 and imagine that all these people who had these people who had changed on the handy in the tasky in the task.
Who is a handy, a handy of this?
You're high.
You're going to high, you high, you high!
You're high. One is a blackberry, a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and I've changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about.
These are 35th, 35,000 information.
Rohdata.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.Kommission of a direction.
These direction is called the right line of the reline of the terms of the moment.
These direction is that every phone in Europeancial in Europe, every Internet, every Internet, a bandwidth, a bandwidth, a bandwidth.
Who are you going to be? Who is it?
Who's a send of a send?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All these information are going to be six months to two years to two years to two years of your phone or your phone netanbievement, or your Internetanbieved.
And everywhere in Europe are people on Europe and said, "That's not going to want."
They said, we wanted to say that imagination doesn't want to be.
We want to be self-based self-digital time, and we don't want to be the phone and the Internet and Internet, and we need to store all these information about us.
There were applies, Journalists, Priester who said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to want to be."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of blinds and said, "Freedom and said, "Freedom."
And some people said, somebody could be the state of 2.0.
The state was the secrets in the ostonishing in Ostermany.
And I asked me to be able to work if that really works.
Can you really, all these information about us information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone called my phone called the Germany telecom that was the largest phone in Germany, and I asked them, and I asked them all information that I'd all information that I'd all information about me.
And I asked her and asked them, and she asked her, and I got no right answer. Nur Lea Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bl
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life, because it's my life.
So I decided to make a decided to have a survival because I wanted to have this information.
But the Germany telecom said, we're going to give you this information.
At the end of the end of a comparison.
I'm going to send the terms of where they all send me to send me.
Because in the twish of the mouth of the mouth, the emotion of the E.U.
So I recovered this half of the environment.
And on the CD was this.
Three-830 colors information.
I was first, I saw it, and I said, it's hold a huge datei.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this datei.
So I was a little bit skeptic, what should I start with this?
Because you see where I'm going to see where I'm going to make what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want to go to the public and I want to go to the public.
I want to make them audience.
Because I want to show the people shows what I want to show you what it means.
So with time, with open Data City, I've data City.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reincooms and outside, you can imagine and back and back.
You can do any step that I do every step, after all the time.
And you can see how I can see how I can see from Frankfurts, and how many an approach to close to the stuff.
And that's possible to this information.
This is a little bit of a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just so I'm going to go to my wife and we talked together, and we talk to each other.
And then I'll go to a few friends, and they call apart.
And after a while you're going to go and you're going to have this huge communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they're going to be able to go to bring them to bed.
You can see all this.
You know, you know, you know, you know, like the leaders are the leaders are the leaders.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect defect defined evolve a society, because you know who's going to talk to who are going to talk to a email, which is possible when you have access to these information.
And these information are going to be information for months, in Europe, in Europe, in Europe.
So as I said, we started to imagine that all of these people in the streets in the street in 1989 cell phones in 1989 cell phones.
And the state of the state that the state that was happening in the distration of the state of the state of who had never been the leaders, and then maybe that would never happen.
The case of the bliner might have not states maybe not states.
And also thought that the case of the ice of the ice.
Because today, information and companies like so many information, like they want to get to get to warriors, and often, online and often of us.
They want to be able to required our lives, and they want to be able to remain that all of the long time.
But even self-dimension and a life in the digital time in the digital time.
But you have to fight for the self-profits today.
You have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you say, you say, you're going to be a value of the 21st century, and that's not old-century.
If you go home, you say, you're going to have your edge, because companies and state the possibility, they have to specific information, they don't have to do it.
And if you're not believe me, you're asking your phone called the information that they've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, you remember your handy, you remember the self-down, you have to fight into the digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituitual, snows, snows, bridge, bridge.
So the city planer, and the city, and the name South Central South Central South Central, and it's changed in South Los Angeles, when it changes in South Los Angeles, which is going to be wrong.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituitude, snows, snows, bridge.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food of the food Wouth Central Los Angeles, the home of the drive-thrus and the drive-bys.
The comic is that the drive-thrus, the drive-thruses than the drive-bys.
People are south Central Los Angeles,
The fathery is in my fourth is crate in my fourth is corner than about 15 miles, which is about 15 kirca, which is circa.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how to feel like you wouldn't have access to healthy food if you had no access to be able to see any time you've got out of the house that negative effects that has been the best earthquake effective earth.
I'm going to buy role bought role and sellings like buying a book.
I see Dialysecentary seconds like starbucks like starbucks.
And I'm going to stop that this is that this is.
I realized that the problem is the solution issue.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no longer, I had no luster on 45-driving appledge to get a pesticides in presented with pesticiously in presented.
So I plant a food forest, I food a food forest.
It's a piece we call the parkanline.
It's 45, it's 45,
The thing is the thing that is, it's the city.
But you have to start to fight.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I have to kep it."
And I decided to hold it in stands like this.
So I got and my group, and my group, and I started together, and we started together, and we started to plants, and own program, soon, soon to plants, so that's all the program.
We're a kind of imagination collaps, and we're going together and from all these social signs and from all the city, it's completely freezing and everything we do, and everything we're doing.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then somebody else.
The city came up to me and he got to me practical a practical practical and said that I had to be a rich best of the right a richer.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A richeral approaches of food processes in the food of food, which is you're going to be able total?
And I thought, "Cool. Hermany."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times, Times, Steve Lopezzzzz, and I spoke with the city and talked to the city of Green Green Green Green Green Green, and we were able to reach 900 difference.
We thought you'd go to the hands.
My city strate rather than that, and she said that they're supporting and love what we do.
So why should they do that?
L.A.A. in the United States, most of the United States in the city of the city.
They're bridge 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flower to plants to plants to plants.
Why would they find that, they shouldn't it?
and when you get a plant to the plants, you're going to get 1,000 sample.
With boat bohs in the value of a dollars and green owners in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my holds, I say, I say they should be able to build their own food.
His own food is like to build their own money.
You see, I have a considered in South Central.
I wanted to go. I've been there. I've been there.
And I'm sort of this imagined reality to be the only reality of other people who were fabricians, and I fabricians.
You see, I'm a artist.
Garden is my graffiti. I plant my art.
And that's the same as a graffiti coasts, the walls, I'm going to beautiful, I'm a park.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of piece and the plants are my dreams and the trees are my dreams.
They would be surprised what the Edbod can use it as a line, if you use it as a line.
You can't imagine how he's amazing a sunlume, and how they're touching people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my gardence for the instrument for the result of my fourth and the result of my fourth.
To change the community to change the community of the ground of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wondering how children are going to be influence.
Garden is the therapists and care of the therapists that you can do, especially with the city.
And you know, you're going to get exploration.
I remember this time when these mother came up with this mother, it was college, it was circade, and they were in my garden, and I came out and I came out.
I'm sense, I'm sense because they were there, and I said, "Wis you have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been able to see when I saw people were so close to me and hungry, and I was just asked me to do that, and I asked me, people ask me, you're not going to be your fear."
And I said, "There's no, no, I don't have afraid.
And it's the street.
That's the idea.
I want to take it back, but I want to take it back to my healthy, I want to take their health."
At the other time, I was a garden in this obsession in Downtown L.A.
These are the guys who have been helping me to decide the laster.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how they're influence and how they've been planting with her mother and how they've been plants, and it was great, and it was great for a moment.
Green Green Gardens have been plants.
To our environments came together, and they were so 50 people, and they're all the volunteers.
If children carbon, it's eating children.
If they're tomates, they eat.
But if they're nothing to get to get to be able to get the food and body and body and body and body and body and body, they're just eating whatever you're just going to eat.
I see young people who want to work, but they're going to stand in this thing -- I see -- I see, I see in this thing that's exactly on the path that they're not going on the path.
The garden, I see the opportunity where we can train the children can train their communities to care their communities to get a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who know who knows who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carververton Carverton Carvers.
But if we're going to change the edbothboard, we're going to do this.
So this is one of my plans. This is one of my plane.
I want to share a whole rock of Garden plants, where people can share the same blocks in the same blocks.
I want to take siffscontainer and they're in healthy caf<unk>s.
So you don't understand me.
I'm not talking about cost of snow, because costs are not going to behavior.
The comics of neighborhood is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about it, people who are working, and children from the streets, and they're going to get the streets and the honor and the honor, and when you're going to be able to own food, and if you own food business.
So what I want to do is to do is to do is to do here.
I want to be able to be ecological rebells, Gangster, Gangster, Gangster.
We need to represent the picture of Gangster.
If you're not a gangster, you're not a gangster.
Ganger is, you're going to go to sell, right?
And let's be the weapons of your choice.
If you want to make meet meet meet meet meet meeting you in the meting rooms and make a meting room and a meting, where you want to talk about it.
If you want to meet meet meet you want to get your garden, in my garden, so we can put some sort of plants.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite songs in the entire oxford English wordsnollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "It's unlikely politicians."
Although, although, a time in 19th century, and it's a better definition, "It's someone who's someone who is someone who is someone who is an approach, independent, program or last, and his success, and his success, and his success, and his future.
I have no idea what's "speakeral" is.
I think, I think, I think, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians that they're trying to control the language.
For example, for example, for example, the British plament, not the British plament, the problems of the debate.
And that was actually back to the mother on the mother of a man whole name from the outside of the name Brass Crosby, who was in the plament.
She was him in the Tower of London and he was mutray, but he was mutigrade, he was mutigrated enough to be able to remain so much in London, he was so much in London, he was so much in London, he was so much in London.
And just a few years later, we find the first news for the first news for the first news, "so strass."
Brasses are relative to the English word for bad for bad.
But that's not true. It's not going back to a return of press.
But to show you how words are, and politics and politics, I want you to take you to the U.S., when they're just going to be able to reach the independence.
You saw the question of what you're going to be the state of Washington, the state of the state.
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leadership of a republic Nation?
This was in Congressed in the Congress is in the Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible advances.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouversion, and other, and other, and others, and others, and again, and again, and again, and again, and other people of America's Well, Washingtonhington.
Not so that's not so much.
Some people wanted to call it a king him.
They thought that was aware.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king time,
It would have work.
But everybody was incredibly distribution because these debate 3 weeks.
I've learned the days, I've learned that still write the same issue.
The reason for the population and the long time, and the longest house was that the senatenators.
The representations didn't want to be that Washington, and they didn't want to be him.
Cings, and they're going to be able to bring himself,
They wanted to be the most prediction, the most powerful, the most painful title.
This title was "President."
President. They don't existed the title. He was invented. But he means that someone's a transition.
This is something like the prepare of a Jury.
He had no larger than the recording "Anovation" or "Auffer" or "Auffer."
Sometimes there were president smaller colonial community and governments, but it was really an infinite an unmembers of titled title.
So this is why the senates him.
They said, "This is smile, you can't call it president.
This close to the classrooms, and they're going to make surrounded citizens.
Who will take him, if he's going to take a thumbsident of the United States, like President of America?"
And also, after 3 weeks, the senates of senatism.
Instead, you know, you know, the title of the title of the message of the monkey, but they wanted to be absolutely clearly involved in their own persistential respects and methods and methods.
You can learn from three interesting things.
First, I think that's the best -- until now, I don't have the senatenating whether the senates,
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title of the same thing. It was only going to be able to be able to do that the senates.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says that something temporary -- -- -- -- -- -- you know, you're also 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title "President of America's not so that's not so clearly not so sounds like this, right?
This has been able to do something more than 5,000 nuclear pollinators that he has the largest volcan economy of the world and a photographics and a physical done.
It's actually the story and story has given the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the
And so the senat on the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the
They have a respectable title of title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of the sense of the same thing.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147th.
Because they want to be sound like the classrooms with the 5,000 nuclear pollinating and fighting and fighting and violume.
So the end of the senat and the representance, because no one has lost a house, because nobody's going to be a word that you're going to be the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can do with, and with what you can do with.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality and the reality, but actually changing the reality words, the reality words of reality words.
Thank you.
So I got in a laster with about 50 rebelling about 50 rebelling approach to Dipper, a 19-year-oldaric surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I thousands of my black converse half of a couple of country, and I couldn't even have a rockets and firements that I couldn't even see.

And what's suns can do is to make the Dihad-ganger than for the plament and a choice and a choice, and I'm going to do with the Slogan: I'm going to do that." I'm rich."
And trying to use these campafiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosi
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and they're going to take a project called "Runny" in the police, and they're going to take a wrong control of cabular cabular cabular cabulatories, but in the street.
I want to look at me, like the conflict in Afghanistanistanistanistanistanistan conflict,
The war and the free-driveness, and the free-controlled a new environment, and models and models that you can only a models that you can only a models and self-collected a models and self-holds.
And I'd like to see how a simple simple simple simple characters of cabulative appell from 189, and to create a diction today, and they're going to be able to colonial developing their designers.
But for all these things that you can get in prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be missing missing.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to be lose the geography of self-dofield.
That's my last. What's your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since a model.
For 10 years, right now, right?
I have the sense of the space here in the room, because I had a uncomfortable spanning this clothes, because I didn't have to start to start to remember.
I've happiness, I've been doing something to the way.
This is the first time that somebody on the TED book on the TED books, so you can see, so I think you can see.
If you were really exploring women were really exploring when I wasn't need to say that now I'm not going to go to Twitter.
I also realized that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very shortly, because I can change the way you think about what you're thinking about me.
And that's not too everyone.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I wanted to make them song.
The hardest part is that the pullovers, because the pullover, you'll be able to do all of you, you're nothing about my head, so you're nothing about my head.
In order to order.
Why did I do that now?
That was personal.
Now, it was hopefully like this picture.
And one image is powerful, but an image is also open.
I've just done your minds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been in reality.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photograph, I felt so everybody in the hair, and I'm going to figure out this guy.
And then, from operations or the wrong bridge, which I was going to change two days ago, there's only very few possibilities, there's only very few opportunities, and our qualities -- although it's own in the surface -- although it's a bigheless and unefulful
Fromless to be honest for me today, today.
And I'm standing on this stage, because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a hope, and I know that woman, and we call this breaking a sexy girl.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me to ask me to the real way.
The first question is, "How will you to be a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means," but that means nothing.
The real reason I was a model, a model, a mathy and a message and maybe you're going to ask you, and maybe you're going to ask you what this experience.
Now, in the last few century, we have beauty and young and young and young and young, and we're biological programmed, but also we're biological, but also, but also hospital, and highly highly.
This is a result, and it's a result, and it's a result for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are people in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Joan Smalls."
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to be in your model-dressive.
But unfortunately, I have to share that in 2007, a very classroom in 2007, the NYU all the models on the walking on the running, and that was booked by 67, and that was books, and that was books.
The next question that will always said, "Can I'm going to be a model, I'm going to grow up?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know that's not because it's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to be able to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can you be? You can be.
You can be presidentinciative or the United States or the next Internet or a ninja-hour-hour-dinja-dinja-dinja, because then you'd be the first."
If they say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I want to say, "Who," I want to say, "Who I say, "Whole."
Because I have no responsibility and you might be the chefrediction of American vogue or the bird or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next svented misle.
To say that you want to be a model, you want to say that you'd like to say that you'd want to tell the Jackpotto the lotto.
You can't be able to be able to be fantastic and it's not a career.
Now I want to show you 10 years, I want to tell you 10 years, because of the constrate, because there's only just a heart, it's just just just just just just just just just just fold.
If there's a photograph, and you're going to be a nice, and you're going to be a photograph, and then you want to be a photo in the cameron, and then you go to the legs, and then you go to the arm, and that poverty, and then you go to the poor, and then, and then, and then, you go to
It looks like this.
Hopefully more comic than that.
That was .... I don't know what happened there.
If you've done the school and a lifetime, and you can't have a few jobs, you can't be a lot of saying that you're going to be presidentin of the U.S., but you're going to be able to go to go to the Unward, you're going to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to
The next question that I'm often asked me, "Who are all photos retuse?"
And yes, so, so, all photos are going to be a little part of the story.
This is all the time I didn't do that I didn't even do that, and that was also true to make a biciniode. I had not even my periode.
I know that's going to be pretty personally, but I was a young girl.
So I just looked at a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is I'm at the day, I'm on the day.
My friends had to stay with me.
This is I'm on a pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama.
This is I'm with the football-timeam and in the v-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
They're constructs and there are constructs of profession, from Have, from Happeared by Happing and photographs and photographer and stylists and stylists and the advantage and the advance.
Okay, as next to ask me, people ask me, "We're always asking things?
Yes, I've been able too many 20-cm-claws I'm not going to be able to get things that I'm going to talk about, but the things I'm going to talk about it, and we're not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge and a day, and I went took a launch of money, and you had the clothes. And you had the clothes.
As a teenager I went on my friends with my friends, and they were able to turn it on a redirement, and of course, and of course, and it turned to be a power, and we could only farmers, and we could go on.
I've got this cost things, I have to see my personality and not because I don't know because of my personality and there's people who are not because of their personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were filmed in the last decade, and they were 85 percent swarence and latinos and latinos and mostly men.
It's live in New York only 17,000 young, men's not the question and latino, "Who I'm going to ask, "Who Is?"
So what do I'm going to be a lot often? When I'm going to start?
I found my rights for this talking about this talking about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the U.S. and these numbers. And these numbers.
The last question is, "How is it, how is it, how do you do it?"
And I think they're expect them, they're going to be a little bit more and more and being a little bit longer and be happy, you feel very happy and fabulously happy and fabels."
And Backstage, we're going to be answer that maybe this impression.
We say, "It's really good to save so much, and it's greative, and it's greative, inspired to work."
And it's true, but it's just the half of the half of the story, because what we never say, "I've never been talking about the camera, I've never feeling me."
And I feel like I'm going to think about my exactly every day, because I have to think about my exact.
And if you ever ask yourself, "What do I be happy when I was happy when I had thinner legs and behind?"
And then you should make a few models because they've got the thinest legs and the longest legs and the most coolest coolest clamothes and they're the most coolest women on the planet.
When I've been able to ready to me, I've been very difficult to tell you a real picture, because one of the picture, I felt very uncomfortable to say, "I'm going to say, "I've all the piece of a stackle, and I was going to believe it." And I was a stacked to being a stack
It was very difficult to be hard to a suppressive of crazy and race of open, and race of the largest non-scale.
But I'm happy and I'm happy, and I'm going to be here, and I think it's great that I've been able to do this, I've been able to be able to be able to tell my career, because I'd believe that I wouldn't be able to tell my career, I wouldn't mean, I't know how
If you take a little bit of something with this talk, then we all have the power of the image of the imagination of the implications and mistakes more.
Thank you.
I've been forget the words, I never forget that, I've never been in the exilience of life, "Son," "Son," and the coldafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widafi Wid.
But who never matters like a gaddafi Revolutionary."
Now, there's almost two years, since the libysche revolution is inspired by the waves of the waves of the mass of the massive in the olderly in the Egyptian revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, with many other libyers, and outside Libyens to start a day of the Zorn and to start a revolution and to start a revolution.
And she was, she was a big revolution.
Now, liby women and men and men stood in the first series, the end of the regimes of the regimes of the rule of the freedom, for the range and social generality.
They have a result of mother, they're using the brutal dictature of the brutal dictature Gaddafis.
They have a start sense of solidarity, from the farm, from the farmers, until the southern.
Finally, after a time after a months of six months and almost 50,000 tyrants, and we're going to stop the tyrane and the tyrane.
But Gadafi has a big big big big big big big basically, the guyrannei, the reason for corruption and the reason for course.
Over four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannian regime, and the infrastructure, and the moral structure of the lybic structure of the lybic society.
The consciousness and the challenges, I realized, I realized how many other women, like so many other women's reports. We're going to build a civil society and never matched approaching equality and neverthational matters.
And so, in 200 organizations were during and unmediously in Benghazi in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in the exility, I got back to Lybia, and I started to the single Enthusiasm, I started to the topicshopshopshopshops and leadershopships.
With a wonderful group of women, I found the peace of women, I women, a movement of women, leaderships, leaderships, and it's public life, and it's public.
I met the paid, I met on a very difficult environment, a environment that was always strength, and a environment that was from the egoistic politics of dominance and exploration.
I just put a popularly initiative of the peace of Libyscher, and I'm going to be able to reach a laws, and it's a laws to be a laws, and to be the right hands to be able to give you a person and countries and countries and countries and countries and
In the end, our initiative and successful and successful.
Women women women in the National Congresses in the first choice in the first choice.
But long, the eye, but the euphories and the euphories and the entire revolution to the whole day, we waiting forests.
And one morning, we wake up the money, and the money and Sufi-Green and Sufi-Gres and Sufi-Gres.
In another morning, we got news about the morning of American emerican employees and the message.
And again, again, the efficients were the efficients of the army.
And really, we're going to expand the milixed evily of the milixed countries and their power and their power and their power and their power and laws and laws and laws and laws and laws and their power.
Our society, information, involutionary, polarized, polarized by the ideal and principles and principles and principles, social God, social Gendership.
Intolerance, exclusion and rocks and rocks of the following the following of the revolution.
I'm not here today today with the successful today with the successful literally and the choice and the choice.
And I'm a lot of time today, I'm here today, and the wrong choice and the wrong choice and the wrong choice.
We've been able to replace our priorities.
Because the choice, the choice or security or security or security or security in Lybia.
Have the research literally and the way between female and men's brought and national female peace and national factor?
No, it didn't.
What is it?
Why is our society is going to continue and dominated by self-shinance politics of the dominance and the exclusion of men, and the exploration of men?
Maybe the women didn't have the only thing that has been the female of the female for the female of the middle of the middle of the same thing.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consumption of the educational education, the choice, the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the
Our society needs to be the qualitative requalities of the female of the female, quantitative requirement of the female.
We need to stop the name of the name of the name of the tag of the roach.
We need to start to start to make the name of the middle of the brain.
We need to develop a female distribution that wouldn't just going to be able to do it, but also too, but also together, instead of rather than the concerned Conkurs, instead of the classroom.
These are the ideal that are a visual wars that needs to reach peace to reach peace to get peace to reach peace peace.
Because the peace has an alchemy and in this alchemy and in this alchemistry and masculines and masculines.
This is the real reasonable remarkable.
And we have to do that, we need to do this, before we do it before we do it.

When I was small, I thought, I thought that the best of the world, and I wanted to use the lower.
And I was very proud.
In school, we've been able to look at the history of clim Ilamed, but we learned that America, out there's noisy, South Corea, South Korea and Japanese fine.
And though I was often asked me how the outside of the outside of my whole life in North Korea, I would spend my whole life in North Korea, to a time.
I saw that I saw the first time I saw a public history, but I thought, I thought my life in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to live.
But in 1995, my mother brought my mother was a letter of a collegin.
And there's a stood, "If you're going to be five families are not going to be families because we've been for two weeks.
We're going together on the ground and our body are soon as well as well as well."
I was so hard.
I heard to heard the first time that people in my country in my country.
I went took on the box, and I saw something that I saw something that I didn't know anymore, I can't solve.
A living woman launching on the ground, and a high school in their arm, and approached to be able to be able to be able to be the face.
But nobody would hold it because all of them, because all of these things that were going to be able to care their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hungernot in North Korea.
At the end of North Koreaner's millions of the hunger's based on the victims, and many otherwise, because they're based on the grass, and bags.
In fact, there were always been highly, so that's going to be able to do all the way to the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the Ufers, where we lived.
I always asked me why they had been there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the river, the river, the river, the part of the border between North Korea and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China.
As you can see, the river, the river, and it's very simply north Korean's the flight.
But many smart.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't say a lot about how I can't believe that I can say that I can say that I can say that I can tell the hunger's districtions of the minds of China.
I thought I thought I was a short time of my family, I would be done.
I never thought that there's 14 years together together again.
In China was very hard to live as young girls without family.
I had no idea of how the idea of how the life would be a north Korean Fling, but I would be able to extremely hard to be very difficult, but also very difficult, but also very hard.
So I lived in countries that myself that my reality, and you would be able to return me into a horrible sends to North Korea.
One day, my greatest alptraum, when I was drive by the Chinese police and in the Chinese police and in the police, and in the police.
Somebody recently, North Koreanerines, so they test my Chinese chinese and asked me to ask me to ask me to ask me.
I had this kind of afraid of my heart, I thought I was exploded.
Would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ab
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I thought it was to control my feelings and answered the questions.
After they were asking them with the experience said, "That was a false.
It's not North Koreaner."
And they'd go. It was a wonder.
Some North Koreaner in China in China in China in Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had girls.
And even though they were able to expand them, they were able to free international pressure international pressure.
These north Koreaner didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, incredible north Korean in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be able to be able to be highly high-trespite history.
And though I had been lucky, I had not happiness, there's a lot of other north Koreanans.
It's tragic that North Koreaner, and it's hard to fight and hard to survival.
And then they've learned a new language and working on a moment on a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the most piece of the hiddence of the southern Corea, and again, and again, and again.
Mich in South Korea, non-down, was a larger challenge, when I thought it was thought it.
English was in South Korea, I had to learn to learn to learn to learn.
And I started to get the great difference between North and South Korea.
We're all the coreaner, but inside the inner, we've been able to do this, we're all part of the part of 67 years.
I'm going through an identity.
Is I'm south or North Korean?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
All of a sudden, there was no lander that could be my home.
Although I was the approach to the south Korean life, I had no easy.
I've been remembering me for the university.
And I was a new life when I was able to recently, I was able to pick up a bad.
The North Korean Behind, the money that I started my family, and as a piece of my family, and as a piece of family, and it's a place on the country.
They had to fast as possible as possible, so I started to plane.
North Koreaner has to be an incredible streets on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to over and South Korea and South Korea, Ironically took a plane, I was a plane, and I was going to take a plane and I was on the north Korean borders.
Because my family language, I had to live them, I had to southern Asia, and then I had to Southeastasia.
The business is that the business and weeks, and we've been able to be almost.
Once, when the bus once, a chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the extraction of all, and he started asking questions.
And I didn't understood my family, I thought they would be family.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided to tell him, and I said she was going to be him, and I said they were dreams, and I was six.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, he believed me.
We've got to make it up to the laotic border, but I had to break the money to break the border of Laoscontrolls.
But even after we had the bordership, my family inhapped my family inhapping the border.
After I had money, and the small and shortly, my family inside of a months, but I was able to get my family. But I was able to get my family.
This was one of the largest piece of my life.
I had done to make my family to family to family, and we were so close took my family, but my family, just family, just family.
I went down and I went down and the police and the police and the police, and I tried to remember my family, but I had not enough money or money or money or money or money or money or money or money or money or money or money.
I'm lost all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that there's a freezing.
In Broken English and with a words and I was able to create my situation and without a bank, and he went to a bank, and two other numbers and two other northern Korean, and two other northern Korean,
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why do you?"
"I don't help you," he said,"
"I'm going to help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The removed free-driveness, and he took a new hope for me to me, and he took the North Koreaner, and he took me the friends and the friendness of free and the international community of the hopeangenerational community as the northern Germunity of the n
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I repeated, but the freedom, but the freedom.
Many North Koreaner will be done by their families and soon as soon as soon as they go to a new country or even not a money or even not a money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us the Englishment and many mountains, and many mountains.
We can also be able to be the bridge of the people in North Korea and the outside of us in contact with families, and we're going to send them information and we're going to change the hold, North Korea, Northkorea.
I had a happiness, so much help and inspiration inspiration inspiration inspiration, I hopefully north Koreanernanians, with international successful international success.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful north Koreaner on the whole world, and I'm surely on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a please.
Please don't tell me that I'm not going to be normal.
I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good and very good.
It can't talk to you, but he's communicate in a way that there might be a kind of the best speech.
Remi white love.
It's shared to share it, and he's shared.
It's not really good. He's not on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and you're not just tell you that he never tell you a light.
If he's lowders from our childhood, and when he's not even remember that I remember one thing: how little we know about the mind, how little we know about the understanding of the unknown.
Samuel is 16th. He's very good. It's very good.
He's absolutely incredible memory.
But he also has a selective.
It can't remember if he was my chocolate war, but he remembers, but he remembers of the public lower of every songs that we had a four-pod, as four, as four, as four, as four of all the time.
Don't you hear it?
But many people are not true.
And in fact, because their understood because their understood in society of normal valuable version often understood and wrong.
But what my heart, and my soul, and my soul, even though this was that the case was that the case, even though they were not as a case that it was just a case that it was just authorities, they were outside -- autistic and outside -- autistic and outside.
Now, for those of you who are not socials that are not social cars with the mission of the brain, it's a complex faction of the brain that social communication that is social communication, and sometimes learning.
It's also approached in every individual, it's a different than Sami.
And the world's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person Autism and though there's one of the world's one of the world, there's one of the world, there's no known as a history of the world, or health or health or health or health or health or health.
And I can't remember the first time I remember when I'm not remember, but I can remember it.
I was born three years old, when my brother than my brother, and I was so on, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months again, he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and in fact, and actually not very interested in me.
Remi, and regulated in his own world, with his own rules, and he found found founded by the smallest thing about the little thing in a smallest thing in a set of the room in a series, which is what it's eating and everything to eating and everything.
And as he was older, he was different, and the difference, and the difference.
But the woods and the wutanted and the frustrating and the nevertheless was something really unique, a remember, a remember, a junky, a boy, a boy, a boy, a human, a human, a human, a human, a human,
And also, incredible.
Now, I can't live that there was some figure out there were some moments in my family, I wished that I wish I wish I wish I was wished.
But I'm going to be the thought back to the things that they've learned me to think about Individuality, communication and love, and I don't understand that these things I wouldn't want to be thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of the time.
Normality, the beauty that beauty that the differences, and the fact that we're not going to be different, that means that one of us are wrong.
It means that there's a different way of rights.
And if I could just say to Remi, and then I couldn't be a sample and you wouldn't have to be normal.
You know, you're extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a gift of us -- we have a gift of us, and in all the ears, and in all the ears, and in the ultimate open-limative victims of potential.
The chance on size, research and chance in the moment where we're trying to be trying to be different.
Please -- say, I'm not saying that I'm not going to be.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has us with edgs and curiosity, with this photo on the photo on a projectilure of appledge and a million times a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million times faster and see the world, but a million or a million pictures per second.
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography, the femto-Fotography, a new education that they can make time to make time to make time to make time to make time in movement.
And so we can build cameras, we can build the absolutely, and we can look at editors, or without a room, or without a room, and really in our body and really in question, and really in question.
If I'm going to take a laser potentially, and I'm going to take a billion seconds -- that's more femtoseconds, I'm a photones, I'm a photones, and this photones, and this photones, and this photones, and this photones, and this photones, and this
So if you take this projectil, this photones, and it's going to take it into these flashotones in these flashoton in the flashoton in the flashoton in the flashoton?
What's light in time?
So this whole events --
So, think about it, think that's actually less than a nanosecial events, less than a nanoseconds -- so light to return this streets, but I'm going to be able to see the factor of this video to see the factor.
No, Coca-Cola has not financialized this research.
So, in this movie, so let me show you what happens to you, and show you what happened.
The puls, our projectil, we drive in the last, and the photonpaket, and that starts to move inside the finally inside the finally.
And one part of the lights outside the light on the table and you see these exhibitions.
Many of the photones that are last reaching the last last, and exploding the rivers and exploding the various directions.
As you can see, there's air, there's airplane, which is in the flash.
Whiled, as you're going to be the waves on the table of the rainflexions of the rapidly, you're going to see the end of the rivers are focused by the end of the flash.
If you take a <unk>uite project, and it's the same streets and the video back to the video back to the factor 10 billion, you know, you know, you know, you know how long you have to see the film?
Aday, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very slow film -- from a long-term -- from a long projectily project.
And how do you see something still silence of a stillage?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like when you put a sentence in a text.
I'm going to be as if it's like this is a photo males, the photo males, but of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the lights, you're going to remain that's going to stay at the point. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and the light and the light and after a few million seconds.
So in the future when these femto-camera in your camera in your camera in your camerahandy, you might be able to make a supermarkets, and you can remember it's a fruit of it.
So how did my teamera in MIT, this camera?
So when you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you have a photographically light, you have a billion light, but we've got a billion light millions of millions, so you're going to get a light.
So we're doing this projectil, we're going to send this photonism, and then we're going to show you that, and then we're going to combinate these gigabytes, and we're going to combinate these female models.
And we can take all these rohes and make things and doing very interesting things.
So, superman can fly fly.
Other hands can do that, but how would it be able to see a new super-powerful superherocking, and you can see edites:
The idea is that we're going to street a light on the door.
It's going to be able to go back to the room, a part of it, and then reflecting back to the door, and we could reflect these more easier, and we could use these more simplifying the light.
And that's not Science fiction. We've built it.
Links on the left of our femto camera.
Here's a puppeared, and we're going to be able to read the door.
After our after our approached in the Nature Communication, it was published by nature.communication, and they've been able to have these animation.
We're going to take these lights, and they're going to be able to get this possible to the photones, and then they're going to be able to get the photones that are going to be able to reach the lights.
And because we have a camera that's so fast, our femto-camera has some single camera.
It has a very good time, and she can look at the world in light, and it can look at the world.
And so, of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also we know what we don't know what we don't know what we don't know what the dots.
Indeed, we can take a laser, we can take a roh image, we can see that -- how they're going to see the image, but if we look at the image, but if we can use many of these images, and they're going to try together, and they're going to try together, and they're going to try to make avock the different
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit about the lab, before we can use the practice, we can use the cars, we can use collisions, and we can recognize the collisions, or we can see what we can do with it, or we can look forwards, or we can look forwards, or we're looking forwards.
But because of the blood and violum, of course, of course, which is why that really is a way to think about scientists, now, now, now, now, now, and think about female, because a new picture of medical education of medical education of medical education of medical education.
So, as well as a scientists, and we can use a scientists, and we can't be a art, and we can't be a art and I realized that all of these gigabytes, and I realized that all of these gabytes that we're not just scientifically scientifically scientifically avious picture
But it's happening here.
If you look at these waves under the rivers, you see that the waves of us, you can see that the waves.
The waves to us to move.
What happens here?
It turns out that we've been able to take almost in light, and we've seen this image, and one image, and incredibly incredible incredible.
The range, the rest of the events in the world, in the world, in the world in the world in the world in the camera in order to relate the relationships by space and time we can use these relationships, we can correct this connection.
So, even if we could use the photography or the exploration of a new picture of a new data, and we should have been able to remember the medical invention, we all have datails to our website and details.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many opportunities, like our middle of our lives.
We don't meet every neighbors on the street, so that many ways, so many ways we use the same public places.
In the last few years, I tried to share with my neighbors and shared things like tasks and create create create create.
The projects of my questions, how much mine my neighborships?
How do we suffering more things, without us?
How do we remember our memory in the memory and the landscapes and the country?
And how can we share our hope for easily houses, so that our communities, so that our needs and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My sea is going to be huge amount of the hundreds that are hundreds of hundreds of years, beds and trees and trees and trees. I'm going to be a city where there's always music.
I think every time, every time, every time, there's no one parade.
In this city, some of the beautiful buildings, but it's also the city of the world, but it's also the city in America.
If I'm going to be able to do this house, and I thought it could be changed. I thought that my life for always changed my life for always changed my life for always changed.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved very lost.
You've been Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, and she was suddenly and unexpected and unexpected.
I thought a lot about the death, and I felt a big disorder for my life, and I took me to my life, and I needed to be in life, and I've been in life.
But it's hard to me that situde me to pay at every day.
It's easy to lose in the Allday and to forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I was a side of the lose of the line of the luck of the lucks and wrote the lucks, I want to be a sentence, I want to be a piece of the same piece of the piece of a piece of a piece of a piece
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could experiment, but I was the next day, and they were going to go to the wall.
I want to share some sentences that were written by people who were written by the wall.
"Bevor I'd like to be a piracy, I want to be away."
"Bevor I'd like to stand up, I want to stand on the International datums."
"Bevor I'd like to sing for millions of people sing."
"Bevor I'd like to send a tree tree."
"Bevor I'd like to live, I want to live."
"Bevor I'd like to go back to my arms in my arms."
"Bevor I'd like to be a little cavallery."
"Bevor I want to be, I want to be myself."
This is after place that was a place where it was a sense of place, and the hope and the hope of people took me to the laughters and drive me to the wine, and I'm hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and a new and a new way to a new way to a new way.
It's about the place for me, and to create and remembers and remember what we're going to change what we're grow up and change us.
I've done this last year, and I've done this last year, and I wanted to build a collective people who wanted to build a walls and I built my colleagues, and I've been able to build a countries like artificials, and now, South Africa, South African
We've shown how much power our power power of public places, our voices, and more with other people.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever looking at the right thing with the right picture of the right piece of life, and think that life is that the life.
We're often being able to think about the death to think about the death or just recognize that the idea that the death, but I've been one of the death is one of the death.
The idea of the death is using the death to us.
Our common samples of the place, which is the best thing that we can help us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities, and they can help us to share our hope to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to be awareness mathematics. One of the problem for everyone who are consistent with approaches, is that we're going to be able to be like companies.
Nobody knows what we're actually doing.
So I'm going to tell you the trying to explain what I'm going to explain what I do.
Tanzee is one of the human activities.
We're decided to be able to see most of the most ballett and sentence and sentence, like you're going to see how you're going to see the same.
For the ballettle of a very balletically big massive science and abilities and abilities, and ability to have a basic events that could have a genetic components.
Traurs are destroying neurological structural slowson long-son slowly, and that makes them to be a balletting jan Stripling, and it was a ballettuituose.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the treatment.
And yet, there's a worldwide 6.3 million people who are living in this disease, and they have to be able to live with the unexpected symptoms like symptoms that are more living.
We have to measure the projective message, and we can measure the only way to know if there's a single opportunity, if we have a objective massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive matter.
<unk>rouble is that there's a parkinson and other movements don't have biomarker, so you can't just a simple biombs. The best thing there's this 20-minutes.
You have to be able to get him in clinics. It's very expensive, and that means that means, and that's never done.
But what if patients would be able to do this destination?
That would be a hospital tour in hospital tour in hospital, what would be if patients could do that,
It wouldn't be a teureshouse personal hospersonal.
It costs <unk>100 percent, 300 percent, in neurological action.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods that we're trying to reach that we're all trying to reach the senses, in some senses like my person, virtual strike plan Stripling.
Here you see a video of video of vibrating vibrative vibrative.
This is what happens in the health, if someone speaking spreading a stimular balletting, because we can look at all of these voice because we have to coordinate these voice, and we have to coordinate the gene, and we all have the gene.
And as Ballet, it's enormous, it's enormous.
Think about how long a child, like a child, until it's a child.
And so we can use the position of the vibrate vibrate vibrate vibrate, and as the game, and as the vibrative of parkinson.
On the insurance of the instance, you can see an example of unregular voice.
We're always seeing the symptoms.
If you're going to be swareness.
The language will be a list of time, and that's an example, and that's an example of it.
These effects to the voice, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, but with digital microphones and presence, and presence, combined with new line, and that's very much more exactly what we can do with new lights.
How can these tests with clinical message? Well, they're not both, they're not both in Neurologists.
The same thing. The infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exact. The voice is not going to be the voice.
So you can be able to be able to be.
They're very quickly, three times 30 seconds.
They're very billig and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can use it in great big massive.
These amazing goals with this, we can do this.
We can reduce logistics for patients.
Patients don't have to leadership in clinics.
We can do if we can do is data by half-shaped pollination.
We can do approaches of clinical studies, and we can be a clinical studies and first of all the population of the whole population of the population.
We have the opportunity to look for Biomarkers for the disease, before it's before it's before it's too late it.
Today, we're going to do is we start to do the parkinson's the parkinson's sitiative.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of voices to voices to voices to bring enough exciting enough to reach the earthquake of these goals.
We have spaces that are dreams that are divious people on this planets are on this planet.
Everyone, or without parkinson, or not to get a few center to get a few center to a few center. I've been known to fire, I've been ready to be eight hours.
Thank you.
If you say, we're going to say 10,000 people, you can say, who's healthy, who isn't you?
What do you do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients have to be able to patients, whether these parkinson't. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Some people don't maybe it's not to create.
But we're going to sample database, under different circumstances, which is important. These environment, because we're important because we're important to figure out what the real marker for parkinson.
For the time you're going to be 86 percent of the skills?
It's much better.
My students -- I have to love him, because he's so fantastic working on this project -- has now shown that it's also working on the mobile phone works, which is also going to work on the mobile physical works.
I call this is what I call a conservation.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handy and people can do with parkinson, people with parkinson, and they could take their voice, so that you can take their doctor, so that you can represent the hospital.
Think.
Thank you. Max Light, my dams and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenya in Kenyairobi nairobi nairobi national parks.
In the background, you see the cow of my father and the cower and the cower of the Nairobi national park.
The Nairobi national park is in the southern Councility. That means that wildlife is that wildlife, the parkets of every time.
The robusts that are the solution, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that was killed. I was taken on, and I thought it was horrible. It was our only box. It was our only box.
My stamm that the stamm of the massai, we believe that we're going together with our animals and the sky. That's why we got our animals.
I've learned to measure.
Our warriorans. They're going to be created our stamm and our hearts. They're also going to be able to start to be able to do this problem.
and killing the solution.
Here's one of six solution that were killed in Nairobian.
And I think there's something about it in the Nairobi-time national parks.
In my stamm is a boy between six and nine years, and nine years, and it was also a box.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Feuer. Lions for mechanism for mechanism.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to see the solution, but the cows.
But I didn't go. I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to a bird.
I wanted to think that the solution, I thought I was standing the cow.
But solve are very smart animals.
They come to see the birds and go back. Beime, and they go back. But they're going to move, and they're still not, yes, yes, yes, yes.
And they're going to kill our viety and killed our viety.
One night, I wake up the case. I love the case, and I love him, and that time, and that time, and that's not going to be able to solve it.
So solve forwards ago, which is moving.
I had an idea.
She's a little boy, I worked on my room, I took the whole day, and I took my mother radio my mother. At the day, and I had took me to my mother.
I took an old autobattery and autobattery and a motorrad. The right, and you're right, whether you want to left.
And I was best, I was a switch for the light and out of the lights.
This is a little bit of a birth of a courage,
And then I built all together.
The solar panels laws the battery, the battery, the battery. I call it a transformator.
And the right thing that's blind.
You can see that the births are outside, because of the solution, because of the solution.
And this is what it looks like the solution when they come from.
The lights are blinking and the solution, I believe that I was going to believe the case.
Thank you.
I've been solved installed and since we had no problems, we had no problems.
And then we heard our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals, and she was able to ask me if I could ask her lights installing their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I'm installed the lights. They can see the solution.
I've been doing it in the neighborhood in the neighborhood, and they're really good.
My idea is now used to be used in all the cenycle, even for other robust like hyes or leopards or leopards, elephants of color of color.
My invention is a stopping a stip of a stip of the best schools in Kenyse International school, and I'm really excited to me.
My new schools are engaged and helps and helps and helps and airplanation.
I even my friends with my friends with my friends and we're going to be able to show the lights there, and I'm not using the people like you're using them.
I'm just a boy from the Savanne, who was a boy of his father cows. I saw Flane, and I'm going to sit down in a situation.
And I'm going to stand here.
I thought to airplane to airplane for my first TEDTalk.
I'm a big, I want to be airplane and pilotential and pilots.
From my face, I can go through my invention, I can return the cows of my father and the solution and the solution, and we can live without side, side without the solution, without the solution.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I'm going to be very much.
You know, you know, you know, it's not what it's like your story like your story like your story.
So you've got this stips. Yeah. Yeah.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next to the list?
My next invention, I'm working on a electrical caune, a electrical caune?
Yes, I know, electrical cities are already have been invented, but I want to be my own.
You've been trying to get it, not trying to try to get it up, I've been trying to get the trying to repeat, because I got a sleep.
All the beginning is hard. Richard Turere, you're a very special.
We're going to be in every step your way, your friends, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm since old enough to hold a camera in the hand, is photography. But I want to share with you today with you to share with you to share with you.
There was no kind of Director, no picture, no picture, no chance, not even the picture. Not even the picture.
In fact, mostly, most of the most of the mostly, mostly,
My story begins when I started a talk in New York, and my wife and my wife that I was birthday on my daughter, and we were on my arm, and we were on my arm.
And so we've been able to go back to New York and so we decided to same picture.
Now, you can see what you can see, you can see.
When the third birthday my daughter, my wife, "Hey, why, why don't you sabina, and he doesn't make it a father-down, and it's a father-down?"
And then we started to make a picture of tourists, a picture of us.
You know, it's noticed, as universal, as universal freezing free of his camera.
Nobody has never said, no one, and fortunately, and somebody's never done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rice, we wouldn't know how much we would change our lives.
These journey is very hold.
This is just after the 11,1, and I had to explain and I had to explain what happened in the day, which is that a five-old, so that there was a five-old.
These images are much more than just one moment, or a moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a way to make a week to reflectober that time and think about our time and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical, not just physical, but in all,
Because though we're always doing the same perspective of miles, and as they're always new miles, and as they're always seeing the life with their eyes, and how they see it's all about how they see it.
These very intensive time we spend together with each other, and every year we're going to expect every year.
Last, as one of our rice, we went through a rice, we'd place and suddenly, and they're going to show them as a red fluores, they're going to show you what they'd love to a pupping on a pupping.
And she told me about her feelings that she had five-olds that she had five-old on this point of this point.
She said they remember that they remember the heart of the breast time she saw the first time she saw the launch of years ago.
And now she looked in New York after high schools, because they want to study in New York.
And I realized that, the most important thing we're all the important thing we all create memory.
And so I want to share with you to share the idea of an active role in the most impactive role in the memory of memory.
I don't know how it looks like this, but I'm going to be able to see a families of this 15 pictures.
I'm always the image.
I want to tell you about today, I want to get today within the image and care of you, and you're not going to do you?"
Thank you.
