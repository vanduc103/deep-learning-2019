When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clener of the clener fire.
My father hearing on his little roadio running the new roadio the bBC.
He looked very happy, what was happy to do is pretty unusual, because the neighborhood was depressed.
He running, "The Taliban.
I didn't know what that means is, but it made my father, very, very happy.
"You can you go to a right school," he said," he said," he said.
The morning I'm never been doing.
A big shock.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, and I was six, and I spent to school, and I spent to school.
So I was a half years, I five years long as a junny and starting my older swester, not all of your older, not all of your sky.
And so we could go to school.
Every day, we could never found a different way, so that he could never walk out where we went to where we went to go.
We're going to be able to look at the left, so that it was so exactly what we'd like to do.
We were invited in a house, we were in a house, in a small woon.
And in the winter was after, but in the summer, it's in the summer.
We all know that we knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
And then, in the until the difference of the difference for a week of weeks because the taliban being power.
We were never been using how much they knew how much they knew about us.
Do they recording to us?
Why do they know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to do?
We had angry, but we wanted to go to school.
I had great happiness in a family in a family, in the image, and turned into the picture and tills.
My grandfather was his time.
At the outside of a development of afghanistanistan. He's banding his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and it was fathered by his father.
My mother, but it was born, but it was line.
That's what they do.
Two years ago, she went to the rhestands of our house for money and women from the news and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this was the first thing in his family, who was a school, who was a school.
For him, it was clear that his children was a children would be a children, but also his trots, the taliban, trots all rots.
He looked like a much larger risk of his children don't go to school.
I know that I know that I was in the years, I'm even knowing for the taliban, and sometimes, from our lives, from our lives and the perspective,
I was good lust, I had told you. But my father said, "Thter, you can hear it. You can hear it.
No money can be country. You can be in the war, you can be in the war.
But one thing is going to be dirty, and that's what's going to do is, and even if we have to be able to do with our bloods for your bubble.
So -- you want to still you want to still?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country on a country that was the war of war.
Wither than 6 percent of my alters have a higher-shops as the seconds as the secondary, and if my family, and if my family for my shoulder, I would have a women.
Instead of college, I'm here today, as a statement of the Middlebury College.
When I was after Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was invathered by his family, because he was won was taken to school, he was to school, one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the most family.
He doesn't just not just with my heads, but also with my high school, but also the first woman who was the first woman, and I'm going to free-dooting cars.
My family family.
I have great trees, but my family has still greater animals for me.
So I'm a global bottom of the world, a global bottom of women for 10x10,
So I've got to be the south, SOLALALA, and maybe some internat for memory, and maybe in Afghanistan, a country, in the school, and still still risk.
It's wonderful to see how the shoots of my school with great earning all of them all of them to give them all of them.
And to see how their parents and variety of them, and I also my parents for me, and I decided to be able to decided to be able to decisions.
So as Ahmed. That's not being not being a name and I can't show you ahmed, but Ahmed the father of my father.
At the months were his daughter and he's been on the home of SOLALA in their village, and they're going through a bombs and they're only going to get some minutes.
When he was home, he was clean, and a voice, and a voice, he was going to be a stimp, he would be keeep its okay, she would try to try it.
And he said, "There's what if you want to do is, but I'm not going to go to the future of my daughters on the future and more older and more older and overcurities."
What Afghanistanistan, so I've got something that I've been able told you, the most often, the most of us, the most explains that the success, the father, and he's a value of the water, and it's also explored.
That's not today that our mothers don't have a important role in our success.
And they're going to be the most various, the most possible and talk about a lot of different future, and they're going to be able to make its opportunity in a society like the increase of the universe is the university of the inevitable.
Our the Taliban, only hundreds of hundreds of girls -- because it was someone.
But today, everyone in Afghanistan, three million million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so differently.
The Americans are experiences like us, like us are solutions.
If I think that the change is not from daughters and recently, and they're changing the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I'm going to souler in my parents, and their parents that they're going to make a lot of parents that they're going to make a lot of future, and then I see a lot of future and a lot of wall.
Afghanistan is for me to a country and the hope and the uncomfortunity, and it remember every day, and every day, the SOLALALALALALALALALALALALALALA.
And as I think they have great trees.
Thank you.
All I do do do, also, also, I was born -- my life was born in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, I see, I see young -- I'm not -- I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria and Somalia, algaian collaborators with African countries.
I've worked for a nRO, and every single project, and every single project that we're going to stand up.
I was sort of course.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people and good working in Africa, and good working in Africa.
Instead, we did allowed all of what we did.
Our first project, what my first project, which is the first book "Ripples from the America," inspirer, after the sambias, as a cambiasias, like non-based.
We came with italia, we came to South America, in South Abia, which is to the sambia, which is the sambia, and we live in the same of the same talue of the animalian and twice and twice.
Of course, the answer was nothing interesting to do it, so we didn't have an interesting them for working for the work, and sometimes they also do it.
We were instantly, we were in a so early talue of animals.
But instead of wondering why they were nothing to say, "God, we just say, "God,"
"Gerade, you know, to read people to return the people of the sambias."
Of course, everything is wonderful in Africa.
We had this practices. In Italian, and in Italia, they were so big, in Sambia so big.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Shinian, like skin, like skin."
When the tomates, and red, came out about 200 nights about 200 nights and free-milpower and free.
We said, "Oh Godnnn, "Oh God,"
And they said, "Yes, we didn't have a country here."
"Why didn't you say, "I'm not going to be used to us."
I thought, well, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what I saw what the Americans doing what the English was doing what the English, which made me, what I was doing, I was sureded in our project.
We five the nilp of the nilp of the nilp.
You should see the university -- you should see the university that we don't see the United African people.
They should be the book "Dead Aida Moyo," it's a sambian economic economic economic economic economist.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have the African countries have 15 million euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has told you.
Let me just their book.
Lester you have a African, what we've done.
We're important people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are two poories, and we're just two points, and we're patriarchiatriarchianism.
Both of the lather of the latines, "Thather" which means "Vather"
But they have two different conditions.
Patriarchali: I'm a different culture, and they would be my children. "I love my children. "I love my children."

Today, the morning of the herror, the conference, a stab on the boden and asked, "Can you're a city of city, you know, that's not neocolonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react with people, and he was a system called companies, and he never been investigate something that never been initiated in the personalized, but you're going to be the distribution of the personalists.
What you do -- you do -- you do is the mouth.
You never might never memory with ideas with ideas, you're going together with the skimical simic.
We don't work from bread.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in cars.
We don't have infrastructure.
We fly found friends and find out what the person wants to find out what person wants to find.
The most important is the passion.
You can someone can be a idea of a idea.
If you don't like that person to do that?
The person for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The person for your own growth is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find that knowledge that never can be allowed to be able to be able to be able to be.
The person with the idea has not the idea of knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this one of the things that we should be in a community and people should do what they should do, why they should we hear them? But we don't hear it? But not in community.
Let me tell you a brain.
There's a problem with community.
We never have never been part of the public and they're never want to say what they want to tell their money to see what they want to see.
Planation has this blindow.
The most people who knows the community of the community, because they never do not because they never do it.
We worked to do this, we have to do this to do this, to do this social infrastructure, not existed.
A new box is going to be created.
This is the house of the companies that corporate of the bedroom of the bedroom, with you in the house, and in the caful and in the caful, you're going to find your passion to find your lives.

I promoved to the time and trying to get out of time and trying to say what we should say what to do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had the first year and he had three days, and I had three days, I'm going to help him. He was him. He was a garage, and I was him to get himself in a restaurants and I was going to get a restaurants and himself and head.
I'm half of these fishes and working with these wonderful thoughts, and I don't get a fish in Albany for 60 cents, but for Japanesearch for Sushi, but for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I'm doing something very, very, very, very difficult.
I half and I hear the mouth and high."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Maches you."
We've done it in 300 genemics.
We have 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go on the companies.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the story of the story, story of a few years ago.
Peter pressure was Philosophyprofessor, before he was businessor, Peter. Peterriner said, Peter's in reality, in fact, in fact, in fact, and the economy."
Planation is the death of the United States.
So you built covering covering the cover, and you know what the christian covering with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to achieve that.
You have to give them a privacy and privacy, and you have to help them to help them to help them to help them, and they're going to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people ago, the intelligence and the people?
For what practice is you've been able today, most of the morning?
<unk>rible, embracial human beings.
I want to say that companies to say that company is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- night fossil fossil fuels, fully -- and suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly, and there's not after.
The consumption is not afterward is not after.
The friend of the instandment is not afterward.
We need to look at how we have to look at the same way we can record people to sustainable ways to corres, transportation and with them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will be the technology for the green revolution? Ourvolution?
The government? Co you.
It's going to be able to do it. And they're going to do it.
I'm going to make a future in a future of a future of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were the edits that were to city took the future of New York New York New York New York.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happens in 100 years with the city of New York New York, and the short of New York, the city: The New York New York New York.
Why? You see the curve and said, if the curve, and they said, if the population in this tempoints, they needed to be able to stop the people to stop the people who are impossible to be able to be able to be able to be able to fight with the million power.
Because they went to the mistakes.
One of 1860s, they see the most technology that life is the life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, 1900, there was 1001, there was 1001, 1001.
The idea that I had a different technology to find a different technology. It was a little bit of little fabrics in the backland.
Davorn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a brain, to work with companies.
When he has to be able to record the discussion.
And they don't come and talk to you.
When you have to record them to give them, engaged and employees.
Then you have to tell them the absolutely truthority.
From the smallest firma, all of the largest company, three things out of the largest products: That needs to be able to be able to behavios, and its available.
Rather you?
We never have a single person who can do something that the same time, and we can produce something that can care the money and to make the money.
That's something exists not.
This person was never been done.
We have found the research and we written about 100 iconic firms of the world -- Carnegie, Westing, Edison, Fordon, Google, Google, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Goo
There's only one thing that allows allowed the world, only has been a single companies of the world, it was a person who was a person.
Now, we live in 16-year-old in Northland, and we started the United States, and we started to learning two side of Richardiography, and the first two side of the 16-year-olds. The first time,
No time, "If and 32 mal "wir."
He wasn't all alone.
Nobody's a company of all. Nobody. Nobody.
So we can tell you a community, in the middle of the middle of the brain, and you have a little bars, and you have a little bars and bars.
What can you do it? Can you make it?
Okay, can you buy it? Can you're going to get the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't." "Mo you know that I can young someone?"
We activate genemics.
We have groups of freedom that can be under the companies that can be under the companies that can help them to help them to help them. We have found that the wonderful intelligence of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economic economic economic economic economic
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be age how it must be in the wonderful.
The Pennity University is battle -- a Dozin for communication -- increasing in the communication in communication.
I had angry --
It's right angest. Angestors with their students and their great brains and their great books and their books, not understanding the books.
But as the conversation of the conversation, he was like Alice, as a nine, and it turns out to a whole new world, and a whole new world.
And I felt like, I felt like I was talking about the students of students. I was going to lead about the thought that they had to be able to decided that other words that other words.
I think that taking this door to open, it's great collective communication.
We need to need to change the communication of our scientists and in our scientists and insures to change the world.
Because our scientists and inside the problems that are the biggest problems that we have energy, energy, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't understand it. I don't think it's not going to believe that it's not believe that we're not going to believe in our con
But these great conversation is not to get our scientists and inside our scientists and in their wonderful and in their wonderful.
So scientists and ingener and ingenerate, clearly,
I want to show you a few answer, how you can see it, how you can see that we can see that science and technology and technology and technology and the technology and talking about it.
The first question that you have to be able to be able to be, and?
Sages us, why we're going to know why the scientific visible for us.
Say not only us to tract that their draws, but also says that their drawings that their draws that their draws, and they're going to under our cooks, because they can understand the most important, and they can understand and understanding.
And if you do that, what you do is, then you do, then you're doing it.
After the winds are a hands of change.
Sure could you be approaching, and it's pretty simply, but why don't you just say, "Ra and time," and time, what's a lot of us?
Our minds, in fact, it's not the same thing as their nive as their nive.
As astein is, "Mache said, "Mach things like that things like possible."
You can tell us something about your scientific scientific eye, without the compromise of it without the compromise.
A few things are going to be able to make sure: Because stories and analogies, stories, and analogies.
And if you're working on the work, then the story, then the story.
Have you ever ever ever wondered why it's "Stichpunct"?
What happens when someone is that if someone else? One of the first time, and with these points, and with these points.
A following this is not just long, but also, but also too much more and more involved part of our brains and dading our brains and thought about our brains.
These example of graview of Genevieve Brown is much we showed that the specific structure of the tracture of the trabe of the tracture of the inspiration of the inspiration of the effective design.
The terrick here is a single thing to use a sentence of the audience, if it can use the audience, if it can be audience, orientists and graphics and graphics and graphics that we're going to make our open.
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these animals and the wonderful and the science and the technology and technology and technology.
And so the insures that I've been involved me to tell me, with the <unk>Nerday," in meeting with a contaction, I want to collection with a same thing.
Actually, in fact, science is embracted and each other, and each other, so that's part of the relevance, so what's important, and multiplicated with the same thing that is important to be incredible for their work. And society. And that's incredible.
So scientists and inside the same way that you're going to be able to make me unbed me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy cancer a cell phone in Syria,
With a handy can twice a news and a protesta work in <unk>gyped in <unk>gyped.
And with a handy can take a longer, it's high-dio and books.
All that's possible.
I'm year, I'm in Berlin.
Let's go back to that time in this city.
And you can see how hundreds of people in change for change, and the streets of people who went to the streets.
We are in 1989 and we are in 1989 and we're all these people who have change and change the change, a handy in the tasks.
Who in the Saal has a handy of this?
Half you high.
Half you high-and phone, you high!
Half you high. One, a bubble, a bubble.
These are many. Fast everyone has a cell phone.
But today, and my handy was talking about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35830 cells of information.
Rohdata.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.
This riversity is called Rightliny today.
These research is that every particular telephone in Europe, everyone in Europe, every Internet, a bandard Europe, a bandard of bandards, a bander of recording.
Who is it? Who are you? Who is a email?
Who skin a sMS?
And if you're using a handy, where you're doing.
All of these information are going to be for months for two years to two years of your telephone or your telephone or your Internet, or your Internet.
And everywhere in Europe are people on Europe, and we don't want to do."
They said, we said, we want to do this idea.
We want to be sky self-digital time and we don't want to be able to do that the telephone and internet, and we need to be able to remain all these information about us.
There was anwers, Journalists, Journalists who all said, "That's not want to say, "That's not want to."
And here you can see how to see how to see people on the streets of boards and said, "Freeth."
And some of them said, this could be the state of 20.
The state was the brain was the brain in Ostruction in Ostitut.
And I asked myself, if that really works really working.
Can you really think about this information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my telephone, I asked my telecom, the greatest telephone that was the largest telephone in Department, and I asked them, and I asked told me, and I was allowed told me.
And I asked them a time and she was asked them, and they don't have a right answer. Nururer Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life issue.
So I decided to do a guy, and I wanted to make them a single thing because I wanted to have this information.
But the duter programs said, no, no, we're going to be done.
At the end of the same thing with them.
I'm going to go back to the beginning of them, they all sended me to send all the information.
Because in the currently the boundary removation of the emotion of the emotion.
So I explain this high-making environment with a CD.
And on the CD was this:
35830 ceiling information.
First, I saw it, and he said, it's half a huge date. My. My.
But then I realized a way: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I be able to do with this?
Because you see where I'm going to see where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the publicity of the publicity.
I want to make them audience.
Because I want to show you what people want to show you what the idea of what it means.
So with time, with open Data City, I've data City.
This is a visualization of sex months of my life.
You can reincooms and you can return it back and you can return back and back to the puls.
You can do every step, I can do it, I can do it.
And you can see how I can see how I can see from Frankful, and as many years, and how many antrate, and how many ants.
All that's possible to this information.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
First, it's just so, I'm just asking my wife and we remove a few mal with each other.
And then I call a few friends and they call it and they call it.
And after a while you and you're going to take this huge communication, and we have this huge communication.
But you can see how people can see people with each other communicate, they can go to bed a country, they go to Bettle.
That's all see that.
You know, you know, you know, you know, about who are the figures of the groups are the groups.
If you can see the information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have to do that information, you can control the society.
That's a bubblan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect effects of the world, how you can do a society, because you can talk to you, who know who you're going to talk to this is possible, everything that's possible, if you have to do that information.
And these information are going to be for months of months, in Europe, in Europe,
As I remember, we asked that all of these people in the streets in the streets in 1989 Handys in 1989 Handys in their tasks.
And the state of the state, who was in the demonstration of the demonstration of the state, who would have been done who are never happened to be the leaders are never happened.
The case of the baller of the blind may not stattle.
And also, not the case of the case of the ice.
Because today, and firms and companies like so many information, how many information can be survive and often, infline and often.
They want to be able to remember our lives, and they want to read all the time.
But self-bestimate and a life in your life in your life, not a wider.
But you have to have to create for the self-based for the same thing.
They have to be able to fight.
So if you go home, you're going to go home friends that privacy is a waiting of the 21st century.
If you go home, you're going to tell your attacks, because the companies and state the opportunity to species, they have to specific information, they don't do it.
And if you don't think you're not believe your telephone, you have told you about you, they've seen to the information.
So in the future, every time you're using your handy, if you're going to remember your handy, you're going to remember the same time.
Thank you.

And by the antic plants, you know, you know, 10,000 sames.
With the bohborh in the wall of a dollars in the wall and green up on the wall.
It's my homebots, I say people should be able to build their own food.
His eating food is like his own money is like his own money.
Look, I have a conversation in South Central.
I went to go there. I have my skin. I have my skin.
And I know, part of this part of this part of this imagined reality to be able to be able to be able to fabricianity.
Look, I'm a coin.
Garden work is my graffiti. I'm going to painting my art.
All right like a graffiti-known covers, the walls, I change Rasena and Parkanla.
I used to use the garden, the Earth, and the plants and the plants and the piece of my cities.
They would be able to use what the experience, if you can use it as a line.
You can't imagine how it's a sun, and how they're a sun, and how they're using people.
So what happened?
I've got to tell you how my garden for the instrument for the experience and the result of my fourth.
To the community to change the community of the box of the box.
We are the boden.
They would be wonderful, how kids are going to be conflict.
Garmers is the therapistic and coast, and you can do it, because you can do is particularly in the city.
And then you know, you know, you're writing.
I remember this mother, when this mother and their daughter and their daughter, it was came to my garden, and they were able to skin, and I came out.
I'm really smelling me, because they were like, because they were there, and I said, "Wis don't have to do that.
The garden is not without the street."
I've been wondering if I saw people who were so never been so nice, and I've been doing me, and I was like to do that, "Fin, you don't have any finished me, you don't have anything you're not going to feel you."
And I said, "Thy, no, no, I don't know what they're not approach.
And it's what it's doing.
That's what the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it, but I want to take their health."
At one of the other time, I was a garden in this observation in Downtown LA.
These are the types that I've got to decided to decided to decided.
It was cool and they were part of their stories about how it has to see how it has drawing their mother and how they've done with her mother and their grandmother, and it was greater, and it was a moment.
Green reason about 20 generated about 20 generated 20 generated.
To our Umgrab-Action came up so 50 people and doing all freedom and all freedom.
If you children, if kids, it's children.
When they tomates, they food domata.
But if they don't get to get it, if they don't get the food, as it's not going to be able to remember whatever you're going to be able to do it.
I see some young people who want to work, but they want to work in this thing -- I see, I see, I see the same children who are exactly the same thing that they are going to go for them, and they're going to go out.
The garden, I see that as a presentize where we can train them to care their community to care their community to care to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to five life.
And if we do that, who know who know who know who?
We could take the next George Washington Carverton Carvernment.
But if we don't change the collection of the experience, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my planet. That's what I want to do.
I want to be a whole wirelocking power, where people can be part of the same bubblocks.
I want to take school and I want to take them in health caf."
So, don't understand me.
I don't talk about costless, because it's not sustainable.
The comicating is that you have to be ability to behavior.
I'm talking about people to work with people, and children of the streets of the streets, and they recording the streets and the early, and if you're going to make your own food, and if you buildings.
So what I want to do is here to do is this is the sixy.
I want to believe that we all opportunity, Ganger, Ganger, Ganger.
We need to represent the image of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger, you don't have a ganger.
Ganger will you get to the sky, you know, right?
And let's the waffected to be the choice.
If you want to make meeting meeting me, you don't want to make meeting in a sequence and a meting and a meting where you want to talk about it.
If you want to make meet meet you want to get your shock, and you can do anything that we can make some site powerful power.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite sounds in the entire oxford English World English Willergoster.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No," is increase."
Once the 19th century, a time, a better definition of a better definition: "Ein Snollygoster is someone who is someone who is someone who is someone who is astonism or line, program or line, or approaching.
I don't have a similar, "spracheral" is.
I think that's what I think I think.
But it's very important that words in the centrum of the politicians, and all politicians that they need to control.
At 171, for example, for example, the British Parlament, not the exactly the design of the design of the design of the design.
And that was actually going back to the mother of a management with the management of a manager of Brass Crosby, who was with the Parlament.
She was him in the Tower of London and later, but he was a muth, he was mutut enough enough to reach enough to smart enough, and he was so much university in London, he was so much important.
And only one of years later, we find the first neighborhood for the first time, "so strong as Brass". Viele.
Brazy is the English word for Blech.
But that's not going to go back to a piece of practice.
But to show you how we're going to show you how we're going to take you with you, I want to take you in U.S., as they're going to take the United States,
You see, you look at the question of what you should call the state of the state of the state of the factor.
You know it didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a republic nation?
And that was in the Congress in the Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible for possible.
I mean, some people wanted to call him, and other people, and other things, and other side, and other skills, and others, and others, and others of the United States of America, whathington.
Not even a present.
Some people want to call him.
They thought that's while.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to be a best time for a best time.
It would have been working.
But everyone was unbelievable, because these distributed 3 weeks,
I have the days of a sators, the sators who are strong, "Immerica."
The reason for the longer and the long time, and the long time was that the representation was the satence.
The representation was not going to be that what was going to do is going to do. They don't want to do it.
Can you call them, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to make it.
They wanted to give them the most farmers, the most farmers, the most farmers who had a game.
This title was "President"
President. They don't existed the title. He didn't exist. But he was a single thing. But someone who was a vamm of a vamma.
So something like this is a jury.
He had no large reason as the reason, "Ano" or "An't have the called "An't have the called "An't have anymore.
Sometimes, there were little colonial community and regular community and governments, but it was a unbediating title title.
That's why he could be able to sat him.
They said, "That's longer, you can't call him.
This is a classrooms, and they have to make surprising and creating citizens.
Who will take him, if he take a dummines, if he's going to take a thumbsident of America?"
And also after three weeks, the senatence of the senat.
Instead of the same thing that you want to be able to record the title of the opportunity, but they wanted to make it.
You can learn from three interesting things.
First, and I think that, I've been able to figure out if I didn't have anything that the senates, even the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just just just sentence. He was just going to be just about it.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government is that something temporary -- then you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to be 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important thing that is the most important point, is that the title of the United States of America" of America" is not so much more than that?
That's something more than 5,000 nuclear popular popular popular biggest volcolars and a flection of the world and a fleoth and a flyingle.
And we've been doing the title of the title of the title.
And so that's what the end of the end of the end.
They have a respectables of title.
And the other sensors of the sense of the sense of empathy -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound how the cerling with the 5,000 nuclear language.
So the end of the senat and the representation and the representation, because no one is never felt that if you're going to feel that you're going to be the president of America.
And that's important, what you can take with the most important, and I'm going to make me.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality to control the reality, but actually changes the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality.
Thank you.
So I came in a laster with about 50 rebeing campaigns to the valabad of Dalabad, full-year-old, full-year-old, Florida.
I thousands of my bad college Halbrary country, and I needed a pairs and fire in Rights in Rights, and I couldn't see a rocket.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was involved with the war, all of the warming new pyjama-Partys and footballs and footprints and footprint with risk and religional south of the DNA and religionalists.
But that's the opposite of self-digh.
And so I'm going to be here, I'm going to work, Southe, Southe-Proletes Godes, and atheist and atheist and atheist and a radical citizens, and a high-foresting next years, and after the last year.
So there's a lot of good things that we could do is a lot of things that you could do, but I couldn't make a personality, but I want to make cars, I want to make cars and make the personality and cars and carrying and carrying and representation.
I want to spend a day in life of a diction -- Ganghad -- the Dihad, the vihads like <unk>Pope, like <unk>Popar Bling Bling Blings and public siously, and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's what the distriction can do is to make the Parlament to candidate and a choice and a choice with the Slogan: "What's what I'm going to do."
And trying to use these campaigns to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosiosity as nationalhels.
I want to take a corruption in Afghanistan, and I'm going to go to the project, "Rucky" instead of the policists, and you're going to take a wrong control the cars and cars.
I want to look at me, like the conflict in Afghanistan, I want to be after the "modic conflict."
The warning and the writing and the free of the free, and the models that we have a new environment for style and motion that you can only a model of a model of sky, and you can do a model of self-delships, and I collectioned a collection of models.
And I would like to see how a simple simple chubkarre from Cabular cabulating Appelled application of 189999, to create a development of the world's creative developments of their own color.
But for all these things can be in prison, you can get together, they can be able to be able to get finter.
But I'm doing because I have to do because the opposite of self-like.
That's my favorite. Which is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My Name is Cameron Russell and since I was working as a model.
Second 10 years, just like this.
I have the feeling that now is now in the room is a unfortunately language, because I wouldn't have this cleides.
I've been able to do something for a way to do something for the way.
This is the first time, this is the first time you can see someone on TED books, so you can see that you can see, so I think you can see.
If you really women really explored women were really switching me to tell me that now I don't want to twitter.
I also think that I'm really privileged that I can change the very course, because I can change 10 seconds, what you think about me.
There's not everyone has anyone.
These are very unfortunately unfortunately, it's good, I didn't want to wanted to wanted to do it.
The most difficult part of my most part of my head, because the pullovered me to cover all of my head, you're allowed me to do that, so long as long as long as a long time.
In order.
Why did I do this now?
That was a possible.
Well, it wasn't so picture as this picture.
At the smile, but a image is also operating.
I've just changed your memory of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never really never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photographed me, I was solve my hands and I was solve this types in the hands.
And by the operations or the wrong or the wrong breaks that I was two days ago, there are two days, there are very impossibilities, and our oilities, and our oilities, and our oility has been aware of our lives -- and it's opportunity -- and it's operately impactive.
For explaining to be hot today today.
And I'm standing on this book because I'm a model.
I'm going to standing because I'm a high, because I'm a woman who called the branch of my branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always standing, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh," but that means that means nothing.
The years of the reason I was a model, is a violence in the genetic lottery and maybe you're going to ask you, and maybe this experience.
Well, in the last few century, we don't just as health and young and someone and young and symmetrically programs are programmed, but also a biological programs, but also hospital, and hospitalf.
This is a same thing for me. And it's a superience that's a same thing.
I know there are people in the audience that points are skeptical. And maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Nai, Tray. Nai, Tray. Well, Joan Small.
And I'm going to comment your model-where. S teacher.
But I have to tell you that I had to tell you that in 2007, a very at the year of NYU.D.
The next question that I'm always been going to believe me, "Cann I'm going to be a model?"
And I'm going to start, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to be really girls, "Why?
Do you know what? You can be all be.
You can see Presidentin of the U.S. or the U.S. or the next Internet or a ninja-Hermina-Dricher, which is what's going to be irregness."
If you're still telling this greater, no, no, no, no, Cameron, I want to say, "Well," I want to say, "Who."
Because I don't have a responsibility and you couldn't be the carrin of American vogue or the business or the next same sense of Hamp; or the next survey.
Tell, you know that you're going to be a model, you want to say that sometimes you want to say that you want to be a pottoto the lottototo the lottototo the lotto.
You can't immediately, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years, I'm going to tell you how to do that, because other than history can be just as a heart.
If there's a photograph, and that's exactly what a nice, and you say, "Camer, and the courage, and you want to go to the camera," and then you're going to go to the poor, and then you go to this poor, and that's going to be after that.
It looks like this.
Hopefully more comic than the middle.
That was ... I don't know what happened.
If you're going to be a lives and a few Jobs, and you can't do a lot more saying, if you don't want to say that you're going to say that you want to be a lot of the United States, but you want to go, "Mod," you're going to go to the money.
The next question that I said, "What's going to be all photoss?"
And yes, so quite all photos will be returned, but that's just a little part of the stories.
That's all the most photo, and that I didn't do that, and that was also the most time I had a biciniode. I hadn't even even even my piode.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I looked for a few months from my grandmother.
That's what I'm at the day.
My friends had to start with me.
That's what I'm on a py, a few day, a few day, a pyoting for the early for the early.
That's what I'm going to do with the footh and in the v-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
It's constructure and it's construction of profession of profis, from Haune, and Make-up-clists and photographs and photographs and all their eyes and the production and the production and the production.
Okay, as a next thing that people say, "Wever you're always writing?"
Yes, I have too many 20-cm-crets, I never met, but I could never met, but the things that I'm going to believe things that I'm going to learning things that I'm going to learning about life.
I'm in Cambridge and one day, and one day I went to a cambridge and I had my grading me to do this.
When teenager, I went to my friend with my friends with a food food, and they were a red launch and of course, we needed to get a red, and of course, "I needed," and we could do," and we could do more and we could far.
I have this costs of my extract things and not getting my personality and not because of my personality and there are people who are nothing to understand their personality and nothing a high-diority.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and I filmed, 85 percent of the latinos and latinos and latinos and most of young men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men's not the question and Latinos, "What's not the question?"
And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the wanted to go to the wall?"
And I found my research for these talks of my research that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the U.S. And these numbers, and these numbers.
The last question of me, "How is it, how is it?"
And I think they're going to believe this answer: "Well you a little bit of young memory and believe you're going to feel very happy and felt very happy and finally, and finally, and fably.
And Backage, we're going to give you a answer that might be able to make this evention.
We say, "It's really good to talk to receive, and it's greative, and it's greative people inspiring."
All that's true, but it's just a half of the story that we never say, "I never know what I never say, "I've never said, "I've never said, "I feels."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think about my exactly.
And if you ask you, you know, "What do I think, if I think if I had you'd believe you?"
And then you should make a few models, because they've got the thins, because they've got the most during the most cool cool, and they're the cool cool, and they're going to understand the women's most important women.
When I was a lot of this talking about this visit, it's very difficult to create a real piece of approaching me, because I felt very uncomfortable, and I'm very uncomfortable, and I'm going to tell you all of my first piece." And I was going to feel.
It was very difficult, it was very difficult to be a very difference and risk and rashion often, if I'm a greater of the greatest nutrition of it.
But I'm also happy and felt like, and I'm going to tell you that I'd like to finish that I've been here, and I've been here, before 10 or 30 or 30 or 30 or 30 years, and I wouldn't have a little bit more than my career, I wouldn't have a good job.
If you look out of this talking about this vision, then we all the power of the imagination of the illness and following the power and follower.
Thank you.
I've never been the words of my grandmother never been in the experience is, "Son, list of the Exili Widafi Widafi Widafi Widafi Widdafi Widafi Widafi.
But who never never been to do something like a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years old, since the liby screening of revolution is inspired by the waves of the waves of the waves of the massrooms in the older than also in the optical revolution.
I spent took a lot of other libyers, and I was absolutely behavior, to corn and a day of the corn and to start a revolution and to start a revolution of Gadaffire Gadaffire Gadaff.
And there was a great revolution.
June, liby women and men and men in the first rior, the first range of the range of the range of the rule of the rules, and social generality, and social general community.
They have a practice mutes, by carrying by using the brutal Diatur Gaddafism.
They have a strong sense of sense of the most farmers, from the most farmers, until the west.
And finally, after a time of six months, and five crosss and five to the country, and we're going to start our country and the tyranians.
But Gaddafi, every big big big big big big big big bio, the corruption and the corruption and the reason for course.
And over four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannic Regime, the infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the lybic structure of the lybian society.
The consumption and the challenge and the challenge, I used to do how many other women who are so many other women who are recording society and we're going to build approaching and we're going to take away and never been able to take away.
And so, in 200 organizations were during and unmidently in Benghafis in Benghazi, found 300 in Benghaziolis.
After 33 years in Exil, I came back to Lybia, and with a single Enthiasmusiasmusiasmus, I started to the themen, human education, human education and fundamental education.
With a wonderful group of women, I was the free women, I was a movement libying women, a movement of women, free of women, and it's public heading for the curopulation of our public public public public public publ
And I met the number of a very difficult environment, a very difficult environment, and it's always strong, and a couple of the egoistic politics of Dominan and expression of Dominan and expression.
I live a interesting of the Freezery, and I was a women, and women, to make a lible forging a law, a facilities, and every brought to be able to be able to be able to tell you that should be affording and choice.
At the end of our initiative, and he was successful.
Women women women, 175 percent of the National Walking for 52 years.
But long, but the longer eye of the euphory of the weeks and the whole research, we thought we were waughters.
And one morning, we thought about changing the money and suffering and Sufi Gralter Mozer.
And we've got to go to the morning of the Mordin American bottom and the angrian bottom.
And again, again, the experience of officients of officients.
And every day, we're really expecting the herriculture of the milize and their others and their opportunities and their mission of regulationships and laws.
Our society, information of a revolutionary, polarized, polarized and discovered by the ideal and principles, social generality, social general community, social genderships.
Intolerances, explained and rightened to the icones of the economists.
I'm not going to tell you about it with the successful with the successful, and I'm nothing our reluss and the choice.
And I'm a lot of here today, that we've been as a nation that we've been wrong and the wrong decisions.
We've got our priorities.
Because the choice of writing free stability or surface in Lybia.
Hat the reason of the rivers and the ways and the ways of the ways and men and men and men and national wars and national virtual virtual visional vision?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why will our society is going to be able to politics and dominated by self-shinances and the exclusion of mence, and the exclusion of men?
Maybe the women didn't have the only thing that has been the women whole women whole women's the women and the one of the sound.
Our society has a national dialogue and consumption, and conditions as they've done the choice, the end of the end of the end of the end of two and decision.
Our society has to have the qualitative constantial literally more than they need to be more than they need to be the number of the way of the way.
We need to stop the name of the corning and a day of the running and a day.
We need to be able to do with the name of the middle of the brain.
We need to develop a white discovery the following woods that wouldn't just too, but also too, but also to do it, collaboratting roaching together, instead of course, a constatting curious,
These are the ideal that ideal war, the ideal warription of warbia Lybiabia, to get free peace.
Because the war has a alchemy and in this alchemy is about the chemistry and masculines and masculines and masculines.
That's the real reverse is the real.
And we need to existence the exists, we have to do it sociopolitical.
After a vision of the Koran "Salam" -- Freeree" -- Freez God's the word "The God."

And just like the mother's the embryo, the embry, completely to the size of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middlexistence.
That's why we said, "My Gnade all things."
That's why we said, "My Gnade has been recently my grand."
So the biggest of all the genera of the grandmade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country, and I went to best the best of the long "Nothing"
And I was very strong.
In school, we created the story of Cim Il-Ship, but we don't learned to learn about the world, America, South America, South America, and Japanese are our farmers.
Although I was asked to ask me, as the eye, I thought, I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until the northern America.
With they saw years, I saw a public head, but I thought, but I thought my life in North Korea, I thought my life.
My family was not poor, and I had to be approach.
But in 1995, my mother was a broad of a broad of a college.
Darin stood: "When you're going to be our five five five families, because we don't have two weeks, because we didn't have two weeks.
We love together and our bodies are so hard and our body is so harder."
I was so highly.
I heard to hear the first time, I heard that people in my country.
I went took on the bahnof, and I saw something that I can't look at the box, I can't learn from my experience.
A woman los woman, and a path, and a couple of children in their army in their army in the face of his mother.
But no one was half of them because all of them because all so that they were sold to care and their families and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hander in North Korea.
At the end of the end of North Koreaner's prediction of the heart of the open, and many more and many more and many more and many more and basically, and basically, and basically outside.
As after all, and more and more half after the way to get me to the covered me to the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the U.S.
I was always wondering why they had there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite of North Korea and his neighborhood.
That's the flow of the Fluss Amrocore, the North Korea and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China.
How you can see the flower of the flowerful and he's very impossible North Korean,
But many sters.
Sometimes I saw people in the flow.
I can't think about how I can tell you how North Korea, but I can tell you that I can tell you that I could removed in China, and I was decided to china.
I thought that I thought that I would be a course of my family.
I would never thought that it was 14 years together, together together.
In China was very hard to live as young girls without family.
I had no idea of how life was the life as a northernocorean flying. But I would be extremely, but I wouldn't just extremely hard, but also very hard, but also very dangerous, but also the northernal fish in China.
So I lived in strong standing that my reality of identity, and you would be in a huge, and you would send me to North Korea,
One day, my greatest alptraum was probably as I was biggesting, and in the Chinese police and in the police of the police.
Someone to be a north Koreanerina, so they did my chinese chinese chinese chinese and I tell me my chines.
I had solided to do that, I thought my heart.
Would be somewhator, I could be explained, I could be empower and able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to doing.
I thought that was the end of my life, but I was going to control, but I felt my feelings and I felt the questions.
After they were asking them with the example, he said, "That was a false, "That was a false.
It's not North Korean."
And they love me. It was a wonderful.
Some North Koreanerana in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had great great great happiness.
Even though they were taken, they were flying, they were free international pressure international pressure.
This northern Koreanins didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, in China, in China, and after the North Korea, and after North Korea, where they're going to be able to be history or opened or opened.
Although I had told my flying, I had a lot of other northern Korean, not so much other northernorean.
It's tragic that North Koreaner's cored to survival and hard to survival.
And then they've learned a new language and worked on the world, can be in a moment on the world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the most decided to go to South Korea, and I've been starting to go back to Southerno.
Mich in South Korea never, a greater challenge, a greater challenge, when I thought it was.
English was in South Korea so important, I had to learning my third language.
Audience I have the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all corean, but we've been very excited by 67 years, we're very excited by 67 years of the part of the part of the part of the part of the core.
If I was able to remember a identity.
Bin Is South or North Korean?
Where do I come from? Who I am I?
Auddenly, there was no lander, it would have been a country.
Although I had the anpassion of the southern Corean life, I had a plan.
I'm going to be able to representation of the university.
And I was thinking about my new life, I could have been able to get a bad.
The northern Korean Beholds, the money, and when I was my family, and when I was my family between my family between the place.
They had to fast as possible as possible to plan their flying.
North Koreaneran streets to get back to the freedom.
It's almost impossible between North and South Korea and South Aronically, Ironically, I was going to take a piece of China and made me to the way to the northern Corean Grenchanic Grench.
Because my family was not a chinese language, I had to live in more than 2,000 miles and then after South Adostasia.
The business is a week, and we've been remained more fast,
As a time when the bus once, came, came out of a chinese police,
He took the extraction of all, and he started questions.
And I didn't understand my family, I thought it would be family.
When the Chinese moviewed my family, I decided to be able to do it, and she said that they would be able to do it, and I was six.
He looked at me, but he was involved, but happy.
We've got to read it to the launch, but I had to fast all my money to recontrols to the grands of Laosaos.
But even though we had the grandmaries, my family inhaft, my family inhaft, illegal Grench.
After I had gone money and shocked my family, my family inside a months inside a months, but it was family in the main of Losaft, and in the mainsta.
That was one of the greatest ruid of my life.
I had all done to family to family to free head, and we were so nearly family, but my family was family, only family, only the southerness.
I went back and I went through the awander of the police and the police and trying to family, my family, but I hadn't enough to reach the money, but I hadn't enough to paying up again.
I'm lost all my hope.
And I asked the voice of a man who is losing?"
I was fully about it, that a friends is a free.
In broken English and with a wilding and heard my situation and I went to create my situation and without a bank of the money, and they were two more family and two more northern Corean, and they get two more family.
I thank you very much about him, and I asked him, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he was.
"I help the northern Corean people."
Mird was a symbolic moment in my life.
The revorite free-down free-mbolized for me to a new hope for me to a new hope, and he needed me to show me the Northern Coreancore and the friends and the university of the community of the community as a northernational community as the north.
And finally, after our long risk, my family and I remember family, but the freedom, but the freedom.
Many North Koreaneran, and they're going to be able to get them in a new country, and they're not going to get them in a new land.
The international community can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us and many more.
We can also be the bridge between people in North Korea and the Aucorea and many of us in contact with families, and we're going to stop them information and we're going to change the information and countries, and we change the northernal.
I had a lucky, so much hope and inspiration inspiration in my life, I hope that I hope to successful northernational compared with international companies.
I'm sure you're going to see much more successful North Koreaner on the world, also seeing on the world, but also on the book.
Thank you.
I just have a bit of a bit.
I don't tell me that I'm not normal.
I want to tell you my break.
Remi is 22, big and very well-free,
He can't talk to you, but he can't communicated free of the best red of the best red of the best red.
Remian know what Lieve is.
He's particularly expensive and expensive it.
He's not just a real time. He doesn't go on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious difference and imagine you're just never seems like this.
When he was a lower of our childhood, I'm going to try to remember the still, I remember one thing: how we know about how to know how to know how it's going to know how it must be a wonderful unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He's a absolutely unfortable brain.
But he's also a six.
He can't remember my shocola, and he's remember, but he remember the public publication of every course, and he was involved in my iPod, and he was fourth, when he was fourth of all the most policies of my arm.
Don't it sure?
But many people don't have a lot of people.
And in fact, because their constructional prediction of normal past, they're going to be old, they're going to be false.
But what my heart is the heart and my sea, and my sea, whether this was the case of the case wasn't even though they were not similar to see that it could be appropriate, they could be awared -- they were extraordinary -- extraordinary.
Well, for thejects of you who don't understand the process of you, it's a complex function of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain, and you know, the social communication, and sometimes the skills.
It's approaching each individual, is why is the space of the room is sam.
And the world is all 20 minutes are all 20 minutes, and whether it's autism and whether it's one of the most important developments of the world, there's no one of the world, there's no health or health or health or health.
And I can't remember the first time I remember, but I can't remember, but I can't remember it.
I was just three years old, when my brother, and I was so on my brother, and I was so once I was so on my life.
And after a few months, he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play how it's actually not very interested in fact, and actually not very interested in me.
Remian and regulated in his own world, with his own world, and he founds, and he founds, and he founds like the little ding things like the little bit of autos in a room, and what it's going to do with it.
And when he was sounded, he was differently different and the difference, and the difference.
But the woods and the wood and the frustrating and the frustrial haypera was something really a very unique, a religious nature, a junny, a junny, a junky, who had never been a human beings, who never had never been a human.
At the same thing.
Well, I can't live that there was some of the only family moments in my family, moments, I wished to me that they were like I would be exactly what I would be like I would be exactly what I would be.
But I'm going to go back to the thought that they've gone me to the things that they've been talking about individuality, and Individuality, and I don't want to be able to do is not asked.
Normality about the beauty of beauty that the difference that we are involved that we are differently not different, that we're not another thing that is not that one of us.
It means that there's a different kind of responsibility.
And if I could say one thing to say, and I could say to you, and then you couldn't have to be never be normal.
You know, you know, you know, you know.
Because, autistic or not, the difference that we have -- we have a story! Jedermany! Jeder's in everything eliminality, and in all the way to normality is the ultimative open.
The chance on the size, finish and walls in the moment, in the moment, in the moment, like someone else.
Bited -- you don't say that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Doco Edgrounded us with edited us with this photo on the photo on the project of a project, and with a project of only a million seconds of only second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, and you see the world, and you don't see the world, but a million or a million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion or a million or a million or a million or a m
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography, the photography, a new education, a new education that they can make time it so fastics that they can make time in the light.
And so we can build cameras, we can build the absolutely to look at the sight or without a room or without a room, and we can look at our body and really question, and really, what we can do with "Camera."
If I'm going to take a laser, and I call him in a million seconds, and it's more female -- that's more female -- it's a pethoton, and I'm going to make a billion potential, and this is going to be a monkey, and this is going to be a projective projective projective
So if you take this project, this photones, this photones and it in these flashes are going to be in these photones in the flashes?
How does it look like this light?
So, this whole events --
So think about that, you think that all the eventually, the whole eventually, less than a nanosecond -- so light, and so light to return this street, but I'm going to see this video to see this video of the factor of the factor of the light.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, in this film happens very, so let me show you what happened me to show you what happened.
The puls, our project, our project, in the flashion with a photonpaket, and it starts to move and the same thing, and the finally inside.
A part of the light of the light, and you see this table and you see this experience of the waves.
Many of the photones of the past last last past, the rivers of the flashes and exploding in different responsibility.
How you can see, is there's air, and you can see in the flashes that are in the flash.
While the waves are the waves on the waves and the waves of the reflexion of the reflexion of the rivers of the focus on the end of the flashion of the focuss.
If you take a south of project, and it's the same street, and it's the same streets and return the video, you know how long you have to see how long you have to see how long you have to see the film?
As a day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long moview -- from a long film -- from a long project.
And how does it look like this stillle-Fotography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the wall.
It's like if you're a sense of a teaching.
And it's like this, as if the nature of nature, the nature, some photo mal, but of course, of course, but of course, of course, and of course.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you're going to see that if the lights that if the lights, you're going to get this further. They're not going to be dots.
Why is that? Because the tomate is the tomate, and that's going to spring a few seconds and after seconds.
So in future, if this future, if this female camera in your camera, it might be able to be able to make it in a soupermarket, and you can see if you can see if you can see if you can build a risk.
So how did my teamera, I went to the MIT this camera?
So when you know, if you know, if you know a photograph of course, you have very important light, but we've got very important light, but we're going to get a billion times as your billion doorness, so you get a good light.
So we do, we do this: We're going to do this project that photones, and we're going to show this packet, and we're going to record and removerynronization and recording to record these data to create these fishes, and I've been recording to tell you to tell you the fire
And we can take all these rohots and we can do all these responsible things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can make us, but how would we do it with a new soul of a new soul of south, to see the souls: to see eckness?
The idea is that we're going to street up the door.
It's going to go back to the room, a part of it, part of it will go back to the door, and we could reflect the camera and we could return these more embrace and we could use these more eye.
And that's not science fiction. We've been built.
Link our female camera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to take the light.
After our embandlation in the "Nature Communication," it was published by nature, it was from nature, and they have these animation and they have these animation.
We're going to get this light and they're going to be able to reeflect this wall and this photones, and we're going to be able to be able to represent the pupped to the puppeared to the light, and then the course of the light and then ready.
And because we have a camera, the so fast -- our female -- our female camera has some single ability.
It's a very good time, and she can look at the world in Light, and they can look at the world.
And we know, of course, we know, but also the decision of course, but we don't know what we don't know what we don't know what we don't know.
Indeed a laser online, we can see a robot, we can see a robot, how they can see it -- how they're not really doing a lot of these images, but if we're going to make a lot of these images, and they're trying together and try together and try together and try together and make them together
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit of doing that we can see the visual laboratory, we can build the cars, we can build the collisions that can be able to think about what we can do is, or we can see what we can do with that, or we can see in the course of the course of the collects.
But because of the blood and building is the natural, of course, the natural, which is really a way to think about scientists, now is now about female, now, now, a new female female of the next picture of the most experience of the most amount of the next generation of memory.
So, as we can do this, and we can't have a scientists, is a scientists that we can't have a certainly a certain picture of the ultraphy, and I wasn't just clearly the data that we don't know that all of the way we don't know.
But it's happening here.
If you look at these waves, if you look at these wave you see that the waves of us.
The waves should be able to move.
What happens?
It turns out that we're going to figure out that we've been able to take this effects, and astein, and astein, and a picture of this image.
The relationships, in the events in the world, he's going to happen in the camera in the camera in the camera, so by relationships and time you can relationship and time we can create these consumeration.
So if we should be able to show you that we should be able to make a new experience, and we should have a new driveness of a new driveness of our experience, we all have data, and we all have data, and we all of our ways.
It's about the time. Thank you.
There are many ways of our opportunities, how our lives can improve our lives.
We don't make any news on the street, so many ways, so many ways, so many ways, we don't use this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighborhood and circle, and circle, snows and circle,
The projects of my wife from my wife, how much might be able to my neighbor?
How can we listen to stop more things without us?
How can we use our experiences of the country and the country and the country?
And how can we do our hope for the hope of our houses, so that our community and our citizens and trees and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea sea is going to be the huge embrahigh-dior years, the hundred years, beds and trees later, and I'm going to talk about a city, and I'm always language.
I think every time, every time, every time you never ever never know, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of most piece of the city.
If I'm going to be able to do this house and I thought it's beautiful. Dave you, I thought, I thought that my life has changed my life.
In 2009, I was someone who I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death. You know, and it was suddenly and unexpected.
I've been thinking about the death, and I was a big disease for my life, and it was really good for my life, and it's important.
But it's hard to me, these sort of sort of each days.
It's easy to lose and relate what really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I found a side of the house of the house of the house of the house of the lucky and I want to sentence, "Bevator, I want to take a bit of the both of the same thing."
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could expect the next day, but I was the next day, and she was completely completely further.
I want to share some sentence with you, the people who were written by people who were written.
"Bevor I want to suggest piratricy, I want to be away."
"Bevorite I want to suggest, I want to start with the International Datums."
"Bevor I want to single for millions of people."
"Bevor I want to serve a bubble power."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "nethen."
"Bevor I want to suggest them in my poor."
"Bevor I want to serve someone who want to be someone."
"Bevor I want to suggest, I want to be myself."
This is after place, and it was a sense of place, and the hope and the hope and trees of people needed me to make meching me to the wine and trying to the window me.
It's about it is that you don't know that you're not all.
It's about our neighborhood and understanding and second and on a new way and way.
It's about painting place for best and remembers and remember what we're important to remember what we're important, and we thought us.
I did this last year, and I did this last year, and I didn't have a hundreds of people who wanted to build a waller and I wanted to build my colleagues and I have a bask and now, and now, and now, and now, and now, and now, and I think, infrica.
We've done how much powerful public places, if we have the opportunity to explore our voice and more with other things.
Two of the most things that we have time, and the time we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than young people who are in the right bubble and thinking about the right bubble and think that life is current and empathy and empathy.
We're going to talk about it, we're going to talk about the death or just to think about it, but I've got to think that the idea that the idea of the death is the idea of the death is the most strength.
The thought of the death of the death of the death.
Our collective places in the best places that we can do what ourselves as individuals and more important to help us to share our hope and more importants and stories can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to be able to treat mathematics. A particular problem for everyone who are considered with another mathematics, is that we're going to companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you about today, I'm going to tell you what I do.
Tances is one of the most human activities.
We're developed by most of most piece of most ballettle ballettle and switches, like you'll see how you see.
For Ballettledge is a extraordinary big massive massive and ability to create a basic evidence, and possible eventually, and it could have a genetic common components.
Tractually, first of course, neurological strengthon longer slowly these extraordinary, and that makes them to be a ball of Jan Stripling Jan Stripling, who was a ballettupe.
And you've been doing a lot of research in the mistakes.
Trots, there's a worldwide 63 million people who are living in this crankity, and they have to live with the unexpected symptoms, and more living to live, and more living to be able to representate the disease of the disease of the disease.
We need to know if we have to know if you can use the only way, and last few message is the only way to know if we can know if we have a projective market, if we have a projective markets.
<unk>rigger is that there's a parkinson and other movement, so you can't simple biombs, so you can't simple biombs. That's what it's 20 minutes.
You have to be able to read it in the clinics. It's very expensive, and that means that's not going to be sustainable. Nobody's never thought.
But what if patients could do if patients could make these animals?
That would be a big decided in Krankshouse. What would be able to do that if patients could make these animals?
It wouldn't be a teacher cranks.
It costs 300 percent of 300 percent of the neurological approaching.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods, with the methods that we're trying to reach the senses, because we're all in a virtual, virtual, virtual journey.
Here you see a video of video of video.
That's happened in the health country if someone who can receive us as a stimular ballettle, because we can see all these stimular ballets, because we have to build all these stimulate, and we have to build the citizens.
And as Ballets it's enormously enormous.
Think about how long a child, like long a child, until it.
And we can use the position of the vibrate stimmlipping stimulate stimming. And as the morganisms of Parkinson.
And the way of thinking of the example of example, you can see a movement for inequipping voice.
We see this same symptoms.
Stimes, swaps, swaps.
The language is solarly such age and goes and it's a example of this.
These expects of the voice, you can see the voice, but sometimes, sometimes, but with young microphones and prime, combined with new future, combined with new line, combined with new line, we can do is very much more involved with new line.
How can we make these tests with clean mes? Well, they're not both, they're not invasive neurologists.
You know, the infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly exactly the voice of experts are not from experts.
So you can be certainly change.
They're very quickly, thought, thought,
They're very billiant and we know what that means.
If you can do something extremely, you can also make it in great massive.
And this is what we can do is we can do with this.
We can reduce logistic swimilaries for patients.
Patients don't have to leaders in the clinics in the clinics.
We can make if we can do it through the data, we can do it.
We can use the only massrooms for cruting for clean studies and experience, and it's a difference of the whole population of the realization of realizing.
We have the opportunity to create the biomarkers for the disease of the disease.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we started the Parkinson's simming.
With Aculabulab and patients, we want to take a very high number of stimular number of stimulate enough to create enough to create enough to reach the experience.
We have rooms that divided to a billion people on this planet of a billion people on this planet.
Everyone without Parkinson, or without Parkinson, took a few center for a few century. I'll get to firectlying with fire, and I've been able to do is just a hours of our century.
Thank you.
If you say, if you say 10,000 people, you can tell you can tell you who say, who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all these process?
What happens is that the patients was the present of the ancient of person on Parkinsonidsonid or not. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Some people will not be able to make it.
But we sammall data, in different data, different data, which is interesting, which is important. These are important. These are important to function that we are investing to funny, which are the most important for parks.
First of their own piece of their own piece?
It's much better.
My southern Thanasis -- I have to love him because he's so fantastic working -- now it's also working on the mobile photographic works, which is what we're going to work, and we are incredible, and we're incredible.
That's what I call a conservation.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handyres and people can do with Parkinsonn't do with Parkinsonn't take their voice, so that you can take their arrivity of the crank of the crank you.
Guess.
Thank you. Max L L L L L L L L L L L Life!
Thank you.
Here I live in Kenya, I live in Kenyairobi-National parks.
In the hundreds of my vather, you see the cover, and that's the coast of the Nairobi-National Park.
The Nairobi-National Park is just in the south is just as a south. That means that Wildrenchings like cebrases the parkets of the park.
The ruletians that lions, the solutions, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They kill our vieties.
That's one of our covered, the morning. I went took it. I was wonderful. It was a big box. It was our bully.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we think we're going together with our tests and the way of the sky. That's why we're using our animals.
I learned to do solve lions.
Our certain warming Morans. They're going to be used our collection and our hands. They're eight, and they're going to be able to read this problem.
and kill the solutions.
Here's one of six lions that were in Nairobiobiotiobi.
And I think there's a nationalobi-bi-obi-si-dig solutions.
In my stamm is a junny between six years, and next years, and next to the cowerful for the cower.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire fire. Lions for fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to help us to see the cower.
But I didn't do it. I didn't do.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to try to try to do it with a vograph.
I wanted to think that the solution I thought I was studying the cow.
But lions are very clearly clearly terrifice.
They come to see the virtual, and they go back to the next time, but they come and say, and they're not going to move, and they're still not, yeah, yeah.
And they're going to go and deeps our vieties.
One night, I was considered to the stall. I love took him and this time to get himself and this time, and that's not at the solution.
Like for the light, the light, that's moving.
I had a idea.
I was a little junch of working on my collaborator in my cover and never took the new room, and I took my mother roadio of my mother. Anyway, but I had a lot of electronics.
I took a old cars and autobatter and a motorrad. The motorrad. The left or link, whether you want to be able to blind.
And I was a shadower to a shalter, and I was a box and out of the light.
This is a little birne of a capture of a capture.
And then I built all of them.
The solar panels later, the battery who love the battery strom of the romant. I call it a transformator.
And the research less blind.
You see that the birth of the brain, because of the solutions of the solution.
And so it looks like this, if they come up.
The light blink and the lights and the solution I think I'm going to go to the stall.
Thank you.
I have this installed this installed and since we had no problems with solutions with solutions.
And then our neighborhood.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of her animals and she asked me if I asked her lights installing my favorite.
And I said, "Yeah."
If I was able to see the lights. They can see the solution in the background.
And I've been able to side them in the neighborhood with the lights and they really good.
My idea is going to be now in the whole cense, also for other robots or Leoparden or Leoparden or Leoparden. The lights, and the elephants of farms.
My experience to a stip with a stip of a stip with a stip of schools in Kenya, Brookhouse international school, and I'm really excited.
My new schools and high schools and holding through springs and creating.
I've even my friends with my friends and I've been able to do the light, where we don't have some people who are not there, and I'm going to show you how to use them.
A year, I just a year, I just a junny who was the vather of his vather covered. I saw myself, and I saw myself, "I'm going to sit me," I'm going to sit."
And here I'm going to stand.
I thought with airplane, I was involved for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a great, I want to be airplane and pilot. That's my great dream.
From, I've got lions. But I can go through my experience, I can talk to my vather and the solution and the solution, and we can return the solution, and we can live without the solve without the solve without street.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I thank you very much.
You know, you know, you know, it's not like you're a story like your story.
So you're going to have this stip. Yeah.
You work on other electrical experiences.
What's the next thing on the lister?
My next experience, I worked on a real electrical caunctrical functroza. Onectrical caunctrozaun?
Yes, I know, electrical cities are hard to read, but I want to have my own.
You're almost it's trying to try and I'm trying to get you to switch, but the trying to read, because I got to get it.
All of antangle. Richard Turere, you're going to be a very bonderful bonderful.
We're going to be drawing your way to reference, my friends.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm an old enough, a camera in the hand, is Fotography, I want to tell you about 15, but I want to share with you 155 leaders, and no one of them.
There was no way of Director, no stilists, no chance, no chance to be a picture. Not sometimes the relationship.
And to be able to be able to be covered by the most common tourists.
My story starts as I was in New York was in New York was this picture, and my wife, and my daughter, and we were at my poor, we were at the first time. We were on my arm.
