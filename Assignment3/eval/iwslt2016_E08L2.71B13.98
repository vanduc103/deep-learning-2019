When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the sound of the sound of the guy.
My father heard on his little, gray, gray radio the news of BBC.
He looked very happy, very happy, which was pretty unusual, because the news, because the news.
He called "The Taliban are walking away!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father, but it made me happy.
"Well, you can go to a real school," he said," he said.
I'm not forget about to forget.
Actually, a real school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and spent itself, and spent it.
So I was smart, I five years, I five years, and I started my older sister sister sister sister, who didn't go to approach to a secret school.
And so we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way to do another way to do that, so that nobody was going to go.
We hidden our books in the books in the moment so that we would go to the same way we'd just a bought.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small well-minute.
In the winter was incredibly, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we all knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the repeated, the sudden, the sudden, because the Taliban, because the Taliban, because the Taliban.
We've never been sure how much they knew how much they knew what we knew.
Do they asked us?
Did they know where we live?
We had afraid, but we wanted to school.
I had a big happiness in a family in a family, in education as important and daughter.
My grandfather was his time.
Aside a cross from a found province Afghanistan. He was to send his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother was understanding.
My giving mother was teacher, but teacher.
This is her.
Two years ago, she went into the ruhest, just to challenge our house and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here's the first in his family who had ever been a school education.
For him was standing that his children would be a children would be a children, even his daughter, but his daughter, but it's daughter,
He looked like a much bigger risk of risk, his children don't go to school.
I know exactly that I'm sure that I was in the Taliban sometimes, by our lives, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective.
I was a good pattern, but my father said, "Thather said, "Thather, you can lose your life.
Your money can be done. You can be remote. You can be in war.
But one thing is going to stay, you're always being here. And even if we're going to pay for your blood for your blood for your blood for your blood, we'll have to do that.
So -- you're still going to still be up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that's been destroyed by decades.
Less than 6 percent of women have a higher than a higher than the second, and if my family. And if my family, and if my family for my school.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proudlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather who was involvather who was missed by his family, because he's been to school, because he was to school, one of the first, one of the first, one of the first, one of the first,
He doesn't just punch with my high school, but also I'm also the first woman, and I'm, and I'm, and I'm,
My family believes me.
I have a big dreams, but my family has greater trees for me.
So I'm a global message of a global message for 10x10, a global campaign of women.
So I've been helped to green SOLA to green, and maybe some internat for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls are still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students of my school with great ears with great ears with great ears.
And to see how their parents and fathers and fathers for me, as I'm going to be my parents for me, and I'm going to be able to make all the way.
So as Ahmed. That's not his face, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
All right now, he was his daughter, and heim on the home of SOLA in her village, and they're the streets of SOLA.
When he got home, he got home, and he sounded the phone, and he was going to sent him, if he sent to school, he would go to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "Till you want to say, "Till you want to sit down, but I'm not going to sit down the future of my daughters on the playing of your old predictions."
What Afghanistan, I realized something like this, I've been absolutely recognized, the most of us who are success, the success, the value of our daughter, and the value of his daughter, and it's success.
That's not hotters that our mothers don't play a lot of role in our success.
These are the people who are indeed, they're involved in a lot of possible for a lot of future, and they're in a society like the in a society like the in Afghanistan is the inevisible.
Our Taliban, just a few hundred girls -- because it was some hundred girl -- because it was the girl.
But today, but today, in Afghanistan about three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how we're such change.
I don't think that the change is not by during the Abancer and changes the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents that they're a lot of parents that they're going to see a lot of parents that they're going to see a lot of future and a long future.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unlimited possibilities, and I remember the girls, the girls, the SOLALALALALALALALAALALALALAALAAALALALAAAAAAAAAALA.
And just like I have a big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, even my life -- my life -- my life -- my life -- my life in Africa as young man.
In 1971 to 1971, I see young, but I'm not -- I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, the grands and Somalia, algeries and Somalia, with African countries of technical countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project that we put on the legs we've been on the legs,
I was turned.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people are good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we killed everything we started.
Our first project, what my first project, which is my first book called the Zambezi" inspired by the cambias, one that we wanted to show how food is built to show how food.
We came with Italian Saatgut in South South South South Sambia, which leads to Sambesi Fluss. We teached the south of the populational population and domata and domata and domata and domata and domata and domata and domata
Of course, the answer to the answer to the an interest in it, so we pay for the work, and sometimes they were doing it.
We were amazing that there was no country in a very early talent.
But instead of asking why they didn't look at why they were just saying, "God, we're just like, "God."
"Great, it's right now to save people save people to save people to save the connection."
Of course, all wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, we had this practice, they were so big, in Sambia, in Sambia,
We couldn't believe it and said, "Look at the sambian, like simple country."
When the tomates were red, and red, about night, about 200 nights from the river, and I asked everything.
We said to the Sambian, "Oh God, God, the Nilp food.
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a country, we don't have a country here."
"Why didn't you told us?" "You've never asked us."
I just thought we were so great in Italy was so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did what the Englands, what the Englands, I saw what they did. After I saw what they did.
We felt the nilparator of the Nilp food.
They should see the inside -- you should see the uncertainly, and you don't see anything else.
They should read the book "Dead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambic economist.
The book was published 2009.
We have the middle of African continent 1.5 trillion Euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has told you.
Lespare their book.
Lespond to a Africans that we've been approached.
We're westerns are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, and we're just two species, we're patriarchal.
Both words come from the latines," which means "pather" means "pather" means.
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalian: I'm treating everyone else of another culture. "I love you.
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone each one other culture, they would be my service.
So this is white people are called people in Africa, Chef, Chef, Chef,
I was growing up when I was after I was a book called "Small I was booking," he said, especially, if people don't want to help people don't want to go into the back.
This is the first principle of the help of the help.
The first principle of help is respect.
Today, the morning of the heart of the heart of this conference, a stab on the ground and asked, "Can you're going to imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react with people, and he was a system called companies, and he never motivation, no one has ever been motivated, but you'll never be motivated, but you're going to be the passenger passenger passengering the pion of the passengerychology of the pion that p
What you do -- you're doing -- you're going to do.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're set up with the collapse of the secrets.
We don't work from Books.
We meet in Caf<unk>s. We meet in Caf<unk>s.
We have no infrastructure.
We finally figured out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find.
The most important is the most important.
You can give someone an idea of a idea.
If these person doesn't like to do?
The passion for the passion for the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the passion for the most important of humanity.
We help them finding the knowledge, because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea of maybe not the knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this instead of saying, why don't wearing to say what they should do, why don't we hear them? But not to them? But not in communities.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with communities.
Internal Repected, and they're never going to say what they're going to tell their money to see what they want to see what they're seeing for possibilities.
Planation has this blind flind.
The most clearest people of the community, because they never know that they never seem to be able to see.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, a social infrastructure that doesn't exists who are not existed.
A new profession has to be created.
This is the house of the companies, the house of the bed, who's in the house, who's in your caf" and in the caf<unk> to help you help you help you help your passion in a way that life to transform your passion in a way that life.
I've been tried to do this in the West Australia, trying to try to try to do this.
I was promoved to the time and trying to get out of the time and trying to say what they should do.
And so I just went through the first year, and I had to help us in the first three days, and I'm going to help him. He was him. He was called him. He was Maori. I him, and I'm him, and I'm going to sell themselves and selling themselves.
I'm going to work with these fisheries, and I don't help us to sell them, and I don't have a factory in Albany for 60 cents<unk>Kilo.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I'm holding the mouth and hope."
So -- -- so -- so, the government, "Make it again."
We've done it in 300 communities.
We've been founded 40,000 companies.
There's a new generation of companies that are involved in a sense.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, one of the story, story, story, a few years ago.
Peter pressor was philosophy professor, before he was businessor, and he said, "Peter pressure, Peter pressure, in reality and in reality."
Planation is the death is the death of the entrepreneurs.
So you build Christch, without know what the most clearly human Christch without their money and their energy and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get this.
You have to give them discretion and privacy and privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them, and they're going to be hard.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
So for what presentation is, you've most applauded on the morning?
<unk>respite, empty people. They have applause.
I want to say that companies are the right way of the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial Revolution -- novels, fossil fossil fuels, and suddenly there are suddenly systems that are not sustainable.
The conservation of power machine is not sustainable.
The Freon-Artt is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we have to look at seven billion people on sustainable ways, holds, corresponding, and we can corresponding them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will this technology for the green revolution? Universities? Universities?
The government? Can you're forget!
It's going to be entrepreneurs now.
I read a great story in a futuristic magazine a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to city the future of New York in 1860.
In 1860, they came together and speculated in 100 years with the city of New York, the city was a slow. The city was a city: The city was not existing in 100 years.
Why? They saw the curve, and they said, if the population in this tempox, they needed six million population, they needed to be six millions of path, and it would be impossible to be able to be able to finish.
Because they went on the mistakes.
1860, they see the bad technology that life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there was 1001, there was 1001, 1001.
The idea of a different technology, a different technology, the race. There was tiny little factory in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
As first, first of all, they're being used to be both.
And they don't come and talk to you.
So next thing you have to do is absolutely engaged and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the smallest company, all of the biggest company, three things that need to be selling: That's to be selling production, the market, and the financial and the financial and the financial.
Do you guess?
We never met a single person who can sell a little person who can sell a little bit of money, and we're going to sell the money.
It's not exists not.
This person was born.
We've been looking at the research and we looked at the world, we looked at the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google,
There's only one thing that all successful companies have been a communities of just a person. No one: No one person.
Now we teach 16-year-old in Northumberland companies, and we started to start the business, and we're going to give them the first two sides of Richard Branon Autobiography of the first two pages of the first two pages of the first two pages of the first two page of the first two p
No one of the "ich" and 32 times "wir" and 32 times.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody green a company. No one company. No one.
So can we create a community, in the middle of a smaller, who have a little bit of a sitting in Caf<unk>s and Bars and Bars, and they're going to do what someone who's going to do for them to do for this gentleman who has done to young people who's talk about this eposemics talk
What can you make it? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you sell on the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't you." "Mo, I think I'm going to figure out?"
We activate communities.
We only have groups of volunteers who are supporting the companies of their powerful people, and we're going to help them to help them. We've found that the wonder of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economy, and the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be, as it's probably being wonderful.
The Penn State University, a Doccent in communication -- a distribution -- in communication -- to expective communication.
I had afraid of afraid.
Rightfared. Fear of these students with their great brains and their great brains and their great big big big big big big big big big big big big big big books.
But when they developed the conversation, he was like Alice, when they looked down to the Canincer, and a door, and a door to a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I was conversation with the students, and I was amazing. I was amazing about the thought that they had to discover the other wonderful country.
I think to open this door to open this door, it meant to opening.
We need to have a great communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the biggest problems, like the largest problems, and health, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and I don't think it's nothing about it. I think it's nothing in our responsibility.
But this great conversation is not to understand when our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, please.
I want to show you a few ants that we can see how to do it, we can see that we can see that the science and technology, and the technology, sexy and spaneously.
The first question that you have to answer is, is, is, right?
Says us, why you're just so research scientific areas.
I don't just suggesting that their dragon, but also tell us that their drawings, that you can also treat them in our bone, because it's important structure, because it's important to understand oil.
And if you do that, what you do is doing, then you're going to be avoided.
Afterwards are a hands of your minds.
If you could use your doctors, and as a result, but why don't you say, why don't you just understand what's a lot of time, what's a lot of us?
Our thoughts your thoughts, is not the same as their nive.
As affection said, "Mache the things like this, "Mach things like possible -- but not easier."
You can tell us something about your science is something about your scientific areas, without being a compromise without it.
A few things are intention to cover, examples, stories, stories and analogies.
And if you're presented, then the stories, then the stories.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stichpunct"?
What happens when someone else? Another one of the other people, and then you're going to be the first plots, and with these points.
A slide of this is not just long, but it's also long, but also too much on the language of our brains, and we're involved in our brain.
This example of genes of genes of genes is much more effective, and it's much more effective structure of the trabele of the trabele of the trabele of the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration for the egggggggggging.
The trick here is to use a single simple sentence, just reading the audience, when it's audience, orientation can be losing the fact that can be used to read pictures and graphics that are also a deeply changing the other senses of a deepth of deep.
These are just a few ants that can help us to see these door, and the door, and the wonderful and the technology and technology and technology.
And the engineers I've been teaching me, I've been taught me, "Nerd in me," I want to make anything with a same contact with a same.
And what's happening is, you know, your science and your minds, and your multiple, so that's the relevance, so the audience, and multiplicated the whole thing that is important to their own work.
So scientists and engineers and engineers, if you're solved me, it's sounds me.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handyridge, you can films in Syria.
With a handy, you can tweet a message in Egyptize a protestaction in Egyptian.
And with a handy, you can take a song, it's high-loud and famously.
All of this is possible.
I'm a year in 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in these city.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people, for change in the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989, and we're in 1989 and asked all these people who had to change a handy in the pocket.
Who is a handy on the same handy on the same?
Have it up.
Have your hand phones, you're high!
Have it. One is. One other people, a blackberry, wow.
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 35.830 cave full information.
Rohdata.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U. commission is a direction.
This direction is called Rightline is called the current purpose.
This direction is that every phone is that every phone in Europe, every single Internetdia, every Internetdia, a bandwidth of bandwidth of bandwidth.
Who is it going to be? Who is it? Who is it a email?
Who do you send a text?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are at least six months to two years of your phoneths of your phoney or your phoney or your Internetanbieter.
And everywhere in Europe are the people on Europe, and we don't want to say, "That's not going to want to do."
They said, we're going to do this idea of course,
We want to be self-certainly trying to digital age, and we don't want to be the phone and Internet and Internet, and we need to special information about us.
There were an applies, Journalists, Priester who said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of blines and said, "Freedom, "Freedom."
And some people say, this could be the stasium, this could be 2.0.
The state was the secrets in East East.
And I'm asking me if this really works really working.
Can you really all these information about us information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone called my phone called German telecom that was the greatest telecom that was the greatest phone, and I asked her, and I asked her all information that I'd asked me to me.
And I asked her, she asked her, and I didn't get right answer. Nural Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life, because it's my life.
So I decided to do a point of views, they wanted to have this information because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said, no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a compared to them.
I'm going to go back to the ancestors where they're all sending me.
Because in the twish of the boundary pollution of the E.U.
So I got this half of this half of the half of the cD.
And on the CD was this.
35th,830 columns.
First, I saw it, and I said, it's a huge datei.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months in this diatei.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I start with it?
Because you see where I'm, where I'm sleeping, what I do.
But then I said to me, I want to go to the public.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people what I want to show what it means.
So with time, with time, and Online and Open Data City.
This is a visualization of six months.
You can reincooms and out and out and out and you can push it and back.
You can make every step that I do, you can do.
And you can see how I can see how I'm going to see how many tags with the stuff, and how many tasks, and how many a call.
All of this information is possible.
This is a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, it's just as I called my wife, and we talked me, and we talked to each other.
And then I called me a few friends, and they call apart.
And after a while you're calling you and you call it, and we've got this huge communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they're going to go to apart to bring them to bed.
You can see all this.
You know, you're going to see the central figures, like the leaders of the group.
If you have access to these information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect defect developing how to make a society, because you know who's talking about who is who are talking about who is possible when you're possible when you have access to these information.
And this information are being six months, at least six months, in Europe.
As I started to say, we're going to imagine all these people in the streets in the street in 1989 cell phones in 1989 cell phones.
And the state of the state of who had been in the demonstration of the demonstration, and if the state, and if the state, then maybe that would never happen.
The case of the mountain master might have not states.
And also, even though, the case of the ice case of the ice.
Because today, because of the state and companies like so many information, how many information, how they can get to us, online.
They want to follow our opportunity to refuse our lives, and they want to remain the long species.
But even self-cretation and a life in the digital time in the digital time.
But you have to fight for the self-crete for the self-controlling.
You have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you say, you're friends, you're a value of the 21st century is not old median.
If you go home, you say, you're going to say, just because companies, just because companies, and state the possibility, they don't have to store it.
And if you don't believe me, you're asking your phone calls that they've been talking about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you use your handy, you remember the self-conforestation in digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoes, fastaurants, broke broke, broke broke.
So the city planers are hits, and we're survive the names South Central South Central, so it's changed it in South Los Angeles, when it's going to change what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spiritual, fastaurants, fastaurants, bridge.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the foods, I live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the Driva and the drive-by.
The comics is that the drive-thruses more people killed than the drive bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles,
The fatty is in my fatheries in my fourth is about five times more than about 15 kilometers, which is about 15 kilometers,
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how to feel like you wouldn't have access to healthy food, if you'd have to go out of the house, if you look like the negative impacts that are negative impacts that has the best effects of your food system.
I'm going to sell that role, and I selled and sellings like buyings.
I see dialysiscysecentary emporate like Starbucks.
And I've been able to stop that this is.
I realized that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And also, I had no lustered to 45 minutes appledge to get an apple to get an apple to get a pesticides in presented in presented.
So I plant a food week, I was a food forest.
It's a piece of land that we call parkanles.
It's 45,000 feet.
The thing is, the thing is, it's the city.
But you have to path.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to kep it in stand."
And I decided to hold it in standard.
So I got and my group that my group that L.A. Green grounds, and we started together, and we started to plants, and own program, soon, so that's all the program, so that's all program.
We're a kind of imagination group, and we're made of gardening all the social signs and all of the city, it's completely freezing, and everything we're doing, is cost.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone who was a guy.
The city came up to me and he told me, and he told me, and he said that I had to tell my gardening, the prevention.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A rich interesting a rich piece of food production, is deadly not to a piece of land, is not a greater?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her with this."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times, Wind, Wind, Steve Lopez, and he was talking about it, and talked to the city and talk to a member of Green Green Green Green Green Green and 900 in Changing.
We thought in the hands.
My city gave me, and he said that they're support them, and I love what we do.
So why would they shouldn't it?
L.A.A. in the United States, most bridge of the city of the city of the city.
They're 67 kilometers.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flowing around 725 million tomates plants.
Why would they find that, why don't you find it?
And by the terms of a plants, you get 1,000 sames.
With board boat in the value of a dollars on a dollars and green own value.
It's my holy, I say, I'm going to build their own food.
His own food is like to build your own money to pressure.
Look, I have a powerful powerful.
I grew up there. I've been my sons there.
And I'm smart, part of this imagined reality to be shown by other people who were made by other people, and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I plant my art.
And just like a graffiti coasts, the walls, the walls, I'm beautiful, I'm a parkanles.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of pieces, and the trees are my dreams for these struggle.
They would be surprised what the Earth can use it as a legs as a legs.
You can't imagine how amazing a sun, and how they're touched, and how they're touching people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my gardening my gardening and the relationship and the result of my fourth.
To change the community to change the community of the ground of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wondering how kids are being influenced by it.
Garden is the therapistic and careful action that you can do, especially with the city.
And you can get the expression of the earthquake.
I remember this time when this time, when these mother and her daughter and her daughters, and they were in my garden, and I got it out in my garden, and I came out.
I'm really feeling bad, because they were there, and I said, "Well, and I said, "Well, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been thinking about when I saw people who were so close to me, and I've been as close to do this. And I'm just asking me, people asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid, you're not going to be food."
And I said, "There's no, no, no, no, I don't think they're not afraid.
And it's the street on the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but I want them to take them back to the same time I want them to take their health."
At the other time, I was a garden in this obsession in this obsession in Downtown L.A.
These are the guys who have helped me to definitely.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it has been plants, and how they've plants and how they've plants and see it was great, and it was great for a moment.
Green Green Garden has plants for about 20 garden.
To our environmental actions came up with 50 people and they were all freedom, and they're all volunteers.
If children carbon, it's eating children carbon.
If they're tomates, they eat.
But if they don't get anything about it when they don't get together when they don't get to eating and body and body, they're blind, they're blind, they're blind,
I see young people who want to work, but they're working in this thing -- I see -- I see -- I see, the color that's exactly on the path, and they're not seen for them.
The gardens, I see as a children, where we can train themselves to care their communities to care their communities to make a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carververton Carververton Carverton Carver.
But if we don't change the collection of the Earth, we will never change that we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole we can share a whole plants, where people can share the same block.
I want to take shipscontainer and turn them into healthy caf<unk>s.
So, don't understand me.
I'm not talking about costless sustainable, because free.
The comics is that you have to be ability to stop them through them.
I'm talking about it, people's working, and children of the streets, and they're going to get the streets and the honor and the honor, and when you build the core, and when you build business, and when you open business.
So what I want to do is to do is to do is to make sexy.
I want to say that we all ecological rebells, gangster, gangster gangster garden.
We have to reach the picture of ganger.
If you don't have a gangster.
Gangster is, you're going to go to the smell, right?
And let's make the weapon of your choice.
If you want to make meet meeting, you don't want to make meeting in the caves and make a meeting and make a meeting, and a meeting, anything about it.
If you want to meet meet you, you're going to get your garden, so we can plant to get some sort of snows.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the whole Oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "It's not inevitable politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a time, a better definition of definition, "Ein Snollygoster is someone who is a guy, independently, independently, program or lady, program or line, and his success, and the power of the power of power.
I don't know what "pecheral" is.
And I think that's kind of words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians know that they're trying to control the language.
For example, for example, third loud the British Parlament, not the exactly the exact same words.
And that was actually back to the mother was actually back to the mother of a man's extraordinary names of Crosby, who was involved with the plament.
They were open it in the Tower of London, but he was a mutigrade, he was mutigrade, he was mutigrating, and he was so much in London, and he was so much in London, he was so much in London that he won.
And only a few years later, we find the first news for the first news for the first news, like Brass."
Brassing on the English word for blech.
But that's not true. It's not true to a return to a press.
But to show you how words are laws and politics, I want to take you to take you to the U.S., when they're just going to be independently the independence.
You saw the question of what you should say, how to be a state, the state of Washington,
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a republic nation?
And that's been debate in Congressed in the Congress.
And there were all sorts of possible processes.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouverneur Washington, and other, others, and other, others, and other, others, and other, others of the United States of America'shington.
Not so a presence.
Some people wanted to call it King it.
They thought that's been during the same.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king of time.
It would have worked.
But everybody was incredibly shared because this debate, because this debate 3 weeks.
I've leading the days of a senator who wrote a same is, "Immer's the same issue.
The reason for the population and the long tissue was that the representation was that the senat.
The representants didn't want to be that Washington'ton, and they didn't want to do it.
Could call it, and I'm going to take it on ideas to be able to bring its neighborhood.
They wanted to give him the most powerful, yes, you know, the most possible title.
This title was "President."
President. They don't have the title. He didn't existed. But he's suffering someone of a transportation.
It's like a Jury.
He had no longer size, as the terms of "Ancer" or "Aufpasser."
Sometimes, there were president smaller community and governments and governments, but it was really an infant titled titled title.
So this is why the senatures.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it President.
This guy has to write approaches and out of the countries and out of the countries.
Who will take it for the first time he's going to take a thumbs of the United States like President of America?"
And also, after 3 weeks, the senate of senate.
Instead, you know, we're not going to use the title of the power of the case, but they wanted to make sure that they didn't want to be absolutely approach to the own practices and methods and methods and methods.
You can learn from three interesting things.
First, I think that's what I think about -- until now, I don't have the senates that have ever been once the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just given the title of the senatisfy.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says that something temporary -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- then you know,
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title "President of the United States of America, right?
This has more than 5,000 nuclears of nuclears that he has a biggest people who he has a photte volcular drones and a photte drones and a photte drone.
It's really giving the title of the title of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the si
And so the senat at the end of the end.
They've got a respectable title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of property -- now it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the cling of the climbing of the 5,000 nuclear power.
So at the end of the senat and the representation of the representation, because no one has been told if you're going to be a word that you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take with, and with.
Politicians trying to use words to environment and the reality, but actually changing the reality, but actually changing the reality words, the reality of reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelling about 50 rebelling a campaign to Dian surfer, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I thousands of my black cell phone company, a couple of color, and I could see a rocket and celebration of the government of governments I couldn't even see.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I was a long time, I was biggest, and I was a pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama-state children and religionalists and religionalists.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm asking you, I'm going to be southeast Afghane, Southeist God, atheist and atheist and atheist and atheist artists who are recently nine years in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do a lot of great things that you could do, but I don't like to make a rainforestation, I want to make the personality, and I want to make the personality and cars.
I want to spend a day in life of a dihad -- Gangster, who's done to his districts like <unk>Popstar Bling" and popstar Bling" and political corruption and political corruptions.
And what's happening to make the Dihad gangster than creating a parliament and make a choice, and I'm going to make me! I'm doing, "Well, I'm doing."
And trying to use these campaigns to use these magnitude that are as a national system.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan on the reason, and they're going to take a project called "Rast," and they're going to take a wrong controlled themselves in the streets of cabulars and cabularly on the streets, but in the streetside of the streets.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistanistanistanistan conflict in Afghanistan conflict.
The war, and the free of approaches that came with him, and they created a new environment for style and models that you can only a models that you can only a model of soldiers and self-modecide in the fellows, in the Africa, in the Africa,
And I'd like to see how a simple simple cabulative cabulation of cabulation, and then we can do a dialogue of 18999, that the process of creating a dialogue of their designs in the pasticies of the broadcasts of the broadcastic rhethoration of the browork
But for all of these things, you can get in prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be missing.
But I have to do it because I have to do because I have to lose the geography of self-like.
That's my last. What is your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and sincell and I've been working as a model.
Since 10 years, right?
I have the sense of the space is now in the room, because I wouldn't have a unexpected to do this clothes.
Fortunately, I've been a little bit of a change.
This is the first time that you can see someone on the TED stage, you can see, so you can see, so you can see, so I think you can see.
If you really get a few women were really explained when I wasn't need to say that now, I'm not to say that I'm later.
I also realized that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very shortly, because I can think about what you think about me.
And that's not all the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I wanted to be such as I wanted to be able to wear.
The most difficult part is to pullover the pullover over my head, because then you'll be able to do all of you, so long as head, so long as head.
In order to go.
Why do I do that now?
That was pleasure.
Now, it wasn't hopefully like this picture.
As a powerful, but an image is also a surface.
I've just changed your opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer, I would be solved my back and with my hair in the hair.
And then, from operations or the wrong breaks, or the wrong bridge that I had two days ago, there's only very few possibilities, and our exceptions, and our extraordinary -- although it's own lives.
From the way to be honest for me to be honest.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a hope, and I know, and in my broke, and in my breaks a sexy girls.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me to the real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means nothing means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, is a message in the genetic lottery and maybe you're asking what this experience, and maybe you're asking.
Now, in the last few centuries, we've not only been defined, and young and young and symmetrically programmed, but also, we're biological programmed, but also as big, feminally, feminally, feminally.
This experience was created. And it's a sense that's a result.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liuws."
And then I'm going to comment your model-called. Very.
But unfortunately, I have to share that in 2007, a very extractorand of NYU all the models on the walk of the NYU all the medical path, and that was booked, and that was only 27 or less than four percent of the 67 or less than four percent.
The next question that I'm always asked me, "Can I'm a model, if I'm a model?"
And then I said, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls really want to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all going to be.
You can be president of the U.S. or the inventor of the next Internets or a ninja-hear-hear-signer, because then you would be dead, because then you would be the first."
If they're still saying, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no," I want to say, "Who," then I'm like, "Who's my head."
Because I don't have responsibility and you couldn't be the carbon of American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next sentence of H<unk>amp;M or the next sentves Meisel.
And you say that you want to be a model, you're going to say that you would say that you'd like to say that you want to win the Jackpotto.
You can't be influence it, and it's not a career, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to give you 10 years to give you 10 years, because of the monstrate of the heart of the heart of heart, it's just just just just as a heart.
If there's a photograph, and the light, and then you're just like a nice, and the customeron, and the customeron, and then we want to be a photo in the walk, and then you go to the legs, this arm, this arm, this arm, this arm, this arm, this arm, this arm, this poor
It looks like this.
Hopefully, more comic than that.
That was ... I don't know what happens.
If you're going to school and a lifetime, and a few jobs, you can't be sorry, you can't be much. If you want to be presidentin of the U.S., but in life, "10 years," you're going to go to come to come to come to come to come to come to come to come to
The next question that I'm often asked me, "Who are all photos of photos?
And yes, so, all photos are all photos, but that's just a small part of the gift.
This is the first photo that I've done that I didn't even have this was also the first time I was a bicine. I had a bikiniode.
I know that's pretty personally personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me at the day, this shooting.
My friends had to stay with me.
This is me on a pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama for the French virogue.
This is me with the football team and in the V-Team and in the V-Magazine.
And that's me.
And I hope you can see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's constructs and it's constructs of profession, from profession, from Hairstylists and Make-up artists and stylists and stylists and stylists and the advantage and the advantage.
Okay, when you ask me, people ask me, "We're always asking me?"
Yes, I have too many 20-cm-cmazine that I can never wear the things I've never getting things that I'm greater, but the things I'm bit about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went to a day, and I went to a laden, and I had forgotten me to forget the clothes.
As a teenager, I was in my friends with my friend, and they were a ride, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and it's a guilty, and we could go, and we could go on, and we could go on.
I've got this cost of my personality, and I don't get to my personality and there's people who are personality and not because of their personality and not personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were filmed in the last decided, 85 percent swaren and latinos and latinos and latinos and latinos and mostly men.
It's only 17,000 young, only 17,000 young, men and latino, and latino, "Who I'm saying, "Who I do it?"
But what I'm going to do I'm going to give? When I'm going to stop?"
In my rights, I found out that talked about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of their body. And these numbers are not paying at 78 percent when they're 178 percent when they're 178 percent when they're 178 percent.
The last question is, "How is it, how is it to be a model to be a model?"
And I think they're expect these answer, "If you're a little bit more thinner, and behavior, you feel very happy, you feel very happy and fabulous and fabulous, and fabulous,"
And Backstage, we give answer that might be able to probably this impression.
We say, "It's really great, and it's greative, and it's greative, inspired, inspired people."
All that's true, but it's just the story, because what we never saw, because what we never say, "I'm never told me what I've never say, "I feel better."
And I feel like I'm sure because I have to think about my exception.
And if you ever ask yourself, "What do I think if I'd be happy when I had thinner legs and believe?"
Then you should make a few models because they've got the thin, because they're the most thin, and the most coolest powerful guys and the coolest clamothes of their exception on the planet.
When I wasn't always been a very difficult to make a very difficult to make a real picture, because one of the piece of a very honest, I felt very uncomfortable, and say, "I'm going to be a stack of my guns.
It was very difficult to be a very difficulty, a repression of university and race of opening, if I'm one of the biggest use of it.
But I'm also happy and feeling, and I'm going to be here, and I think it's great that I think it's great that I've been able to tell you about 10 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 30 years, because I wouldn't tell me how I wouldn't tell me how I'm not tell youn't tell
If you take a little bit of this talk, then we're all the power of imagination in our power of imagination and mistakes and mistakes more.
Thank you.
I've never forget the words of my grandmother, who's been in exilience, "Son, list of life, affordable gaddafire.
But who never will never be like a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, almost two years, the libysche revolution is inspired by the waves of the waves of the waves of the waves in the Egyptian revolution.
I spent myself with many other Libyern, with many other libyers, and outside Libyens to a day of the Zorns and to start a revolution to start a revolution to start a regime Gadaffis.
And it was, she was a big revolution.
Now, libysche, liby women and men stood in the first series of the regimes, hold slogans of the rules of the freedom, for social justice, for the air.
They've been asked for example, by using the brutal dictature Gaddafishing gaddafishing.
They've shown sense of solidarity, from the farming east, from the farmers, until the south.
Finally, after after a time of six months and almost 50,000 tags, and almost 50,000 tyrants and the guy and the guy.
But Gaddafi, but a big citizens, a great big basically, the guy, the corruption and the basically for course.
Over four decades, Gaddafis is a gaddafis, and the infrastructure, and the infrastructure of the lybic structure of the lybic society.
The consciousness and the challenges, I found myself, I burned to build the civil society, and we could repeated a lot of other women. We're going to reporting a civilizational equality and neveral equality.
So in 200 organizations were during and unmed and unmediate, and unmedical Gaddafishing in Benghazi.
After 33 years in exil, I got back to Lybia, and I started to Lybia, and I started to the subjection, I started to the subjection, human development and leaderships and leaderships.
With a wonderful group of women, I women, I women, I women, a movement of women, a movement of women, leaderships, and it's public transportation for sociope.
I met the policies, I met on a very difficult environment, a polarized, a polarized. A environment, and a politics of the egoistic politics of Dominance and exclusion.
I was a slide of the peace of peace and choice, and I'm achievement of women to reach a laws, a law that every citizens, no matter, no matter, and we should be a both of the right and citizens and citizens.
At the end of our initiative and successful.
Women women women women in the Nationalalkongresses in the first choice of 52 years.
But long, but the euphories of euphories and the whole revolution of choice, we wake up to new news of violence.
A lot of morning, we growed to the money, weak about change mosques and sufi-grain.
In another morning, we got news about the message of American message and the attacks and the attack on the message.
Again, again, the morning of officiences of officients.
And really, we're really growing up under the milixing and their opportunity of military and their power and their power and their power and laws and laws and laws and laws and laws and laws.
Our society, against a revolutionary polarized, polarized by the ideal and discovered by the ideal and principles and principles, social Geness, social generality.
Intolerance, exclusion, and roaches were revolution.
I'm not there today today with the success story of our remarkable story, and the choice of our remains and choice.
A lot of me today, I'm here today, as a nation that we're met the wrong choice and the wrong choice.
We've been putting our priorities.
Because the choice needed written for wars or security or security in Lybia.
Hat the rip of the rivers and the way between female and the way between female candidates and national powerful candidates?
No, she didn't.
What is it?
Why is our society is polarized by our society and dominant politics of dominance and the exclusion of men and the exclusion of men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been missing, but the female values of the female of the middle of the inside of the including and the gnade.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consumer society, and consumer than they're just the polarization and discovery and discovery and discovery.
Our society needs to be qualitative connection of the female of the female, quantitative requires.
We have to stop in the name of the zorns and a day of the roach and a day of the roach.
We have to start in the name of the compassion and the gnade and the gnade.
We have to develop a female discourse that wouldn't just following the following words, but also too, instead of rather than instead of working on the statts, instead of statts, instead of statts.
These are the ideal that crime that a void of war, the war.
Because the peace has a alchemic and in this alchemic and in this alchemistry of feminal sightly, and machine.
This is the real retirement.
And we have to use existence we have to do it before we do it.
After a transportation of the Coran "Salam" -- "the" -- "the-time God, raw, raw.
The word "mheem" again," and all of the same of all the same assignment, the same Arabic terms like the word "mom" and symbolized the word "mbolized the whole feminal feminal feminal feminality, and the whole patherspective of the wholeg
And just like the motherleible for the embryo, who grows up in him, completely the basically the reason is the whole existence of the compassion.
So this is why we said, "My Gnade, all of these things."
So this is why we said, "My Gnade has been a prediction of my grand."
Well, we all have the guns of the gnade of the grand.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country was the best of the world, and I grew up with the songs."
And I was very proud.
In school, we realized the story of Kim Il-shapan, but we don't learned a lot about the world, except that America, South Korea, South Korea and Japan.
Although I was often asked me how the outside often, I thought I'd like to spend my whole life in North Korea to a whole life.
And I saw years, I saw a public habitat, but I thought, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to live in myself.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter of warf with, from the sister of a college.
And the thing: "If you read this, we're going to be five family members, because we've been for two weeks, because we've been for two weeks.
We're going together on the ground and our body are soon as well as well as well."
I was so shocked.
I heard about the first time, I heard that people in my country.
And I went to the board of the Bahnhofully, and I didn't see anymore.
A living woman launched on the ground, and a absolute child in their arm, and aid in their mother.
But no one would help them because all of them because all of them were so carefully to care about itself and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hungernot in North Korea.
At the end of the end of north Koreans of the hunger of the hungernot to the victims, and many more survival, because they're just because they're battle.
In fact, it's always been highly harmed, so that's all dots, except the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the side of the environment.
I always asked me why they had lights and we didn't have.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the river, the river, the part of the border between North Korea and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and Ch
As you can see, the river, the rivers, and it's impossible and allowed the flights.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't say much about how I can say North Korea, but I can say that I can say that I can tell the hungernotically changed china.
I thought that I thought I was a short time of my family.
I never thought that it's 14 years to live together together.
In China, it was very hard to live as young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be like the life as north Korean fleeping. But basically, but as I think it's not just extremely dangerous, but also, but also, but also, but also, because north Koreanese flights.
So I lived in the strongest fear that my real identity, and you would be able to fly in a terrible sends of North Korea.
One day, my greater alptraum was true when I was bigger than I was brought by the Chinese police and in the police.
Someone was to be a north Koreaner, so they test my chinese, so they test my chinese and asked me to be my chosens.
I had this fear, I thought I thought I was exploding.
Would be sort of course, I could be seemed, I could be innovation and absolutely and absolutely.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I could make it, but I could make it feels to control the questions.
After she was finished with the experience said, "That was a false, a false.
It's not a north Korean."
And they let me go. It was a wonderful.
Some North Korean in China in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had girls.
Although they were expanded, they were free, they were free, they were able to international pressure international pressure.
These north Korean, not so much happiness.
Every year, every year, uncoreans are being related in China, and after North Korea, where they're followed or public, or public.
Although I had lucky, I had a lot of other north Koreans don't know.
It's tragic that North Koreans are missing their identity and hard to survive.
And then after they've learned a new language, and work in a moment on a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the hidden of the hidden, I decided to go to South Korea, and again.
Mich in South Korea never metrate, was a greater challenge, when I thought it.
English was so important that I had to start to learn to learn to learn to learn.
And I've been a big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all the Koreans, but inside the inside, we've been very completely 67 years of part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of 67 years.
Identity, Identity.
Bin Is South or North Korean?
Where am I? Who am I?
And then there was no country, there was no country that my home.
Although I was approaching me to the south Korean life, I had a plan.
I was already for the task of the university.
And I was asked me to my new life, I would have a horrible life.
The North Korean Behind, the money I started to sent my family, and as a punishment, and as a punishment, and as a punished place on the country.
They had to fast as possible as possible to plan to plan.
North Koreaner has to be an incredible streets on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to over the border between North Korea, Ironically to China and I took a plane, and I was doing a plane to China and made me to the North Koreanese border.
Because my family, I had to talk about a chinese, I had to sites, and then I had to southern China and then after Southeastasia.
The bus driver is a week, and we've been able to get more multiple.
Once the bus once was a chinese police, a Chinese police came in.
He took the exercise of all, and he started asking questions.
And I didn't understood a chinese family, I thought they'd being told me.
When the Chinese practic family, I decided told him, and I decided to him, and I would believe her attention.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, he believed me.
We did it to the laotic border, but I had to start to border, almost all my money to borders of Laos.
But even after we had the borders, my family, my family in the family, because illegal borders.
After I had payed money, and shortly, my family, my family inside a month, but I was family. But my family. But my family.
This was one of the biggest pulling my life.
I had done to do everything to family to freedom to freedom, and we were so close to the family, but my family, just before the southern Corean message.
I went down and I went out between the police and the police and trying to doubt, and I tried to struggle, but I had no enough money to pay for payments.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man, "What's going to go?"
I was completely surprised that a friend of it.
In broken English and with a words and I started to explain my situation and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two other numbers of money and two other north Korean, and two other north Korean.
I thanked him from all heart, and I asked him, "Why do you?"
"I don't help you," he was.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The reviews of friends, and he took a new hope for me, and he took the North Koreans, and he showed me the friends and he showed me the friendness of free and the support of foreign and the international community as the northern community as the northern community as
Finally, after our long journey, my family, and I returned to south Korea, but the freedom.
Many North Koreans are being done by their families, and as soon as they go to a new country, they're not going to start with little bit or not a money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us to education and a lot more.
We can also be the bridge of his bridge between the outside of us in North Korea, because many of us in contact with family, and we're going to send them information and money, North Korea, North Korea.
I had a happiness, so much help and inspiration inspiration in my life that I hope that I'm hopeful north Koreans, with international success.
I'm sure you're a lot more successful north Koreaner on the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've only one please.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very well.
It can't talk about, but he's communicating for a kind of how it couldn't be a few of the best speakers.
Remi white love is.
He's shared it means, and he's participate it.
It's not a bit of it. He's not on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and imagine that he's never talking about a lies.
If he's songs from our childhood, trying to remember that I don't even remember one thing: how little we know about the understanding of how little we know about the understanding of the understanding of the unknown.
Samuel is 16th. It's very good. It's very good.
He's a absolutely incredible memory.
But he also has a selective.
He can't remember if he was slavery, he's remembers, but he remembers of public transportation, conversation of every songs that we had a four, as four, as four, as the most four, as the most public four arms of all the bottle of the bottlet
Did they don't hear incredible?
But many people are not true.
And in fact, because their minds don't understand in social version of normal version often understanding and wrong.
But what my heart attacked and my soul, and my soul, although this was the case, although they were not as a case, even though they couldn't be autism, that it was just autistic and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so carrying that are not so carrying with the term, it's a complex faction of the brain, which is a complex faction of the brain that are social communication, and sometimes learning.
It's extremely different individual, it's remio, it's like this.
And global world is going to be all 20 minutes at a new person autism, and although there's one of the most fastest growing developments of the world, there's no known for the world, or healing or healing or healing or healing or healing or healing or healing.
And I can't remember the first time I'm not autism, but I can't remember, but I can't remember it.
I was born three years old, when my brother when my brother, and I was even born, and I was even a new west in my life.
And after a few months, he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and actually, he wasn't really interested in me.
Remi, and he lived in his own world, with his own world, and he found found founding on the smallest things, like the smallest things in a series of the room in a series of the space of the space of what it washing to eat.
And when he was older, he was different, he was different, and the differences were invisible.
But behind the wutanted and the frust and the frust and the frustration was something really unique hyperactivity: a reine and innocent nature, a boy, a boy that had never been a boy who had never been a human who had never been a human who had never been lost.
And also, extraordinary.
Now, I can't learn that there were some figured out there were some moments in my family, moments I wish I would believe they were like I would be like I would be.
But I'm going to learn the idea that they've taught me to the things that they're going to understand communication and love, and I don't understand that these things I wouldn't want to be normality.
Normality is about beauty that we're given us, and the fact that we're not different, and the fact that we're not that one of us.
It means that there's another way of right.
And if I could say one thing to Remi, and to Sam and to you, and then it wouldn't be normal.
You're also being aware of it.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a gift, we have a gift, and in all of us. And in all of us, and in all the early, the ultimate opened by potential.
The chance of chance, progress and change the progress and change in which we're trying to be different.
Please -- say, I'm not saying that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has gone us with edggs and curiosity with this photo on the photo on the applement of applement and a million times of just a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and see the world, and see the world, but a million pictures per seconds per seconds.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography, the femto-Fiction technique technique technique that they can make time to make time to make time to make time.
And so we can build cameras, we can look at the absolutely, we can look at editors, or without a <unk>-ray body in our body, and really in our body, and really in question, and really in question.
If I'm going to take a laser potentially, and I'm going to take a billion seconds -- that's more femtocols -- that's a package of photon, and this photon, and this photon, and this photon project, and this photon-power, this project.
So if you take this project, this photones, this photones, and it's going to be in these flaps, how are these photon in the flower?
What's light in time light?
So this whole event events.
So, think about it, you think that's actually less than a nanosecond, it's less than a nanosecond, so light to return this streets -- but I'm light, but I'm lose the factor of this video to see the factor of the factor of the light.
No, Coca-Cola Coca-Cola has not funding.
So in this movie, so much, so let me show you what happens to show you what happens.
The Puls, our project, our project, we drive a photonpaket, and that starts to move, and that's start to move, and that's finally inside.
A part of the light, after the table, and you see these exciting and you see these exciting.
Many of the photones of photones, the rich last, the rivers of the flowers and exploding directions.
As you can see, there's air, which is air, which is in the flap.
As afterests are broads on the table and white the table and because of the reflexions of the reflexions of the rivers of the rivers on the end of the rivers.
If you take a project, and if you take the same streets and let it go back to the same streets and the video, and you know, you know how long you have to see how long you have to see how long you have to see the movie?
All right, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long film -- from a slow -- from a slow-low projectil in movement.
And what about a bit of stilling with something stills?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like when you put a sign of a technique.
I looked like this, as if it was a photo matter, the natural, the model, but of course, but of course, but of course, our eye.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the lights are lighting the tomate, that's not going to stay. It's not going to stay.
Why is that? Because the tomate is retail is, and the lights, and after some of the seconds.
So in the future when this future when this femto-Camera in your camera in your camera, it could be able to make it possible, and figure out if a supermarket, and they're talking about whether a fruit.
So how did my teamera, I built this camera?
So when you know, as a photograph, you know, you're a photographically light, but we've got a billion light, but we're a billion times faster than your career than your care, so well, so well, so well, so well.
So we're doing this project, we send this project, this photon, this photon, and we'll record it again and then repeated synchronization and we're going to combinate these female computer scale, we've been to show you.
And we can take all of these rows and make things that are doing things.
So, superman can fly.
Other hands can make us available, but how would it be a new superherocraft for a future for a future: to see edge edge?
The idea is that we're going to street after the door.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it, a part of it, and then reflection, and then we could reflect this more simplications of lights, and we could use these more simples of light.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built it.
Links on the left of our femto camera.
Here's a puppet is a puppet, and we're going to be able to reflect the door.
After our after our at the Nature of Nature Communication" was published by nature.communication, and they've been able to do this animation.
We're going to take these lights, and they're going to be able to get to this photon, and then they're going to be able to get to the photones, and some of the photones that are going to get the lights, and then the light, and then the light, and then the lights.
And because we have a camera that's so fast is -- our fasters, we have some single camera.
It has a very good time, and she can look at the world in light, and it can look at the world.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what we don't know what we don't know what's heard.
Indeed, we can see a laser on the screen, we can see a row that -- how do we see it on the screen, but if we look at the screen, but if we look at the images of these images, and trying together and try together and try together and try together, and try together, and try toget
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got some of the lab, we can use the lab, we can use the practice, we can use the collisions, and we can see what we can see, and we can see what's going to see in dangerous, or we can look for survive.
But of course, because of course, of course, it's very, very natural, so that's why is really a way of scientist, now, now, now, now, because a new picture of medical processes, because a new picture of medical processing medical processing medical medical medical process.
So, as well as a color of the fact that we can do is a scientist, and we can't be a art, a art of the ultra-scape, and I realized that all of these gigabytes that we're not only knowing all of these gigabytes, not only knowledge.
But it's happening here,
If you look at these waves under the rivers, you see that the waves of us, you can see that the waves of us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we've almost in light, because we've almost in light, we've seen this image, and one of the image of this image.
The rest of the reference in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the camera in the camera, so we can relate the camera by space and time, we can correct this conservation of space and time.
So, even if we could use for photography, or the create of a new payment, and we're going to be able to requires, we've been able to requires, we've all data and data and datails on our website and hope to our website and hope to opened to be ab
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of opportunities, how our middle of our lives.
We don't meet every neighbors on the street, so that many wisdoms are not going to use the same public places.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like tasks and cross, slightly.
The projects of my questions, how much mine my questions, how much mine my neighbors?
How can we teach more things, without us to stop us?
How can we leave our memories to share our memories and the landscapes better?
And how can we share our homes for the houses of houses, so that our communities and dreams and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea is going to be a huge amount of since that has been hundreds of years, hundreds of years, beds and dreams, and I'm trusting to talk about a city where there's always music.
I think every time, every time, every time, no one time, there's no one parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the world, most reason in America.
I'm going to be able to do this house, and I've been able to do it.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved to be very loved.
You're Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, and she was suddenly and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death, and I felt a big thankfulness for my life, and it took me about the things that are important to me.
But it's hard to me, this point, this point,
It's easy to lose in the Alltaging and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends of the line of the line of the line, and I wrote a great tafel and wrote a sentence: "Bevor, I want to die." Everyone who I want to be a piece of piece,"
I wasn't sure what I could experiment in the experiment, but I've been filled in the next day, and they're always wall.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the walls that were written by the wall.
"Be before I'd like to die, I want to be piracy."
"Be before I'm going to die, I want to stand up the International datums."
"Be before I'd like to sing for millions of people."
"Be before I'd like to die, I want to plant a tree."
"Be before I'd like to live, I want to live."
"Be before I'd like to keeeeep them in my arms."
"Be before I'd like to be someone who I want to be someone."
"Be before I'd like to be myself."
This is after place that was a sense of place, and the hopeful place, and the hope of people, and the dreams of people, and driving me to the wine and driving me as the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and for a new and for a new and in a new way.
It's about to make place for meaning and remembers and remember what we're most important, and what we're the most important and change us.
I've done this last year, and I've been able to get hundreds of people who wanted to build a walls, and I wanted to build a walls and I've been building a based on the world, and now, now, and now, South Africa, South Africa, South Africa, South
We showed how much power our power our public places, if we have the opportunity to share our voices.
Two of the most valuable things we have, and the relationships, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever looking at the right blend things with the right blending blending and think that the life is that life is that life is that life is.
We're often being able to think about death to think about death or even thinking about it, but I've been explored, but I've been approaching us on the death is one of the things that we are strong.
The idea of the idea of death, the death.
Our common sentences of the best places that we are as individuals and as a community and as a communities, and with more possibilities, and stories, and stories, and help us to help us create us to help us better places.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm approached me with a mathematics. A particular problem for everyone who are concerned with a mathematics is that we're like companies.
Nobody knows what we're actually doing.
So I'm going to tell you the trials to explain what I do.
Tanzee is one of the most human activities.
We're introduced by most of most of most of the ballett and soups and same soups, like you're seeing.
At the ballettle of a ballettle of capability and ability and ability and abilities, and possible events that could have a genetic component.
Traurs are destroying neurological destructions like parkinson long, and that makes them too, and that makes them to my recognized Jan Stripling, who was a ballettuose.
Over the years, you've made a lot of progression in the treatment.
But yet, there's a worldwide 6.3 million people who are living in this disease, and they have to be able to live with the unrequent symptoms like symptoms, severalth and otherwise that disease, and more we need to use the middle of the disease.
We have to measure the progressive message, and we can measure, and finally, really, really, if we have a cure if we have a objective measure that this question can answer that this question.
<unk>romy is that there's not a parkinson and other movements don't have biomarker, so you can't just do any simple blood valyse. The best thing that's this 20 minutes.
You have to do it in clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very expensive studies, and that's never made it never happens.
But what if patient if patients could make this testing?
That would be a hospital tour in the hospital. What if patients could make this test itself?
It wouldn't be a teures of hospersonal hospersonal.
It costs 300 percent, 300 percent, in neurological action.
So I want to tell you a unconventional method, and I'm going to try to do that, because we're all trying to do that, because we're all of my recognition, virtuoes like my repling.
Here you see a video of video of video of video.
This is what happens in healthy when someone speakers are convinced as a stimular ballettle ballettledge because we have to coordinate all of these voices, and we have to coordinate all the genes, and we all have to do.
And as Ballets it's enormously a lot of transformation.
Think about how long a child, as long as a child.
And by the loud of the vibrate vibrate vibrate vibrate vibrate, and as the morganization of parkinson.
On the bottom of the bottom of unregular voices of unregular voices.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
If you're awak, sweak, sea.
The language will even affordable and goes to the time, and that's an example, and that's a symptoms.
These impacts on the voice, sometimes, sometimes, but with digital microphone and presence of digital microphone, combined with new systems, combined with new machines, and we can now be very excited with new machines, we can now be very far, very far, very farming.
How can this tests with clinical messages? Well, they're not both of them are both testing neurologists.
And the same thing. The infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exact. There's not going to be the voice is not by experts.
So you can be taken by itself.
They're very quickly, three times away.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something that's a brilliant, you can also use it in great scale.
This is amazing goals with this.
We can reduce logistic systems for patients.
Patients don't have to leaders in clinics in clinics.
We can't see if we can get through highly objective data.
We can do a couple of massive massive studies, and we can get a studies and first of all the population of the whole population of the whole population.
We now have the opportunity to look for Biomarkers for biomarkers for the disease.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we start to do isson's simming.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of voices to voices to voices to provide enough expendent enough exploiting of these goals.
We have spaces that are the dreiving of a billion people on this planet,
Everyone, or without parkinson, can be a little bit of parkins to go to a few center for a few center. I'll give you after we've been known for six percent of our goal.
Thank you.
If you're saying 10,000 people say 10,000 people are saying who is, who say, who isn't it?
What are you going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patient is that the patient's patients, whether these parkinson't sorry. OK.
Some of them may not be able to create it.
But we collect a huge database, under a huge database, which is really important. These environment, because we are important, because we're really important to figure out what the real marker for parkins.
At the time, you're 86 percent of the same?
It's much better.
My students, I have to love him -- I have to love it because he's so fantastic worked on the mobile physical works, that it's also working on the mobile physical works, and we're in 9 percent of the project.
This is what I call a conservation.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handy on the handy, and people could do with parkinson, and people could take their voice, so that their voice, so that you can take the progress of the progress of the disease.
That's exactly what we're doing.
Thank you. Max Life, my dades and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenya, I live in Kenyairobi nairobi national parks.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the cower of the Nairobi national park.
The Nairobi national park is just in the south is just imagine. It means that wildlife is that wildlife, like celebras the park.
The predators that are the solutions, they're going to do this. And then they do this.
They kill killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that were killed. I was killed. I was great. It was horrible. It was horrible. It was our only bull.
My stamm that the stamm of the massai, believe that we came together with our animals and the way we got together. That's why our animals.
I learned to hate solution.
Our warrior warriorans. They're protect our stamm and our hearts. They're also given our hearts.
and kill the solutions.
Here's one of six solutions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a lot of national parks in the National Park is just so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so
In my stamm is a boy between six and nine years of his father, and nine years, so it was also a box.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fewers. Lions. Lions for me.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to see the solution, but the cows, the cows.
But I didn't go. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to try to a bird.
I wanted to think that the solution, I thought I was standing up the cow.
But solutions are very clues.
They come to see the birds and go back. At the next time, but they go back, they're not moving, and saying, yes, that's still not, that's still here.
And they're taking and killing our viety.
One night, I thought I was a case. I love with a carry and this time around the hand, and this time, and that's not.
So solutions for light, which is moving.
I had an idea.
And I was working as small boy, I was working all day in my room and took my room and took my room, and I took my mother. At the day, but I had a lot about electronics.
I took an old car, and I'm going to show a direction of a motorcycle. The right or left. He's right or left. He's blink.
And I was a switch of a switch to switch the lights.
This is a little bit of a bit of a capshottlamp.
And then I built everything.
The solar panels the battery, the battery, the battery, I call it the right. I call it a transformator.
And the right thing is blinking.
You see that the birth to show you that the bulbs, because of the solution.
And this is what it looks like this, if they come to the solution.
The lights are blinking and the solution, I think about the stall.
Thank you.
I've been installed installed, and we had no problems, we had no problems.
And then we heard our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals, and she asked me if I could ask her lights, I could install them.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed. They can see the lights. They can see the solution.
And I've been doing seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good.
My idea is now used to be used to be used to other predators like hyes like hyes or leopards or leopards, elephants, elephants of farms.
My invention, I'm invention to a stip of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really excited.
My new school, my new school, and helps and helps and helping them and recording.
I even brought my friends with my friends and common installing the lights where there's no lights, and I'm showing people, and I'm going to use them.
A year ago, I just a boy from the Savanne, who was a boy. I saw afterwards me, and I'll look at me and said, "I'm going to sit in a sit."
And here I'm standing now.
I thought to airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a big, I want to be airplane and pilot. That's my great dream.
I've got solution, I can go through my invention, but by my invention, I can save the cows and the solution, and we can live in common, side, side without the solution, without strangers without strangers.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language means that.
You know, you know, it's not how to hear a story like your story as your story like your story.
So you've got this stip of this stip. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list of the list?
My next invention, now I'm working on a electric funny electric caune?
Yes, I know, electric cities are already have been invented, but I want to be my own.
You've been trying to do it, not trying to kep -- yes, I've been trying to give the trial, but I was a sleep.
All the beginning is hard. Richard Turere, you're a little bit of particularly special.
We're going to be in every step in your ways, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And I'm old enough to hold a camera in the hand, is photography. But today, but today, I'm going to share with you, and I'm not done.
There was no style of Director, no style, no chance, no chance, no chance. Not even a picture.
In fact, mostly, most of them were to be intriguous tourists.
My story begins when I started a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, and my daughter on my first birthday, and we were on my arm. We were on my arm.
And so we were a year later, we were in New York and we decided to shoot the same picture.
Well, you can see what you can see what it's going on.
When the third birthday, my daughters, my wife, "Hey, why don't you sabina, and it doesn't make it a father-daughter reclual for the ritual for the ritual fort?"
And then we started to ask forwards, we asked tourists, a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal, as universal free of their camera,
No one has ever said, no one has ever been doing, and fortunate with our camera with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rice, how much these rice.
This journey is very holy.
This is only after the 11. September 11. September 11. And I had to understand what happened on the day.
These images are much more than just a moment, or a moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way to make a way to keeeep the october that time and how we're going to change our time, not only physical, not only physical, not only physical, but in all of us.
Because even though we're always changing our perspective of Mal. While they're always seeing new miles, and as they see the life with their eyes, and how they see it with all the way they see it with all around them.
These very intensive time that we spend together with each year, and every year we're expecting every year.
Last, as one of our rice, we went on a rice, we started to fly, and suddenly, and then she's like a red last market, she shows up a puppet of a puppets, in early a puppet.
And she told me about her feelings that she had as a five-year-old on the same thing.
She said that she remembers like her heart from the breast, when she saw the breast time she saw the first time she saw the first time.
And now she looks like in New York, because they want to study because they want to study in New York.
And I realized that was created: The most important thing we all create, are memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you, an active role in the most important memory of memory.
I don't know how it looks like it, but I'm going to look like this 15 pictures, I'm on a family photo.
