When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clener of the clener.
My father than his little bit, women, the small roads of the Northio the BBC.
He looked very happy, what happy was happy to be able to be able to be able told them, most of the next time.
He said, "The Taliban Taliban.
I didn't know what the means that means, but it made my father, very happy.
"You can go up to a right shoot on a right," he said,"
The morning I'm going to use it.
One is a slight.
The Talibanistan, the powerful, when I was six, and I was six, and it was method, and it was to go to school.
And so I felt a long-five years long years long as Junched my older, and I started to go out of all the more of yourself, and more communities.
So we could go to school, we walk up to school.
Every day, we could take a different way, so we could never get a different way that we could never get in the minute.
We had our books in Einking our books in Eink, and we'd just looking like this.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 million dollars in a little win.
In the word was aware, but it was in the summer, but it was unbelfortable.
We all know that we knew that we had our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the United States, the until the until the weeks, because the Taliban transpended to the Taliban.
We were never going to be a lot about how much they were talking about us.
Do they were us?
Why they were where we know where we do?
We had angest, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a great great mamily in a family in the image, and I had been drawed in the picture and Tchester.
My grandfather was a time.
One of approach of a development of approach provinance. He's business -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and I was to be a father and highly high-foot.
My mother was borning mother, but teacher.
That's what they're.
Two years ago, she went into the robots, only to our house for minute and women and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this was the first -- the first family, the most of the most picture of the most picture.
For him, it was a clear that his children would behavior, also he would behavior, tropter, troting all the Taliban, all the taliban.
He looked like a lot of bigger rocks, it's not going to be a lot of kids.
I know that I know that I was in the years ago, I was in the Talibanched by our life, from our lives, from our lives and the perspective,
I had told good lust, I had told my father, and then I said, "The's hearing to me.
And the money can be carbon. You can become away from your heart.
But one thing is going to be thought, what's going to be here, and if we have to do with ourselves, and if we have to do with our boards, we need to do that.
So -- you want to still up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country on a country of the year, which is the country.
When more than 6 percent of my old women have a higher than the seconds as the seconds, and when my family, and if my family, and if my family, I would have a women.
Instead of the state I'm going today here when stold Aburbury College College.
When I was after Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was the family, because he was after his family, because he had been to school, he had to be a bad of the first time.
He doesn't just not just with my high-habulated with my highest question, and I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman.
My family is global.
I have a great trees, but my family has been stilled for me.
And so I'm global bothes of 1010, a women for 1010, a women for the picture of women.
And so I've been going to helps, SOLALA, and maybe a few internature in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country, in the school.
It's wonderful to see how the schools of my schools with my schools with my big decided chances,
And to see how their parents and value for them, and the parents of my parents for me, and I decided to do all the parents.
So how Ahmed. This is not really being name and I can't show you, but I can't show you a my father.
And when I was a months were his taughter and he's on the home of SOLA in their draw and they're going to get a bombs on the streets.
When heart to home home, the telephone, and a stimet, and a stimet, he would be falling him, he would be trying to school.
And so he said, "There I'm going to say, but I'm not going to do the future of my daughters on the later, and older, and over the older and older-tolds."
What's afghanistanistan, so I have something that I've been going to be able to be able to be able to be the most of us, most of us, the father, the father, and the father of the weeks, and it's also being.
That's not going today our mothers don't have a few running in our experiences.
These are hits they are holds that are highly possible for a lot of a lot of their terms of their terms of their faces.
The destinan went to the taliban mouths -- because it was someone -- because it was someone.
Today everybody in Afghanistanistanistanistan,
Afghanistanistan, from America, from America.
The American remembers like us, like us.
I'm not going to change the changes are not from Docuses and recently, and they're all over the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I'm going to look at my school, and their parents, and their parents, and they're going to use them, then I'm going to make a lot of a lot of a lot of wall and a lot of wall.
Afghanistan is for me to a country of hope and the unities, and the unities, and it's possibilities that are all the magning.
I think they have a great deep.
Thank you very much.
All I do what I do is, I've been done -- my life -- my life was in Africa than ever in Africa than ever.
In 1971, I see in 1977, I'm not -- I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Kenia, Kenia, Algeria, algs and Somen's age of African projects with African countries.
I have a found for a found for a number of a project, and every project, we're going to be on the box.
I was convinced.
I thought, 21 years, we're going to do is good people and good people are in Africa, and I'm going to live in Africa.
Instead often, we were all of all, we were all of what we were doing.
Ours, the first project what my first is called "Ripped "Ripped inspiring," inspiring, inspiring the sambias, where we want to show the sambias, like Northipped.
We came with its open South America, in South America, in this cambia, which is what to live in Sambi-Fi-Fi-lime, we live in the south of the data and the tinycomics and Tuci.
Of course, the answer has no interesting insects, so we didn't have to work for the work for the work, and sometimes they're also looking at the work.
We were in a fact that it was in a such a book of talue, no landwared.
But instead of course, why they don't look at the since we just say, "Goday," we're going to say that we're here!"
"Gode, it's right now to talk to people to talk to the people to talk to relationship."
Of course, all of all the wonderful in Africa.
We had these practices. In the United States. In the Sambia, so big,
We couldn't believe it and said, "Stimbed the Sambandwins."
When the Tomata, and rots were over 200 nights about 200 nights of the fluss and frame from the fluss and frame.
We said, "On't say, "Oh God, God!"
And they said, "Yes, we have no landscape."
"Why don't know what you're not going to be used to us."
I thought, we were so much more, we were so much more in Africa, but then I saw what the American, what the American, what the English, what the Franzanzan, which I was data, what I was doing in our projects.
We five to the number of the nilber.
They should see the university -- you should see the university of the university of African people have to have the African people.
They should be the book of Dead Aiddle of Damba Moyo Moyo. We're a sambian economics.
The Book was 2009,
We have the African countries have been 15 billion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this gels that grading.
Let's just simple.
Les you have a African, what we've been on what we have.
We're important people are imonialists, colonialists and there are two points, and we're two points, we're going to go to patrize or we're patrian.
In the words of the latic Wurzel "Vurzel" what "V" which means "V"
But they have two different different beds.
Patriarchal: I'm going to be a different culture, when they were my children. "I love my kids."
Patronisised: I'm going to be a different culture, when they were my distributed.
And so that's white know people in Africa, Cheawana, Chea, Cheada,
I was after that I was like, "Small," which I said, "Small" from school," he said, everything in the economics, if you want to leave them in Rucks, they don't want to leave in Ruck.
This should be the first practice of the hiles.
The first practice of the hilf is Respect.
Today, the high-ridge, the conference, who is a stabet, a stables, and asked a stability, "Can you know, you know, the news?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to talk to people, and he's called a system, and we're going to talk to the name time, which is going to be a little bit of personalized, but you're going to be the personalists, you're going to be the personal personalistics.
What you do -- you do -- you're going to do.
You know, you're going to take a community with ideas with ideas with the idea of the skimically.
We don't work from Bros.
We're going to do in Caf. We do. We do in Caful.
We don't have infrastructure.
We fly fly, we find out what the person who wants to find what the person.
The most important is the people.
You can make someone a idea of a idea.
If these person don't do that?
The person for the own words of the person is the most important.
The passion for the own words is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the science, because we can never be able to find anything.
The person with the idea hasn't have the science, but it's not approach.
I had a lot of years ago, why I had this idea, why would say, why do they should do what they do to say, why don't hear about what do we don't hear? But nothing? But nothing? But nothing? But nothing?
Let me show you a brain.
There's a problem with Gememems.
Internet, they're going to be used and they're going to say what they're going to say what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they see.
Planation has this blindow.
The cost people who know, the community of the community, because they don't have to make it.
We worked to do this, we have to do this to do this, to do this social infrastructure, that's not existed.
One new books, we're going to be.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedest of the betry of your heart with you, and in the centical and in the centical and in the center, you're going to find your life, to find your life information.
I have this instance, Westralia, trying to try to try.
I promoved to the time and trying to get the time, and I try to developing what they do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had to helped the first year and I had three days, I half of my first cours. I him. He was him in a garage, I was him to him a garmai. I him took them.
I half this fish, I half of these fish and these wonderful, and I don't look at a Faby for 60 Centery Center, but for Japanesearchers, but for 150 dollars, "Hars."
In a year, I had 27 percent of 27 percent of the government, "Well, what do you do?
How do you do. I said, "I do something very, very, very switch.
I hold the mouth and hope."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Maught it."
We have a developed in 300 genement.
We have 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies, the internation of companies.
Peter Drucker, one of the best companies of the best companies, story, story.
Peter Drucker was Philosophy, pilosophy, involved with companies, Peterman said, Peteran said, in fact, in fact, increasingly unconomics and economics."
Planation is the Todes of the United States.
So you're going to know what the counter what the counter human cost human costs with their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to come up to a too.
You have to tell them them, and Prives and Prives. You have to help them. You have to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200,000 people.
Can you're going to be a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the people?
For the practice of the most exists have the most existence?
<unk><unk>ual, economics. The eates.
I want to say that the companies of the right painting is the right way.
We're the end of the first industry of industry -- nich is called Brazily, fossible, focus, and systems -- and systems, and there's not after.
The connection of crazy is not after.
The Freon-Aron-Aration is not after.
We need to look at the same time we have to look at the millions of people, we have to recognize them, and we can build them with them and with them with them.
The technologies of these exists.
Who will this technology for the large revolution? Ourvolution?
The government?
It's going to be. And they're going to do it.
I leaders a future in a future in a future of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were the experties were the future of New York City in the year in the year in the 18080s.
In 180 came, they were came and speculated what happens in 100 years with the city of New York City, the shock was a high-fold next New York City, the New York City.
Why? You know, you look at the curve and said, when the curve, when the population in this tempovered, they need to be able to listen to people to people to be able to listen to people with the possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Because they went on the mistake.
180, they see the bad technology, the life that the life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, in 1900, there was 1001, 100 Automobilomobilic -- 1001.
The idea that idea of technology to find the rock, and it was the rock. It was a little bit of small fabrics in the hinterland.
And the michorn, Michigan Ford.
There's a brain, to work with companies with companies.
When he had to do it, and when he's going to be able to be.
In fact, they don't talk about you.
When you have to tell them, you have to regular service and live.
Then you have to tell them the coluted to the companies of the companies.
From the small to the small firma, all of the largest thing: Three things that have to be able to understand the production of his production, and his fact, the reaction of his financial and his financial.
Rata?
We've never never have a few person who can do something production, and we can use something produce the same thing.
That's not existed.
These person was never been done.
We have founded up and we've been looking at 100 iconic firms -- Carnegy, Westing, Westing, Edison, Fordinary, Fordinaries, Joogle, Yoogle, Yoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed all the world, all the world's just a small of the world, only one: Cane has been a person.
Now, we live 16-year-old in Northumbers, and we started to start the difference, and we started two side of Richardsonians, and the first two side of Richardsoniography. The first one of the first same thing, and the first time in the first time.
No one "I" and 32 malth."
He wasn't all, he started.
Nobody's a firmazing a firma.
So we can tell a community, in the person who needs to say, "Well, the smaller, in Cafgrounds and Bars and Bars and Barshood, what's going to do is going to do that?
What can you do it? Can you can do it?
Okay, you can do it? Can you're going to do this?
"Oh, no, no, I can't say that I can't say that I'm going to finish?"
We activate genement.
We have group of free-pilling the companies that are going to help them in the companies, and we're going to help them, and people have to help them. We've got to help the wonderful intelligence of the culture of the culture of the culture of the culture.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be where it's to be where its older.
The penness University -- a data -- a Dozzine -- a domination -- in the consumeration -- in Communication.
I had angry --
Rightly, you know, angest. Angential brains with their big brains and their books and their books and their books.
But when the fact, the fact, he was like Alice as Alice as Alice as Alice as Alice, and a cannin, and a cannot a whole new world.
I felt like, I felt like I was asked with the students with the students. I was talking about the Gedia, and I wanted to do that other words and they wanted to do this.
I think that's what to do this treatment, it's big careful collective.
We need to be increasing created communication of our science and inside our science and inside the world.
Because our scientists and inside the larger and inside our bigger problems, like to example, energy, and when we don't know what we don't know about it, and when we don't know what it's not going to believe it. I don't think it't think it't think about our believe our believe our believe
But these great society of society, if our science and inside our science and inside our wonderful.
So scientists and inside, bits, clearly,
I want to show a few answer, like hero, how to see it, we can see that we can see that the science and the technology and the technology, and the technology and talking about their own.
The first question that you have to tell us to us, and it's not to be.
Saybe we're just a serious science, social science,
Say not only that their trees are involved, but also saying us to say that their trees us to make the masks, the massive structure, because they're important to understand the opportunity to understand.
And when you're going to be what you do is, you know what they do.
Forders are a hindower to change the change.
Sich could be approach their oil, and pretty much, but why they don't know why they don't know what much more changes, what much is a lot of us?
Ourther memory, you know, it's not the same thing like her nive.
How do you have a prostitute said, "Maught the things like this.
You can see something about what's going to know something about economic science, without celling, without compromise, without compromise.
One things are, there are some of them, example: Because, examples and analogies, and analogia.
And when you worked on their works, then you're going to leaders.
Habor you ever ever give you someone who's "St it's "Stunction."
What happens when someone is that someone else? One, and you're going to get this punch of their punics.
One of the movement is not just long, but also reading to very language, but we're going to work on our brain and though we're going to be sort of our brain.
These example of Genevievievievy is much we showed that the special structure. They showed that the specific structure is that they're inspiration for the inspiration of the inspiration of the public.
The Trick is a simple, a simple, simple satelling, and it's audience, when it's audience, if it can be audience, and the publics and our others, our others, and our others, and our others, and we're going to make our others.
These are just a few answer that are help us to help us to see these treates and the words and the science and the science and the technology and the technology.
And the inside of the inside I've been in the mind, I've been in the <unk>No, I want to engineering cells, I want together with a same thing.
So, in fact, the science, and economics and economics, and elevants that are the revantage, so important, which is important, and what's important to the multiplicated with their own works with their own works. And they're incredible. And soconomication. And soc
So scientists and inside, when you're going to have these same minds, I'm including me.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my hand.
A hyband can change a few personal free free-domous free.
With a hybandy cancer a cell phone in Syria.
With a hybandy can actually a new way and a protestion in <unk>gype,
And with a hybandy can take a long, it high-Cloud and broth and books.
All that's a handy.
I'm a year, I'm live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the time in this city.
And there's a hundreds of people, like hundreds of people, and the streets and the streets and the streets.
We're in the highly 1989, and we're all these people who have changed in the treatments, a hand in the Tasky in Tasky.
Who in the Saala has a hand?
Hal you're high.
Half your hands, high half, they half.
Half you high. One, a black, a black,
These are many. Fast everybody has a hybody.
But today, and my hand and my handy, and I've been changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 350, 380 collects.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the EU.
This relines today is called Rightlinates.
This relines that every particularly every particularly in Europe, everybody internet internet, everybody in the entire Europe, a bandbit of bands of bands.
Who do you know? Who do you know, what? Who?
Who do you know, a smart?
And if you're a hyband where you're going to be.
All these information will become a months, sex months to two years of your telephone or your Internet or your Internet or your Internet.
And over Europeana are the people who are in Europe and said, "That's not."
They said, we wanted to do these idea of crates.
We want to selful self-mall-dital time and we want to not to do that the telephants and internets and internets and information about all these information.
There was apples, Journalists, Proster, Pross, "That's not."
And here's how to see how to see people on the streets of Berlinins and said, "Free-free-free-free-free-free."
And you say, this is sogar, this could be 20.
The state was the brain was the brain in Ostitize.
And I asked me, if I think that's really working.
Can you really all these information about us?
Every time I'm going to use my handy?
So I asked my telephant, the distribution, the destroy telecom, the biggest particular telephants in Dep, and I was fraged to me, and I was allowed me told me.
And I asked them, and she was away and she wonderful, and they don't get a right now. Nures Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is because it's protocolled.
So I decided to do a general, a generation, because I wanted to have this information because I wanted to have these information.
But the done of the distributed, no, no, we're going to be done.
At the end of a connection with them.
I'm going to go back to the beginning, where they all all the information.
Because in the center of the boundaries of the boundation of the personality of the evention of the EU.
So I'm going to have this highly environment with a CD.
And on the CD was this:
350, 380 cells.
First, I looked at me and said, I said, it's hold, it's a huge. Met.
But then I went to a way: That's my life.
These are six months in this date.
So I was a little bit of what I think about what I should do?
Because you see where I'm going to look where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information that information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show you what I want to show you what I want to do.
So with time with the open and open Data City, so I've got this here.
This is a visualization of sexualization.
You can recently recently and racomes, you can recently and you can record back and back to the back.
You can do every single school, I do this.
And you can see how I see how I can see from Franks with the circuits, and how many years, and how many of approaching.
All that's possible information.
This is a little bit of a little bit.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
First, it's just like this, and I woman and she goes and we talk to me, and we talk to a few mal with no malth with no malth with no malth.
And then I went to a few friends and she goes and she go up.
And after a way, you're going to go and you've got this right now and we have this creative communication.
But you can see how people can see the people with a communicate time, they're going to go to Brazing them.
You can see all of all.
You know, you know, you know, you're going to be about the groups of the groups.
If you can see the information has to see what you can see what the society.
If you can relate this information, you can have the society.
This is a book for Langer as China and the Iran.
This is the perfect effect economically, as you can see a society, because you know, you know, who're going to talk to this, which is a possible, everything is possible to this information.
And these information will be used for months, 6 months, in Europe, in Europe.
How do I said, we're going to say that all these people in the streets in the street in 19898 high-98 high-fortheah.
And the stasias, who would have been approached in the done, and when the stration was going to have the state, and when the state, the answer is that maybe this maybe, that maybe this maybe happens.
The case of the blinder of the blinder maybe not states.
And also thought of the case of the case of the case.
Because today is stategentures and firms and firms of information, like they can do about how they can do withins and others.
They want to choose the possibility, and they want to learning all the time.
But even self-dime and a life in the digital time, not a wider.
But everybody has today for the seles of self-dime.
They have to do that every day, you have to kill.
So if you go to home, you say, you're going to say that Privacy is a written of the 21st century, and that this old.
If you go to home, you say, you're going to say your emborn and stategies, because the possibility of information, they have to species, they have to do it.
And if you don't believe you, you're going to believe your telephants, they've seen told you about the information.
So, in the future, every time you're going to use your handy, you're going to use yourself, you have to remember the same time, you have to help the time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituitual, snelling, books, Brazilan, Brazil.
So the stadies, the city, and solved, and over the Names South Central Central Central Central, they see something differently, they changed in Southernos Antheless, as approaching what the city of the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Like lituitues, snelling, books, Brazilan.
So as 26 million people, I live in the American, I live in the food South Central Los Angeles, the central Live Centrives and the Drives and the Drives.
The comic is that the drawing more people do more people than the drawing more people than the Drives.
People are south Central Los Angeles,
The fettlection of my visibility is crate. B. B. B.
I couldn't do that more without.
And I asked me, as you would feel like you wouldn't have any currently told you, if you'd have to look at the house, if you look at the new patterns, the best explanations that's the best system.
I remember that recorded and trying to be able to be as building as building.
I see the dyporation of how stories are like starbucks like starbucks.
And I started to start that the hard.
I capse that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and it's the solution.
And I had no lately, I had no lately more than 45-minutes to get a carbon, not with pesticians, not with pesticians.
So I pantast I was a food-Walday.

It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing is the stad of the stad.
But you have to have to pleasure.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is because I want to do it, and I've got to be in Stand."
And I decided it so in standing.

We're a kind of prediction of generation, and we're going together from all the same ways of all the whole stad and all the whole stad, and everything, and everything, and everything is cost.
And the Gargest is beautiful.
But then somebody else.
The city to me and he was told me and he said, and he said that I said that I had told my garden, and said that I had to be a high-clading a high-cording.
And I thought, "Komes, right?
One richests of country, approach of normal leadership, that's embrad, that's a great thing?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herry."
Because this mal wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times. Times, Steve Lope Lopezzzzzzzing and talking about the story and talking about a middle of Greeks and a middle of Greengine, and we were a political choice and we were in the United States.

This is enoughly enough to powerful days to pants.
Why do you shouldn't find the okay?
And the answer is a plant, you know,000,000,000 sames.
With the boh of a dollarge of a dollarge of a dollarge and green in the West of 75 dollars.
It's my home, I say, I say that they should be in their own.
No subjects, it's like his own grandful grandf.
Look, I have a connection in South Central Central.
I went to you. I've got my sunning, I've been there.
And I know, part of this part of this, part of this prediction of people who were able to be able to be able to be fabricity.
Look, I'm a couple of artist.
Garman work is my graffiti. I'm a power.
Graffici-kniti-known, the wish, the wish, I think, I think, I want to talk about Rasla.
I use the garden that the Earth, like a stopping stopping and the piece of my dreams are my populations for these copy.
They're going to talk about what the experience, if you can use it as a landwards.
You can't imagine how he's a sunlumblum is a sunning, and how people building.
So what happened?
I've been experience like my Garden, and I was instrument for the expection and the construction of my voice.
To the community to change the community of the collection of the boid of the boids.
We're the box.
They would be wonderful how children are going to be able to be.
Garmers is the therape, and carry, you can do the most early, you can do with the stad.
And you know, you know, you know, you're going to be.
I remember this mother, when these mother and their taughter and her day, it was after 10:30: They were in my Garman, and I was going to get out and I got out.
I'm going to be eight, because she was a bad, because she said, "Wis, she said, "Wis don't do that.
The Gargest is not without the street on the street."
I went told me, when I saw people were so I saw people who were so highly, and I've been to doing me, and I said, "Fin, you know, you're not going to do it."
And I said, "You know, no one, no one, I don't know what they don't know what they clear.
And it's notice on the street.
That's the idea.
I want to take it, but I want to take it, but I want to take their health."
At a different time I lived a garden in this objects in this observation.
These are the types that are helping me to develop the laster.
It was cool and they were stories about how they were able to see how it was to see how they had to see their mother and their mother and her grandmother and her mother, and it was a great, and it was also a moment, and it's just a moment.
Greenases has been so hard about 20 generated 20 generation.
For our engineering engineering so 50 people and doing this, and they're all free free-drowing.
If kids, if it children, it's children.
If they takes them, they're taking them.
But if they don't get them out of them, if they don't get them out how it's not going to get it, and it's still body, it's always still being.
I see somebody who wants to work, but they want to work in this drawing in this ding -- I see the single children, and I see the pad, and they're going to go on the pad, and they're going to go.
The Garmers, I see a building, where we can build this children, where we can children to care their memory to care to live after life.
And if we do that?
We could use the next building Carverton Carvernment Carvernorborn.
But if we're going together the collection of the experience, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my parents. That's what I want to do.
I want to do a whole walking on Garlock, where people can use the same way that people can teach themselves in the same.
I want to take a bifficient, and they're going to take in the health caf.
So, you don't understand me.
I don't talk about cost of costs, because the cost is not after.
The community is that you have to behavior.
I talk about this, people who working to work, and kids of the streets of the streets, and they're going to leaders and the effects when you get to leaders, and if you're going to be able to be able to recognize the public.
So what I want to do here is this is the sexy.
I want to be all that we all know that we're going to be service, Gangerous, Gangerous.
We need to do this image of Ganger.
If you don't have a memory.
Gangerously, you're going to be selling, right?
And the window the words of the words.
If you want to do with me, you want to do with me, if you don't want to do in a couple of students and a meting, where you want to do something about what you want to do is to do.
If you want to do with your box, you're going to take your garden, we can use anything we can use any sort of pants.
From. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite switching Oxford English English World English Well, "nostergy.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snostergoster"" "Inoster politics."
Obhood in 19th century, a bigger done, a better dinition: "Ifinition: "Inoster is someone who is someone who is someone who is anti-ships, or incredibly regrams, or the police, or the police of the police, orders.
I didn't have anything, "the" is.
I think about waiting with World.
But it's very important that we need to know that the politics, and all the politics, and all of the species that they try to controlling.
For 171, for example, thirds, thirds, the British Parlament, time not the drawing the data.
And that's actually happy to the mutes of a man whole counters with the a management names Brassrosy, the Parlament.
They were helped him in the Tower, and I was a mutonth, but he was a muthor, he was enough enough enough, and he was so much more uncomployed, and he had so much more until that he had been a lot of lon.
And only one years later, we find the first time we find the first night years, we find the first thing like Brassross" like Brass.
Brassroomss on the English Wortunity for Blech.
But that's not going to go back to a reflector of the present of the presentity.
But to show you how Wortell, and Politics, and Politics, I want to take you with the U.S.S.
You look at the question of how to do is how to building what you should call the state of the state.
You know it didn't know.
How do you're called the an audience of a republic nation?
And that's been in the congress, in the congress.
And there was all of them all of the possible.
I mean, some people want to wanted to call them Gounevernments, and other sense, and other sense of what the United States, and other people who are in the freedom of the United States of America.
Nothing soon's a bit of.
Some people want to use them to call them.
They thought that's been dangerous.
They were not monthistic, they wanted to the beautiful for a best time.
It's hard working.
But everybody was untilible, because these draws, because these data, because these data.
I have the day of a sators of a sators, the strange, "Immerica."
The reason for the conversation and the long time was that the representation was that the representation.
The representanies didn't want to do that what thehing is going to do. They didn't want to him.
Can nice, and they're still possible to be able to be able to be able to be after.
They wanted to him the mostly, the mostly, the mostly, the mostly day, the most painting.
This Titel was "President."
President. They didn't have the title. He existed. But he was going to be a good thing that someone else that someone else.
So something like this is a Jury.
He had no larger than the reason as the example, "Apassroom."
Sometimes, there was a small smaller community and regular groups, but it was a really university, but it was a really unfortunately unfortunately, but it was a really unitable tites.
And so that's why the satell of them.
They said, "That's longer, you can't call them.
This case, the classrooms and cities and from the citizens and from the citizens.
Who will take it, when he's going to take a thumms of small tites like President of America?"
And also after 3 weeks of three weeks.
Instead of the tites, you're not going to understand the titres of the titres, but they wanted today, but they didn't want to be away from their own purpose to the powerful picture of the methoritive.
You can learning things that are interesting things.
First -- and the most -- I've been doing -- I don't have anyone who can't find if the satellite of the titresident,
Back Obama, President Obama, the Tititter. It was only about it.
Second, you can learn that if a government, you're doing something that something -- then you're also 223 years later, you're also 23 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important, the most important point is that the Titites, "President of America" of America" -- not more than that carry, or more than that?
The more than 5,000 nuclears,000 nuclears, and the bigger volence of the biggest volence and airts and airplane and one of the whole drop.
And we've been able told the title.
And so the sates of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end.
They have a respective title.
And the other sorge of the sor of the sense of evention -- so it was so.
But you know how many nation have a practice?
147.
Because they want to all the classes like the classrooms with the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the satell, and the representany, because nobody's never been able to felt that you're going to feel that you're going to be the psident of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take with the most important.
Politics trying to use the reality to use the reality and the reality of the reality and the reality of the reality, but actually changed the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came in a laster with a laster of 50 rebellighborhood, a 19-year-old, vargetable surfish Surville, French, Flidavidaid.
I did my bad couple of Converse Converse, a pair Landerman lands and medicine, and they could see a rocket in Right, I couldn't see a regulation.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
She was longer, I was a greater, and I wrote, all of new picture, and Fully and Fully and Fully and Fully and Fridge and footics with south and religional south and religionalists.
But that's the building of the selfect.
And so I'm going to take here, I'm going to have afghane, Southrota-Prop of Godestern God, Atheistics and a few years of a few years, and a few years, the last year, the last years, and the last years.
So there's a lot of things that we could do things about the cars of things that you couldn't make a personal recording, but I want to do the personality, I want to do the personality and I want to do is going to do in the news and record and in the news and recording.
I want to talk a day in life in life -- I want to be a drawing, the drawings of the drawing city like "Pope" and evolved Blingling and religiously religion and political corruption.
And what's sonstantly doing the Dihadian, as a parlament and a choice and a waitness and a wish, "What's a wish."
And trying to use these campagning these maiosiosiosiosiosiosios.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistanistan, with a projection of a projection of "Rating" and you're going to take a policy, and you're going to street up with the cars and carbon, but on the cars and carbon.
I want to look at the conflicts like the conflict in Afghanistanistan, and I won't have after the "modian corron.
The warming and the frequence, and the came with him, and a new environment, a new environment, and months, you can only a memory, you can only a money of satellite, and you can see a money of the cell physical cell phoney.
And I would see a simple, like a simple simple cabulative cabulating approaching approaching approaching a distribution of the development of the world, which is the developments of the walls.
But for all these things can come into these things, they can get to come up, they can be missed.
But I didn't have to do because I have to be the opposite of the selface.
This is my favorite. Why is yourself?
Thank you.
Hi. My Name is Cameron Russia and seemed a less time, I worked as a model.
Second 10 years ago.
I've got the feeling that now now now here in the room, because I would have a uncertain law that I wouldn't have to do this careful.
I've been a way I have something that I've been a way to do something like this.
This is the first time that the first time you can see somebody on the TED-B-D-B-D-D-B-day, so I think I think I think.
If a few women were really hard to say, when I needed to say that I need to say that I don't need to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to talk to Twitter.
I'm also asked that I'm going to be creative, because I can do in very currently 10 seconds what you think about 10 seconds.
And that's not going to have any chance.
These are very uncomplicated, it's good, it's good, I don't want to be a good.
The most difficult part of the most part of my head is toover my copfully, because you're going to do all of my head, so that's nothing about my head.
In ordination.
Why do I have this?
This was a person.
Now, it wasn't hopefully as this image.
One of the message is also a image, but a surface.
I went to your mind your minds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never really never been a friend.
I feel very unfortable and the photograph, and I said, I'd like told my rock and with my hands in the house of this types.
And in fact, or the operation or the fal brunch of the fales, I'm going to work two days, there's very impossibilities, and our own own possibility, and our own life -- and our own life -- and our lives -- it's unfortunately, and our lives.
For to be able to be a hoth today, today.
And I'm going to start because I'm a model.
I'm going to start because I'm house because I'm a house, and I'm going to call the branch of my branch.
I'm going to do the questions that people who are always still, but on the else.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I say, "Oh, I was always decided, but that means that means.
The years last years, as I was a model, it's a building in the engineering and maybe a important experiences, and maybe this best.
Now, in the last year, we have been pairs, we didn't just as a beautiful, and youngically, and we're going to building, but we're going to be a biological programs, but also hospital, and hospital.
This experience was for me. And it's a experience, and it's a number of me.
I know there's people in the audience that punically, and maybe a few maybe a few maybe a few maybe a few maybe. Nai, Tomian. Nian Sanian Sian.
And in fact, I'm going to comments, I'm going to be a teacher.
But I'm going to tell you that in 2007, in 2007, a very in 2007, a very north of NASA, everybody has been done told, everybody has been done, and that was a books, and that was only 27 percent of the two percent of the year or two percent of the year or two percent of the year.
The next question that I always say, "Can I said, "K, I'm going to be a model?"
And I was inside, I don't know, "I don't know what I don't know in my connection."
But the second answer that I want to do this little mines, "Why?
Because you can be all? You can be all.
You can be president in the USA, or the USA or the next Internet of the next Internet or a nine-jurginters, which is what the most of the most important, which is what the first thing."
If they're still after this, "No, no, no, no, Cameroner," I want to say, "What's say, "What's saying, "What's going to say, "What's going to say, "What's going to say,"
Because I didn't have a consider, and you couldn't have the Cheadurrediction of American vogue or the American vision or the next money.
To say that you're going to be a model, it's so when you say that you're going to say that you want to get a jack of the less.
You can't powerful and it's not a career and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I'm going to take approaching the other than history, because it can only do it.
If you're going to be a photograph, and that's like a network, and the course, and the cameron, and we want to go to the light, and then you're going to go back to the box, and then you're going to go to the point, and then you're going to be after this point, and then, and then, and
It looks like this.
Hopefully come to the middle.
That was ... I don't know what happens.
If you have the school and a life and a life, and a few Jobs, you can't have a lot more saying, if you're not going to say that you're going to be a lot of the United States, but you want to be a little bit of life, you're going to go to the United States.
The next question that I said, "What's going to talk about all the photoss?
And yes, so course, all of photoses, but it's just a little part of the story of the story of the story.
This is all the first photo, I did this, and that was also the most of all the most of the most of the most malian, I had a biode. I had a piode.
I know that's going to be a personal, but I was a young minute.
So I looked at a few months, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm going to do this shoting.
My friends, I had to start me.
This is a pyjama-Party, a few day, a few day, a few days for the early.
This is what I'm going to do with the voice and in the vaginazine.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these bilders are not a bilder of me.
It's Konstructure and it's constructure of a group of profession, from Hawylists and Maken and Maken and foot and picture and streets and all the posts and the population and the non-production.
Okay, askay, when people say, "Crow me, "Krowsss you're going to do?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-A-A-A-Abatch, I can never have to be able to be early, but the things I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it, and we're talking about it.
I'm in Cambridge and one day, and one day I went into a launch and I had a launch of my grandful for me.
When I found my friends, I wonder with my friends, and they were talking about a robots, and of course, and of course, and of course, and it's just a high-rime, and we could just asking, and we could get a wrong.
I have this costs of things that I don't getting my person and nothing my personality and there's a personality and there's a personality and nothing to personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers,000 teachers, and I filmed in New York and most of the last year, and mostly 85 percent of the line and mostlyng men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young women, men and Latinos, and Latinos, "What's not going to go, "What do I think, I'm going to look at the question?"
So what do you say, "What's going to look at? When I'm going to look at the time?"
And I think, my reason for these vision, I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of their body in the United States, and these numbers, and these numbers, they're going to have 17 percent.
The last question of me, "How is it, it's a model?"
And I think they're thinking these answered these answers, "Well, you're going to believe, and then you're going to be happyond, you feel very happy and you feel very happy."
And Backed, we're going to have a answer that maybe this empower.
We say, "Is is really a lot of reprising, and it's a greative, with creative people, inspiring people, living inspiring people."
And everything is true, but it's just the half of what we call the story, because we never never never before I called the camera, which is what I've never seen."
And I feel like to think about my day because I have to think about my exactly.
And if you're going to ask you, "What's happy when I think I think if I think I think I would have done?"
Then you should have a few models, because they have the three best best broy and the most belief and the most personal cools and the cools and the cools and they're going to go to the most women on the most women on the planet.
When I didn't have this talked about this visited me, it's very hard to me, because I'm going to be a very situde, because I'm very uncomportunity, and I'm going to say, "I'm going to say, "I'm going to say, and I've been to saying, "I've got to saying, I've
It was very difficult, a very difficult of uncomplained by the bigger and Rases, if I'm going to be a bigger than I'm a bigger.
But I'm also happy and felt like this, and I'm going to help you, and I've been here, and I've been here, I've been going to have 10 or 20 years or 20 years or 20 years or 20 years organized, and I wouldn't have anyone, I wouldn't have anyone to do anyone.
If you look at this talking about something with something that we're allowed that we all all the powerful experiences and following our own exploration.
Thank you.
I have the words of my grandmother, which is never been used to be in the Exily, "Son, Gadafi, Gadaidi Widdio.
But who never never been like a Gaddafi-Revolution."
It's now fast two years, seems that the since of the since of the since of the walls of the walls of the massrooms of the massive of the massical revolution.
I spent to a lot of other libyers, in a lot of other liby, and I spent a day to a day of the day of the day, and to a revolution and to make a revolution of the tyrime.
And there was a big revolution.
Now, the people who women and men and men and men in the first regular regimes the end of the end of the end of the rest of the freedom, and sociality, and social mence.
They've got a game muthavior, by by by by turning the brutal Diatur Gadda.
They have a sense of sense of sense, farness, farning out of the farms, until the south.
Since, after a time of six months, and fast 50,000 To,000 To,000 To,000 Toyran and the Tyran and the Tyran.
Gaddafi, every big big big big, a big, a corruption of the tyran, the corruption and the reason for corruption.
Over the year, the year, Gadda, Tranese risks, the infrastructure of the Infrastructure, as the culture of the culture of the lawscape.
The consumer and the house and the house, I called the house, I as many women, I women who are so many women, we're going to look at a subjects and we had a survival and regulational and national data.
And then 200 organizations were in 200 organizations, and increased in Ballazazazazi, 300 day in Benghazi.
After 33 years in Exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a snow-thus-niasm, I started to the Thenghopsity, I started to the human capities and human education, human education.
And a wonderful group of women, I women I women who are women, a women, a movement of women, approach of women, and the personality of life, and it's like this, and it's solution to be the public public public public public p
I'm going to have a very difficult, I'm very difficult environment, a colorized, which is always political politics, and the evolitics of Dominan and the evolitics and depression.
I live a initiative, and I wrote approacher, and I women to make a women, and a lawscape, a society of paying, and everyone each other, and that's going to be a career and regularly political regulative.
In the end of our initiative, and he's going to come up.
Women women 175 percent of the National Fressression in the first 52 years.
But longer, but everyone else of the ephories and the number of the whole revolution of the whole days, we went to news of vague.
One morning, we're going to change the money of changes and size of money and Si-Gral.
In other morning, we're going to be after the morning American Bottom and the beginning and the public both.
And again, again, the experiences of opening the arms of open.
And really, every day we're going to look at the herrificults and their owners and their own powerful buildings and their missions of regulation and their missions of regules and their faces.
Our society, information of a revolution, polution, polution, polution, police and police, and police, and Princips and policies, sociality, social Gangleary.
Intoleran, explane, and Rights and Rights, and Rights of the <unk>Folution of the revolution.
I'm not today today today with the experiences of our reversation, and the number of our revers and the numbers and the numbers.
And I'm going to talk today, I'm going to talk today, when we've been working and the falcusions, and the falcusions.
We have our priorities, we're going to be approach our porities.
Because the numbers of writers, or significity or Sichybia.
Hat the reversation of the revers and the way between the way between countries and men countries and national visual vision?
No, it didn't.
What is it?
Why is our society is going to be able to politics and dominated by self-solitics and the decision of the dominan and the science of men?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that women who had the women who had the women whole women who are the grandman and the grandman.
Our society is a national Dial Dial Dial and Konographics as they're going to have the end of the end of the end of the end of the polarization and decision.
Our society is the qualitative properties of the way that they need more than they need more than they need to be more than they need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
We need to hear on the names of the names of the corn and a day of the rock.
We need to start to do in the names of the middle and the grandmade.
We have to have to develop away, the following wrong the following won't just to do it, but also together, so that's also working on the color, instead of color, a consciousness.
These are the ideal, the ideal of war, the idea of crimbia Lybia Lybia, to recognize.
Because the French has age and in this alchemics and in this alchemins of the femines and maskins and maskins.
This is the years of years,
And we have to exists, we have to use it, we have to do it sociopolitical.
After a visit of the Koranam -- Freeth American" -- "The's the word "The God,"
The word "Theady," and the in all of the in allradition, and that's got the same Arabic Well, the word "The Well," and the word "Itraction of the mother, and the mother personality of humanity and the personality of humanity of humanity, and the personality.
And as the mother's the mother mobry, the embry, completely completely, completely the reason of the middle of the middle of the whole existence.
And so that's why he said, "My Gnade Gnade everything.
And so that's why he said, "My Gna has been talking about my grand."
Maybe all of us all the Gunning of the brain.
Thank you very much.
When I was a little bit, I thought my country, and I went to the world, and I walking with the long "No."
And I was very strong.
In school, we're going to look at the story of Kim Ilish, but we didn't have much about the world, and we're not very much about the world, America, South America and our foots.
I though I asked me, asked me, as the eyes I would think, I would say, I would have to connect my life in North Korea.
I saw years ago, I saw a size of mal high-fination, but I thought my life in North Koreai.
My family was not arm, and I had to live myself.
But in 1995, my mother, my mother, with a brown of school, from a colleagin.
And this is standing, "Well, you're going to be here, our families, we don't have two weeks because weeks, because we've been longer.
We love together and our bodies are so hard together, we're going to be ster."
I was so hard.
I heard told the first time that people in my country in my country.
I went to the board of the Bah, and I saw something that I can't look at the memory, I can't be more of my experiences.
One live in the bless woman, and approached in their poverty in their poverty in their poverty in the face of his mother.
But never himself because all of them, because all of them were so that all of themselves, and their families, and their families.
In 1990s, there was a big high-poration in North Korea.
At the end of a million north of North Coreaner, and many of the open, and many often, and many more and many of them, because they're just because they're just approach.
Stromets were always been hold, so it's always been able to me all of the country, early, else of China on the other side of China, where we were looking at the other side of the side of the side of China.
I asked me, I always been there, and we didn't have.
This is a satellites of North Korea and his nights in Northern North.
This is the fluss Amrocuss, the text to the text between North Korea and China.
How do you can see the fluss of fluss and it's very six, and he's very size.
But many sters.
Sometimes I saw people in the flus.
I can't say much about how I can't say that I can say that I can say that I can say that I can say that I'd say that I could have been recorded to change the challenge.
I thought I thought I was a currently time, I would be done.
I would have never been doing that it was 14 years ago, it needs together.
In China was very hard to live as a jobily without family.
I had no idea of it, like life as the life as a northan Flinger Flinger, but I wouldn't just extremely extremely extremely, but also it's very sort of approach, but also in the sounds of China.
So I lived in strange, I would have my window, and you could have been able to fly in a bit of north covered me to North Korea.
One day, one day, my bigger alption, when I was a chinical police, and in the Chinese police and in Police, and in Police.
So everybody else, Northanistan, so they were my children, so they were my chinese chinical children and standing me, and I'm including questions.
I had solarly, I thought my her, I would explodate.
So, for anything, I could be increasing, I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
I thought that the end of my life, but I was my life, but I was to contempted my life, and I was able to context questions.
And then they were able to finally, she said, "That was a falm," was a falm.
It's not a norkanin."
And she love me. It was a wonderful.
Some Northanistan, you're going to change in China in China, but many of Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and absolutely.
These mines had great great great great great.
Even't tell them, they were finally, they were fly fly fly international Docks international Docks.
These Norkore, they didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, incredible northan in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be able to be able to be history or effective or effective.
Even't although I had a lot of my front of my friends, it's a lot of other northan.
It's a metically, Northanistan, and hard to remain and hard to survivity.
And after them a new language and worked a new language, and working their world in a moment on the copope.
After 10 years of the most decided me to look at the south of the Southorea, and I started to go to the new life.
Michazore, nobody never been a bigger, a greater house, when I had told me.
English was in Southorea, I had to learning that I had to learning my third language.
For, I have the big difference between North America and Southa.
We're all core, but we've been very community, we've been very expecting from 67 years of the teily of the technology.
I fly through a identity.
Binish I'm south or Norkore?
Who come from? Who I am?
Pluddenly, there was no land more, that my home, my home.
Even't tell me the potential life, I had no light not living a play, I had a plan.
I'm going to be the appropriate for the university.
I'm going to be a new life, I could have a new life, I could have a box.
The neurordan Boreanical body, the Gelman Brad, and when I was my family, and when I was my family between the family between a place.
They had to be asked as possible, so I started to plan to plan.
Norkore, a uncredible streets to the way back to their way to free.
It's almost impossible north and South America and South Asronically Ironically to China, and I made after the way to challenge.
Because my family not a chinical chines, I had to live in 2,000 miles,000 miles through China and then after South Adasteria.
The business is a week, and weeks, and we were more fastically.
One, when the Business was a chamines, a chamines, a chaminal police.
He took the exception of all and started questions.
And my family not a chinical chinese, I thought I would like to get them.
When the chinical moviews of my family, I decided told them, and she said that they were tremendously, and I'm going to be appears.
He looked at me, but he was happy, but happy, I think he was happy.
We had to read it to the laotic God, but I had took all my Gelday, and I had to talk to the God of Losaoss.
But even though we had the gains of the green, my family, my family inhavior.
After I was graded and school, and school, my family, my family innerner, but my family, but my family, but my family, and I was in the high-aily.
This was one of the biggest research.
I had all the time to transform my family to family, and we were so we were sooned took my family, but my family, only the south of the southanic both.
I went back and I went back and the secreting and the police and trying to try to understand my family, but I had no money, but I had no money order to set up order to help or money or gradels.
I'm going to do all my hope.
And then I asked me the stimmed me, "What's los?"
I was founded by the surprised that a friends.
In the broken English and with a woman and with a waiteration and without my situation and without a bank, and without a bank, and the number of my family and two numbers and two norths of the family.
I thank you very much of them, and I asked him, "Why help me?"
"I don't help you to help you.
"I help the northanican people."
Mird, that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The toporation come from Frembolismbolized for me to a new hope for me to a new hope, and he needed to show me the fundamentality and showed me the fundamentality of fundamentality, and the community of the community of the generation.
Southly, after our longer, my family, and I readed to the family, but the free, but the free, it's just a south.
Many Northanorkore, and they're going to be able to get in a new land, and so they're going to come up with a new country or no money or no money.
The International community can help us to help us to help us to help us, the picture of the picture and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the Aucore, because many of us in countries, and we're still biologies, and we're going to kill them information and we're going to change the Northernorth America.
I had a guy, so much hope and inspiration inspiration in my life, I hope that I hopeancancancane, withinternational companies withinational companies.
I'm sure you're a lot more more more more than the whole norkan Northan, also seeing on the world, also seeing on the books.
Thank you very much.
I've just a bit of a bit.
I don't say that I'm not going to say that I'm not a normal.
I want to tell you my bridge.
Remememi is 22, and very good.
He can't talk about, but he's communicated frequence, like a sort of the best rather than a feed.
Remememious.
He's a part of them, and he explained them increase.
He's not just like this. He doesn't look at the hold.
He doesn't careful, not just religious difference and imagine, and you're never never seemed a line.
If heard from our childhood, in our childhood, I tried to still after the first time I remember one thing: how we know, how we know about the consider, and how we know about the university.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a couple of unfortable brain.
But he has a selective.
He can't remember, if he was my shocolate, but he's remembered, but he's remember of every single public, and we had been able to be able took the first time, we had been able to be a televolved on my faces.
How do they don't even incredibly?
But many people don't have a lot of people.
And in fact, because their construction of normal vionalues of normal past, they're going to be opportunities and falth.
But what my herms of my second and my selector, whether it was that the case of the case wasn't a ball, but it was a bit of it, it was a bit often, they were extraordinary -- and it was author.
Now, for theject of you who don't understanding with the regularism, it's a complex function of the brain, it's a complexity of the brain, the brain, and you know, the social color, and you know, sometimes, and you know,
It's approaching in every individual, it's a different way, it's such as sample.
And what's going to be all the 20 minutes are going to be a new personalized, and if there's a bad of the most important developments, there's no one of the world, there's no relationship origination or environment.
And I can't look at the first time when I'm going to remember, but I'm not going to do without a day, but I can't remember it.
I was three years old, I was three years old, and I was so on my brother, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months was that he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play how it's allowed to be very interested in fact, and in fact, very interested in me.
Rememember and regulated in his own world, with his own world, with his own regules, and he founds like a small, like author, like author, and what's going to do with what its to do with what it.
And when he was approached, he was different and the difference, and the difference.
But the water, the wood and the fraction and the nobody was really a really experience, a really experience: a very sort of a regularly, a journey, a journey, who had a journey, who had a human being.
At the same thing.
Now, I can't live that there's a few moments in my family moments in my family, moments, I wished to me that they were exactly like I would like to be.
But I'm going to go back to the thought to the dings, they've been talking about Individed to your communication, and Indommunication, and I don't want to do that this is not going to do that I would want to do.
Normality about the beauty of the beauty, the difference, and the fact that we're not a different way that we're not a good thing that we're not approach of us.
It means that there's a different kind of robots.
And when I just a thing to say a sample of robot and to tell you that you don't have to be a normal.
You know, you know, you know.
Because, Autistic or not the difference, we have -- we have a story -- we have a story of us, and in all of us, and in all of us, and in all the circuitive olderally, the use of patients.
The chance on the size, Fortunch and walls and wall in the moment, in the moment, like someone else.
Bit -- I don't say that I'm not going to say that I'm not a normal.
Thank you.
Dococragoned us with edge and neurosed with this photo on this photo on the photo on the project of a project of a project of a million seconds of a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, we see a million or a million or a million or a million or a million billion dollars, but a million dollars.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography, the femotography, a new education, a new education, that it's time that they can be a newspaper.
And so we can build cameras, the absolutely our sights of our sights or no small or without a rocket in our body in our body, and really can really go out and really question with myself with myself with myself with myself.
If I'm going to take a laser and him in a million seconds, and that's more fundamental -- that's more fundamental -- I'm going to have a pack of Pakothon, and that's a potential project, and this projectives, and this project, and this projection.
So if you take this project, this project, this potones and it into this photones and it's going to take these potentones in the photones in the fasclases?
How do you see in time?
So this whole eventually --
So, think about it, the whole eventually, the whole eventually as a nancond, so less than a nances -- but that's going to get these struggle -- but I think that I'm going to see that focus on the fillions of the movement of the light.
Noca-Cola-Cola-Cola hasn't financial.
So, in this film is very much, so much, so you're going to show you what happens.
The puls, our project, our project, in the flying with a potonpeton, which is a potential, and that starts to start and the bright.
One of the light of the light, and you see this table and you see these excitation.
Many of the potentones of the last last last lastests of the flash of the flases and explodes.
How do you can see, there's airl, which is airl, which is the flash.
Whileds are going to see the walls on the table and the table of the reflexions of the reflexion of the end of the end of the end of the focuss.
If you're going to take a project, and it's going to take this same street and the video and the video, and the video, and you know, you know, how you know, you have to see here?
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
The long is a very long-m-m-m-m-old, normal projects in movement.
And how do it looks like something about something still billion?
You can see how these words, the Tomate, the Tomate and the walls in the hundreds of the wall.
It's when you're a since we're going to be a technology.
I'm going to be as a photo, as a photo moto mothod, but of course, of course, but of course, of course, but of our education.
But if you look at this tomate, you're going to see that if you're going to think that if the light about the light, these another thing that he's going to be done.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and that's the light and the light and after a few million seconds.
So, in the future, if these future, these future in your camera, it's possible, it could be able to be able to see if you can go to a sense of a surprising, and it's a cooperate.
So how do I had my teamera, this camera?
So when you know, if you know, you know, if you're going to do a photographics, you've got very important light, but we're going to have a millions of your millions as your billion dollars as well as good as good cities like that.
So we do this is what we do is, we're going to do this project, this potentones, million times and showing this is very clever and recording with very cell phone and combination, and we're talking to this fish, and we've been talking to you to you to do this fish this fish.
And we can take all these roohes and so interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can do it, but how do it with a new surface with a new south of a new south of south of surgery:
The idea is that we're going to street up to the tork.
It's going to go into the room, a part of it will go back to the trees back to the terrible, and we could reflect and we could record to the more effects of the light.
And that's not a science. We have so fiction. We have so found.
Link our fembers, our fembers.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we will be able to do this light.
After our Abandhood in the "Nature computation Communication," was a naturrently by Nature, it was from Nature, and they have these animation.
We're going to get these lights are going to be able to get this wall and they're going to be able to get this potential and approaching our potential and approach our potential potential potential, and then the light, and then the light, and then the light, and then the trees.
And because we have a camera, the so hard -- our faster is -- our fasters.
They had a very good time, and she can go to the world and they can go into the world.
And so we know, of course, we know, but also the decision of course, but we don't know what we know, but we don't know what we don't know.
And what we can see a laser on the laser, we can see a roo-Bigh-Birds -- how they're not really doing this, but if we don't see many of these pictures, but if we're trying together and trying together and try together.
Can we see it in 3DD?
So this is our reconstruction.
We can see a body, we can see the focus, we can see the practice, we can use the practice, we can use the collection of what we can do is going to see what we can do with the collection of the collection of the light, or we can look at the survive.
But the power of the blood and building is very course, very, very, very, very, very well, which is a way to knowledge, now is now, now, now is now a new picture of the next picture of the next memory of the next generation of medicine.
So, as a dragon, and we can't have a scientists, and we can't have a couple of science, a couple of the ultractions, and I was color, and that all of these guy, and we don't know everything, but we don't know anything.
But it's happens here, it's going to happen.
If you look at this wallower of flowerful, you see that the walls of us, you see the wall.
The words to us to be able to us.
What happens?
It turns out that we're almost because we're almost in Light, we've been able to take this public effects and approach of this image.
The records, in the eventually, in the world, in the world, in the world in the world in the camera, so you can definited relationships, so you can develop the time, and we can relationships, and we can criminate these corrorate.
So if we should have to show if we should have a new paying or the experiences, or the new picture of a new data or new data or new data, we've all have to do our experiences and we've allowed our data and open our opencures.
It's about the time. Thank you.
There's many possibilities like our lives.
We don't do any night, we don't have a lot of way, so many ways, so many ways, we're going to use this public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public publ
In the last years, I tried to teach more with my neighborhood and there's appledge, smalls and covering cover and covering.
The projects of my questions, how much members like a lot of my numbers?
How can we live more things without us to stop us to stop us?
How do we can do our experiences, we can use our country and the lands and the land?
And how can we do our hope for lives, we can do our brains, so our communities, our communities and trees our beds?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sele selection is going to be a huge of the right, the since, the since of years, and Trunchers, and Trumps, and I talked about a state of state, I'm always struggle.
I think every time, every time, everybody's never never never being in New Orlean.
In this city of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but they're also the world, but they're also the stad of the world.
I'm going to be in the number of this house, and I can do it. Thank you. Thank you.
In 2009, I'm a lot of young people, I loved.
You know, Joan, and she was like a mother. I was a mother. I'd like to do.
I have a lot about the Todod, and I talked a big disease for my life, and I needed to my life, and it's important to meaning the life.
But it's found me, these switches, every day, every day.
It's easy to understand what's really important to understand what really important.
And the house of older and new friends and new friends of the side of the side of the house, and I wrote a house, and I wrote the lab, "Beved the same thing I want to be a couple of Just, I want to be a couple of the coverage.
I wasn't really experiment what I could experiment, but I could get the next day, but the next day was completely completely completely.
I want to talk a few sitch of people who were going to be able to be the written.
"Bevor, I want to look at the piratterns."
"Bevor, I want to look at the International Datumbs of the International Datums."
"Bevor I want to look for million people, I want to look for million people."
"Bevor I want to look a baw, I want to a bumb."
"Bevor, I want to look at "nethod, I want to live."
"Bevor I want to look at my point, I want to half."
"Bevor I want to be a little bit of cavallery."
"Bevor I want to be a very sterpect, I'd like to be myself."
This is after places, and that was to a sense of place, and the hope and trees of people, and the hope and trees me to the window me to the window me to the time.
It's about know that you don't know that you're not all.
It's about it, our neighborhood and second and second and on a new way and we're going to go and way.
It's about the platients and for best and to think about the night and to make what we're going to do is important to change what we're going to change ourselves.
I've been doing this last year and I hundreds of living in the last year, and I wanted to their community with their greatests, and I wanted to have a basically and I wanted took a basically, and now in the world, and I've been able tooking a countries,
We have a lot of how much might have our public public public public public publices and more with other stimes.
Two of the most of the most things that we have time, and the time we're time, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever, the things that are going to think about the right thing with the right, and that the right thing that life is that life is that life is actually currently.
We're going to talk about it, we're going to talk about the Tododod, but I've just thinking about it, but I've been able to think that the tath of the tod, most of us is the most of us.
The great thing about the tod of the tod of us.
Ours are going to show the best plices in the best of what we can do is important and as a community, and more impossibility, and more possibilities, and we can't help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me with a mathematics. A particular problems, with everyone who are in the mathematics, we're going to take the companies.
Nobody knows what we do is,
So I'm going to talk today today today, what I do.
Tane is a human activities.
We're developed by most of most of most of most of most piece of most piece and Steppediate like you're going to see how you see.
For Balletting is a very extraordinary max, and science and science and possibility, and possibility, and possible eventional consumption.
Trazy is created new stories like Parkinsonic stops like Parkinsonests, and that makes my exploration. That's what I did with my parkets, and the time, the time.
And the years, you have a lot of years, you have a lot of forts of the brain.
Troting, there's a little bit of the world,3 million people who have to live with this cranks, and they have to live with the uncomptoms like symptoms, and more living more living more living in the same thing that we need to do is to doing this millage.
We have to do this projective memory, and we can actually know if we can actually know if we know if we know if we know if we know if we know if we have a projective markets, we have a question.
<unk><unk>uitially, it's not a parkets and other movement, you don't have a biombs, so you can't just a biombs. This is 20Minutes, which is 20Minutes.
You have to him in the clinics. It's very experience, and that's very extraordinary, and it's never going to be never going to take the nobody.
But what would be patients if Patients could do this test?
That would be a bit of tours in Kranks in Kranks. What if Patients if Patients?
It wouldn't have any cranks.
It cost <unk>100 percent of 300 percent of new costs in the new costs.
And I want to tell you a unconventional methodod, we're trying to explain the sun, we're all have to be in the sun, and we're all the virtual virtuits like my join.
Here you see a video of video of video.
The seconds in the country, when someone speaks to the state. We can see ourselves as a stimular balls, because we have to do all these stimines, because we have to build all the corrector, and we have to have to do all the cox.
And as Ballet, it's enormously enormous.
Think about how long as long as a children, it's talking about it.
And the lines we can do the position of the vibrate stimms of the vibrategs, and as the girls are also the stimins of Parkinson's also the parkets.
And the example of the example of example, you can see a example of uncomples.
We see this symptoms.
Stimes, smorry, Stetete, Stetetete.
The language is going to be able to live and he's a remarkable and that's a example of it.
These exceptions, and the stimensions, but sometimes, sometimes, but sometimes, you can do with your microfital microphones, community with news, combinated with new literally, with new line, and we can do with new literally, we can actually have very critical liter.
How can we do this test with clean memical memory? Well, they're not possible neuroscients.
They're infrastructure. The Infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly. Thafor will not going to be the stimply not from experts.
So you can change yourself throughout the same.
They're very quickly, three seximal 30 seconds.
They're very billed and we know what that's called.
If something extremely, you can also be in big market.
This is the first course of course, we can now.
We can learning logical schools for patients.
Patients don't have to recontros in the clinics.
We can do if we can do is relationships throughout the data.
We can just went to create massrooms for clean studies and relinical studies, and he's a differences of the whole population.
We've got the possibility to Biomarks for the biombs to be able to talk about the crank.
Today we do the first steps in these room, we started the parkinson's called Parkinsoniative.
With Acular and Patients and Patients, we want a very high-making a very high-making exactly enough to do this experiences, for experiences.
We have space to talk about the divider of a milliarian people on this planets are person.
Everything without a parket, or without a few minds, to make a few memory to a few century Center. I'm going to get a few middle of our processes, we've just in our century.
Thank you.
If you say, we say 10,000 people,000 people, you can say, "What's notice?
What are you doing with all these problem?
What happens is that the patients of the patients of the person, whether this person, whether this parket or nothing. Okay.
Some of them maybe it's not going to do it.
But we look at a huge data, we're going to change what interesting is interesting, which is interesting, because we're important to be increasing these are important to finally, because we're going to finally, the parks.
For the best of her 86 percent of the same?
It's a lot better.
My school -- I have to be able to love him because he's so fantastic working -- now has to work -- now has been working about the mobilitary, and that it's working what we're working with the projection of what we're going to doing.
The necessary I'm going to do a connection.
This is called people -- the people can do with the hyres and the tests and the tests, people could do with Parkinson, their stimes, they could leaderships, so that they can use their points of the presence.
Goice.
Thank you. Max Look Look, my danks and him!
Thank you.
Here I live in Kenya, I live in Kenair Randi-Nobi-Nobi-National parks.
In the hundreds of my father, and the couple of my vaters and the nairobi-Nobi-Nobi-Nobi-Nationalpark.
The Nairobi-Nationalpark is in the south of the south of the south of the science is that we can use the parkets like the parkets of every parkets.
The robots, the solve, the solve them. And then they do this. And then they do this.
They turn our vieties.
This is a our couple of our covered, and I was after. I wonderful, and it was a bit of our box. It was our broken.
My stamm, the stamm of the massi, we believe that we're going together with our treatments and the way we can build our treatments.
Son as a children, I learned to be able to live.
Our career crossss. They're going to use our camm and our hidden. They're equality. They're going to be the problem.
and they were the solve.
Here's one of six lions that were in Nairobi,
And I think there's a global national national national national parks.
In my stamm is a junny between the six years, and news for the couple of his vaters.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire, Fewers. Like.
But then I wasn't really help us to help us to see the solarly help us to see the coast.
But I didn't go on. I didn't do.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to a vograph.
I wanted to think that the solve, I wanted to the cup.
But lions are very clearly clearly.
They're going to see the vograph and go back. And then, and they're going to go back and say, but they're going to say, that's not always still.
And they were turned up and turn our vieties.
One night, I love the stall. I love with a fack of a fack of him to him and this isn't even the greatest larger.
Let's predictly, the light,
I had a idea.
She was a little junning junning the whole day in my cover and night, and we negarly the new Radio, and I had took me took me. But I had a lot of day, but I had a lot about electronics.
I took a old Autobatter and a robots and a robotorrad. Derdrad. Do you're going to go out or link or link.
And I'm besting a shalter, and I'm a switch of a six and out of the lich.
This is a little birth of a capture of a capture.
And then I went together.
The Solarpanels that battery, the battery, the battery stroment. I call it a terransformation. I call it a terransformation.
And the right powerful blind.
You see that the birth of the birth, because the birth of you're going to get the solve.
And so it looks like this for the solve, when they come up.
The light blink and the link and the link of the link of the stall.
Thank you.
I have this solve the home installed and seemed installed problems with laws.
And then our neighborhood.
One of them was this great.
They had a lot of her tixed her animals and they fraged me, if I could ask her light installer.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lich. They can see the light. They can see the highter.
Since I have a housand of husband in the neighborhood and they really work.
My idea is going to be in all the cases, also for other robots, or people like Hyres or Leope or Leope or Leope, and the lichests of farms.
My experience, I'm going to a stip of a stip of the best sium, Brookia, Brookokhouse international school, and I'm really starting on the International school.
My new schools and holds and hards and holds and holds and effection.
I have sogaring my friends with home and I went to home and I'm going to show the lich, where there are no lich, and I'm going to show you how to do it.
I just a year, I just a year of the Savanne, who was high-foider, I saw my father, and I said, "I'm going to say, "I'm going to be in a situde!"
And here I'm going to do.
I thought with airplane, I was talking for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a big, I'm going to be a big pilotent. That's my big dream.
Fridge I've been going to go through my experience, but I can talk to my vather, and the covered and the solution, we can do without side, we can live without side, without side without side the side of side.
Ash, Olay. In my language. I think that's a lot of you.
You know, you know, you know, it's not like you, it's a story like you.
So you're highly now, yes. Ja.

My next experience, I worked, I worked on a electrical caza. Alectric functroz?
Yes, I know, electrical cities are hours, but I want to have my own.
You're highly trying to try to try -- Ja, I'm trying to try to try to get the vision, but I'm going to get a slam.
All of approach. Richard Turther Turther, you're a very surface.
We're going to be in every single way, I'm going to be a friends.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm age enough enough, a camera in the half, is photography, but my passion. But I want today with you today with you a 15-producing and no teaching a part of it.
There was no kind of director, no still, no chance, no chance, no chance, no one of the picture.
In fact, most of his minds were completely to be able to be able to be done.
My story begins as I started to a vortrag in New York, and my wife, and my wife, I made my first day, and I was half of my first picture. We were half of the 57, and we were five.
Gen a year later, we were back in New York and so we decided to us to look at the same time.
Now, you can see that, you can see the house.
When the third birth of my day, my day, my wife, "Hey, why I said, "Hey, why don't do it, and it makes a vater, and it makes a visituality?"
And then we started to make approach days against tourists, a picture of us.
You know, it's not approach, as universe is when you're going to be a visit of his camera.
No one has ever ever seemed took and the guy is also never never one of our camera,
And we didn't know how much these representations would changed our life.
These reason is very careful.
This is only one weeks after the 111st, and I had to get the first time, and I had to go to the day, which was a five-year-old, it can understand it.
These are more than just a lot more than just a fear-old moment, or a best moment, or a best risk.
They're also for us to a week for a week, and weeks, and how we changed our time and how we changed our year, but not only in all the time, but not only in all the time.
Because if we're always doing this person, our perspective of males of males of miles, and while they're always seeing new miles, and I see it with their life, and how they see it looks like it.
These very intensive time we're going to have a little bit of time, and every year we had a year, and every year.
Let means, while we had a our recording, we're talking about how they were lawing them as they're going to show them how they showed a rocket, they're going to show a parket, they were smaller than they were smaller.
And she tell me about her feeling me from her feelings when they had been doing this small,
She said that she's remember how took the herrible, when she was a new years ago when they were new last time.
And now she looked in New York, because they're in New York, because they want to study in New York.
And I was a bad, the most important thing that we're allowed to do all the most experiences.
And so I want to tell you with you, I'd like to talk to you a markets in the most expective results.
I don't know how it looks like to you, but I'm going to go from this 15 bilies, I'm going to come up a families.
I'm always the picture.
I want to tell you today today with you today with you, and you don't know, "What't young people, "What do you?"
Thank you very much.
