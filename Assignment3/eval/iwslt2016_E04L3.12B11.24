When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clen whole fire fire.
My father heard about his little bits, women Radio the news of the news of the BBC.
He looked very happy, very happy to what was happy in the next thing that was the next thing that was the next thing.
He rule: "The Taliban are female!"
I didn't know what that means that means, but it made my father, very happy.
"You can go on a right school," he said, "I'm going to go.
The morning I'm never been able to food.
All right school.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I spent it to school.
So I five years, I five years, I five years long as a junk, and I started my older sister, not more of all, and more of all of the slime.
Only so we could go to school.
Every day, we could never went to a different way that he could never went to where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went.
We've been able to buy our books in the left, so we could just look like this.
And we were in a house, we were in a house in a small wall in a little wall.
In the winter was, but in the summer, but incredibly, it's uncredibly hot.
We all know that we knew that we knew our lives: teachers and our parents and our parents.
In the until the difference of the difference for a week of a weeks because the taliban being.
We were never been looking at how much they knew about us.
Do they recorded?
Where do they know where we know where we know where we know?
We had angry, but we wanted to school.
I had great happiness in a family in a family, in the education as important and taken.
My grandfather was his time.
One of a siterally from a provinced provincial provinced to be afghanistan -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- my father -- and it was able to be able to be able to be father.
My mother filks, but it was teacher.
That's what it's.
And two years ago, she went to the rhest of our house in a school for mice and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here's the first time -- the first time, who was a school that you ever remained a school.
For him, it was a children would be a children would be a children, also would be a children, even his trots the taliban, trops all risks.
He looked like a much bigger risk of his children don't go to school.
I know that I know that I was in the years ago, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes from our lives, from our lives, from our lives and the perspective.
I had good loss, I had to say, "The father said, "Thatter, you can hear it in your life.
The money can be carbon. You can be recognize in war.
But one thing is going to be done, and that's what's going on here, and even if we have to do with our blood for your blood for your bubble for your bubble.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I'm in a country of war.
Less than 6 percent of my alters have a higher than the seconds as the seconds as the secondarchy. And when my family, and when my family for my school, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm going to be here as a statement of the Middlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather, who was my grandfathered by his family, because he was family, because he was a greater to school, one of the first one of the first one of the most family.
He doesn't just feeling with my hands, but also too, but also I was the first woman who I was the first woman who was footing with the car.
My family believed me.
I have great deeply, but my family has larger animals for me.
So I'm a global both of the global bottom of the world's a global campaign for the education of women.
So I've been going to go to the SOLALA, and maybe the first internator for mice in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country, in the school.
It's wonderful to see how the schools with my school with great early, all of them all of them all of them, all of them,
And to see how their parents and various for them, like my parents, and I'm going to be able to decided all the walls.
So as Ahmed. That's not being name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my father.
And he was a months were his daughter and he's been on the home of SOLA in their data, and they're just going to be able to get a bombs.
When he was home, he came up with the phone and a voice and a voice, he was going to be falls, he would be able to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "The said, "There's like you want to be the future of my daughters, I'm going to set up to play the older and overcome."
What Afghanistan, so I have something that I've got something that's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to see the explane that the walls that the walls of us, and the walls of his daughter, and it's also being.
That's not today that our mothers don't have any important role in our experiences.
Thank you are harmers who are harmers who are able to record a lot of a lot of a lot of future of their type of their type of their type of the society of the infghanistancial men.
On the Taliban went to school, just went back to school -- because it was some of the school -- because it was illegal.
But everyone in Afghanistanistanistanistanistan, the schoolbanks.
Afghanistan, from America, from America,
The Americans are recognize as us as well as well.
I'm noticed that the change of the change of the U.S. and they're changing the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I'm sleeping in my school, and their parents, and their parents that they're going to take a lot of them, then I see a lot of future, I see a lot of walls.
Afghanistan is for me to a country, and the uncomfortable possibilities, and it's remembers that sOLA.
And as I think they have great trees.
Thank you.
All I do what I do is, also -- my life -- my life -- my life -- my life was in Africa as a young manufacturing the man.
In 1971, I see, I see, I'm looking at 1977 -- I've been in Sambia, Kenia, Kenia, Kenia, Algeria, Algeria, and Somalia projects with African countries.
I've been working for a half of a single project, and every single project that we're looking at the box.
I was survey.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people are good working in Africa, and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed all of what we did.
Our first project, what my first project, which is my first book, "Ripples inspiration," inspired, one that we wanted to show you how numbers of people want to show how nation is going to show you how nation is going to show you.
We came withinalia South America, in South America, in this took the Sambia, which is the Sambia Flussia, and we lived the southernic relationships and tales.
Of course, the answer was nothing involution, so we didn't have an interesting, so we're working for the work, and sometimes they're also telling them.
We were first often, we were in a so early not a so early country.
But instead of followed why they said, why they said, "God, we just say, "God's what we're here!"
"Gode," to return the people to return the people to return the prediction."
Of course, of course, in Africa.
We had this practice, we had this practice. In Italia, they were so big, in Sambia,
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Shouse, like just Landwirt is just like skin."
When the tomates were red, came out about 200 Night, about 200 Nilparts and fly out of the flow, and asked everything.
We said, "Oh God, God, God, the Nilpefering!"
And they said, "Yes, we have no country, we don't have a country."
"Why didn't say, "I'm not said, "I've never been asked us."
I thought, we were so greater in Africa, but then I saw what I saw what the Americans doing what the Englands that the Englands, which was doing what they did was doing.
We felt like the nilks to the nilks.
They should see the university -- you should see the university we don't look at the uncertain people.
They should be the book "Thead Aida Moyoyoyo, she's a sambic economic economic economic economy.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have changed the African continent 1,5 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been telling.
Let's just like her book.
Let me tell you about a African, what we've been story.
We're involved in the missions, colonialists, missions, and there are two poories, like we're going to go to people or we're patriarch.
And in the words of the latines of the latines, which means "Vather" means "Vather."
But they have two different conditions.
Patriarchalic: I'm sure everyone else, as if they were my children. "I love my children.
Patronizing: I'm sure everyone else, as if they were my distributed my dynamic.
That's white people in Africa, "bana", Chefana, Cheful,
I was afterwards when I was the book "Small" from school," from school, he said, he said, he said, "Somen, if people don't want to go into the rule, then they want to go into Ruhead.
This should be the first principle of the head.
The first principle of the heart is Respe.
Today, the morning of the herror, who's the conference, a stab, and asked, "Can you're going to be a city, don't have a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to reactive people, and he's going to reactive companies, and he never motivated something that's never going to be able to be able to be a young people who are going to be hear the distribution of the distribution of the distribution of the distribution of the
What you do -- you're doing -- you're doing.
You never never never been a community with ideas with ideas with ideas with the only one of the voice.
We don't work from Bros.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Know.
We don't have infrastructure.
We flying friends and find out what the person wants to find what person wants to find.
The most important is the most important thing.
You can ever remember one idea.
When these person doesn't do that?
The passion for the own words of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own words is the most important thing.
We help them to find the knowledge that can never be able to find anyone can be record.
The person with the idea hasn't know that science is not available.
A lot of years ago, I had this one: Why didn't have this community and saying, why do we want to say why do we hear it? But not to say why don't we hear it? But not in Gemmination.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
Our companies have never been part of the neverage, and they're going to say what they want to do with their money, which they want to see what they're seeing.
Planation has this blind.
The course of the community of the community, because they never created to public trees.
We worked to do this to do this to do this, to do this, it has to be a social infrastructure that don't exists.
One new boxes are going to be a new box.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedroom, who's in the house of your head, and in the caf<unk><unk> situde, you're going to find your lives, your lifetime information, to find your lives.
I have this in the experance, West-Australia, trying to try to trying to trying to do this.
I was promovated to the time and trying to decided to decided where we should say, what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had to helped up in the first three days of my first customers, and I half of my first customers, he was halfished him. I was him. I half. I him.
I hold this fish, and I'm working on this wonderful three-ban-bany for 60 cents, but in Albany for 60 cents, but for Japanese for 150 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I do something very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
I hold the mouth and highly."
So -- -- so -- so, the government: "Mach it."
We've been made it in 300 general community.
We have 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go on a new generation.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the best companies of the story, a few years ago.
Peter pressure was Philosophy was posophy, before he was able to companies with companies: Peter pressure said, Peter pressure, in fact, increasingly uncomfortable and economy."
Planation is the death of the death of the companies of the companies.
So you're looking at Christians to know what the covery of human christries with their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get to a little bit of a tool.
You have to help them distribution and privacy, you have to help them. You have to help them to help them, and they're going to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the people?
For example of practice, you've been able today?
<unk>romic, easy people. The food. They have applications.
I want to say that the companies of the right way,
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nichervolution -- nicheless, fossil foots, and suddenly, and systems are not after.
The construction is not afterward.
The Freon-Aron-Aron-time is not afterward.
We have to look at how we look at the millions of people on the billion people on after we can record today, transporting to them with them, and with them.
The technologies don't existing.
Who is this technology for the green revolution? Universited?
The government? Do you go.
It's going to be invention. And they're going to do it.
I'm going to make a future in a future of a future of many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were the einglectricity to the future of the city of New York in the year in the year.
In 1860, they came together and speculated what happened in 100 years ago, which was happening in 100 years ago, the city was a city: The city wasn't existing never been existing in 100 years.
Why? You looked at the curve and said, and they said, when the population in this tempoint in this tempoint in this tempoids to listen to people who are increasingly impossible to be able to be able to figure out of millions.
Because they went to the mistake.
At 1860, they see the difficult technology that life looks like New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, 19001, there was 1001 Automobilically -- 1001.
The idea that was a different technology to find a different technology, and there was a little fabrics in the backgrics in the backland.
The Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with companies.
When he had to be able to be able to be able to be.
On the first thing they don't talk to you.
So when you have to recognize them, engaged and living invice, and live.
And then you have to recognize them over the companies of the companies.
From the little bit of the biggest company, all of the country, three things: The three things: The product that has to be able to reduction, the behavios, and his financial financial.
Rata?
We never have a single personal person who can make something produce a little bit of something that can cover the money can care.
That's not existed.
This person was never been born.
We have found fears and we've been involved the world of the world -- Carnegie, Westing, Edison, Edison, Ford, Ford, Google, Google, Google, Yoogle, Google, Yoogle, Yoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed all the world's allowed companies of the world, only one: No one: No one person.
Now, we're going to be 16-year-old in Northumbers and we started to start the first two side of Richard Branson Autonobiography Autonobiography Autony. The first 16-year-olds.
No one of the "ich" and 32 mal "wir."
He wasn't all, when he started.
Nobody's a company of a company. No one company.
So can we make a community, in the past, in the past, which is a little bit of the painting, in Caf<unk>s and bars, and your engaged caful, which is what they're going to do for this guy who had been done for this guy who has been talking about this else.
What can you make it? Can you make it?
Okay, can you record it? Can you record on the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Mell, you know that I'm going to finish?"
We're activate generate.
We have groups of freedoms that can be remote the companies that can be under the companies of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economic economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be like it, alice, alice in the wonderful.
The Penn State University of University -- a dotication -- a dotication -- attack in the communication --
I had angry --
It's not just approach of these students with their great brains and their great books and their books and their books and their books.
But as the conversation of the laws, it's like Alice, as age when she was looking for the canninlock, and a citizen world.
I felt like I felt like I was felt like I was talking about the students. I was first about the students, and I wanted to be able to decided that other words.
I think that to make this turt to open this termunication.
We need to change the great certain communication of our scientists and ingengenery and ingengengenes.
Because our scientists and insures are the biggest problems that our greatest problems, like, and instance, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and then I don't think it's not going to believe that we love in our consistants.
But these great large conversation doesn't come to understand our scientists and in their wonderful country.
So scientists and insures, bits, clearly, clearly.
I want to show you a few answer, how you can see that we can see that we can see that the science and the technology and the technology, and the technology, and I'm going to talk about it.
The first question that you have to ask us to be used, and?
Saybe we're just why we're just a scientific buildings so relevant for us.
Saybe not just saying that their dreams, but also says that they say that their draws us to say that their draws that they can be able to under our cooks, because they can understand why it's important to understand.
And when you're going to be able to do what you do is, then you're going to be able to do.
Forwards are a handledge of change.
And so, you could be sure her quite and pretty course, but why don't you just say, "Rume and time," and time, what much changes us?
Our general thought about it, is not the same as their nive, it's not the same as their nive.
As astein is, "Mache said, "Macheach the things like possible."
You can tell us something about you know about anything about eye, without a science without anything without the compromise.
A few things are involved to bring stories: For examples, stories, and analogies.
And when you worked on your work, then you're going to leave the story.
Hably you ever asked you ever asked why it's called "Stunct"?
What happens when someone else? All right? A different? All right? All right, and with these points.
A following how this is not just long, but also too much more in the long part of our brains, and we're working on the brain, and we're hard to be faster.
These example of Geneview Brown is much we can show you a lot of well-covery, that the special structure of the trees that they're so much inspiration for the inspiration of the inspiration of the effect of the effect.
The tick here is a single, just a simple simple satingle satingle, when it's audience, if it can be audience, orients, orients, organizing ourselves, and the other sense of the other sense of the other sense of the city and terrifying.
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these door and the wondering and the wonderful and the science and technology in business.
And so the ingengenery I've been undergrounded me to me, with the <unk>Nerd in me," I want to make all of the contact.
So, in fact, the science of science and eurosconomic figured out that's particularly, so that's important to say, and multiplicated the subjects that are important to be incredible for their work, and it's incredible. And it's incredible.
So scientists and insures, if you have this same thing, you know, clearly, clearly increasing me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my hand.
A handy can change a lives and a personal freedom.
With a handy can be a cell phone in Syria,
With a handy can do a news and a protestail and a protestailypes.
And with a handy can take a lower, it's highly high-Cloud and books.
All that's possible.
I'm a year 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in this city.
You can see how hundreds of people, like hundreds of people for change in the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989, and we're in 1989, and we've been able to change the cell phone in the task of the task.
Who is a handy has a handy?
Half you go.
Half you hold your hand, you hold, they hold!
Half you go. Asia, a bubble, a blackberry, wow.
These are many. Fast everybody has a hand.
But today about me and my hand, and I'm talking about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 350 ciles from the information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the Eur.
This reline is called Right is Rights to reline the reline.
This reline is that every particular plephants in Europe, everyone in Europe, every internet, every internet, a bandbreaker information.
Who is it? Who do you know? Who is a email?
Who is a SMS?
And if you're using a handy, where you're using.
All these information are going to be six months to two years to two years of your telephone or your telephone or your Internet, or your Internet.
And everywhere in Europe, people have said, "That's not want to say, "That's not."
They said, we wanted to these imagination doesn't want to be.
We want to be self-f-dime in the digital time, and we don't want to be the telephone and internet, and information about us to species about us.
There was answers, Journalists, Pace, Pace, who said, "That's not want to say, "That's not want."
And here you can see how couple of people on the streets of Berlin streets and said, "Freekness."
And somebody said, this could be the state of the state of 20.
The stasi was the brain was the brain.
And I asked me, whether this really works.
Can you really think about all these information about us?
Every time I'm using my handy?
So I asked my phone, I asked my phone, the distincts that the great telephone, and I was asked to be the greatest particularly information, and I asked me told me about their information that they've been talking about me.
And I asked them, and she wondered them, and they don't get a right answer. Nurururround.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is the pertocollated.
So I decided to do a general information, they wanted to have a bit of information because I wanted to have this information.
But the decision said, no telecom said, no, we're going to be able to give you.
At the end of it, it came to a construction with them.
I'm going to look back to the beginning of where they all send me all the information.
Because in the fundamental representation of the massive recording of the emotion of the evention of the decision.
So I'm going to have this half-making environment with a CD.
And on the CD was this:
350 ciles information.
First, I saw it, and I said, it's halt, it's huge. My Datei.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this dateift.
So I was a little bit of what should I do with this?
Because you see where I'm going to look where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information about this information.
I want to make them audience.
Because I want to show you what the people are representation means.
So in the open, and Open Data City, so I've been here.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reincoomen and radiooms, you can predict and back to the back.
You can make every step, because I do after I do.
And you can see how I can see from Frankfurt with the firm, and how many ants, and how many antswer.
All that's possible information.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
First, it's just like this, I'm like my wife and she's talking about a few mal with your hand.
And then I called me a few friends and they run a couple of friends.
And after a while you and you're looking at this huge, and we have this huge communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, to the time they're going to go to bed a couple of bed.
You can see all.
You know, you know, you know, about who are about who are about who are the leaders of the groups.
If you can see the information, you can see what the society.
If you have to recognize the society of society.
This is a box for countries like China and the Iran.
This is the perfect of perfectly, like you can see a society about how to be a society, because you know who is a possible, who's possible when you're possible when you have to do this information.
And these information are going to be months, for months, in Europe to 2 years.
As I said, we said, we asked that all these people in the streets in the streets in 19899 Handys in their tasks.
And the stasi, who would have been wonstration of the demonstration of the state, and when the state of the state, who would never have been going to happen.
The case of the blinder mouths maybe not stattle.
And also, not the case of the case of the case.
Because now, because of the fairs and companies like many information, like many information, like they can be conflicts, and often, online and often.
They want to be able to have our lives, and they want to be able to read the long long long long long long long long long long long long long long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as well.
But even self-f-dime and a life in the digital time.
But everyone has to be able to do for the self-making.
They have to be able to make every day.
So if you go home, you go home, you're going to say that Privacy is a wert of the 21st century.
If you go home, you're going to say your attention, just because only firms and state the possibility, and information, they don't have to specifically not doing it.
And if you don't believe me, you're going to believe your phone, you've talked about you've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you remember your handy, if you remember your handy, you're remember the self-dime memory in the digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituo faster, snellite, breaks, breaks.
So the city of course, so the city, and overlegral South Central South Central South Central Los Angeles, and it's changed it in South Los Angeles, which is something that's going to be able to be able to folutely.
This is South Los Angeles.
Firituoes, snells, snellite, breaks.
So as 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food South Central Los Angeles, the central Los Angeles, and the Drive-thrus and the Drive-bysis.
The comic is that the drive-thrus more people, more people are declocked than the Drive-bys.
People are south Central Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The father is crate in my fourth is pretty higher than about a hills of hills, and it's about 15 circa 15 circa 15 kirca.
I couldn't go to the more withans.
And I asked me, as you feel like you would have told me if you don't have to be healthy if you could have to go out of the house, if you look at the negative eative expectations that areas that the best system.
I'm going to buy the rule of the role and tells like buying.
I see Dial Dialysecialized like Starbucks like Starbucks.
And I was starting to hear that this is what we need to hear.
I capture that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and it's the solution.
And I had no loss, I had no loss to 45-minutes to get a field to get a pesticians in the presence in the presented in the presence.
So I popularly prediction of my house.
It's a piece of land, we call Parklage.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing that it's heard the city.
But you have to please it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is because it's my responsibility and I have to go into standard."
And I decided to hold it in standing.
So I came up and my group, and I got the L.A. Green reason, and we started together, and we started to predicts, and open, so that all the program, so that all the program, so that all the program.
We're a kind of a kind of prediction, collapse, collapse from all social signs and from all the city, it's free, and all of the cost of what we do is, and all of what we do.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else.
The city came up and he was came up and he said, and he said that I had told me that I had to have to be a huge, and he had to be a huge.
And I thought, "Comes, right?
A richeral antswer from food food of food, a piece of food, which is realized?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herererm."
Because this mal wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times. Times, Steve Lope, Lopezing Lope, and talked about it, and talked about the story of Green Round. They were reason for a member of Greengor, and we were able to change within change.
We hard the hands.
My strates like this, and he said that she said that she said they're underwards and love what we do.
So why should they do that?
LA.
They're best 6767 miles.
These are 20 Central Parks.
This is enough to powerful to powerful tomates.
Why wouldn't be able to find that?
And by a plant of a plant, you know, you know,000 sames.
With boards in the werts of a dollars in the werts of the werts of 75 dollars in the wert.
It's my home, I say, I say, I say that they should be able to build their own food.
His own food is like his own money is like his own money.
Look, I have a construction in South Central.
I'm going to look at it. I have my size.
And I know, part of this part of this before this part of this before the other people who were fabrically remote from other people, and I fabrically my own reality.
Look, I'm a coverage.
Garden work is my graffiti. I please my art.
Graffiti-k artists, the walls that change the walls, I beautiful, I'm going to beautiful plane.
I use the garden, the experience, like a piece of piece, and the pieces are my constructions for these cities.
They would be surprised what the Earth is that if you can use it as a line if you use it as a line.
They can't imagine how he can make a sunlume is a sunlume is, and how they're remote.
So what happened?
I've been remote, like my garden for the instrument for the result of my food and the result of my food.
To, to change the community of change, you have to change the collection of the board.
We're the board.
They would be wonderful as children are being conflict.
Garden is the therapistically, and coastic and coast, especially, especially with the city.
And then you know, you know, you know, you know,
I remember this mother, when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30, and I got out of my garden, and I got out of my garden.
I'm sent mean, because she was like, because they were there, and I said, "Wis don't have to do that.
The garden is not without the street."
I went to me, if I saw people who were looking at me, and I saw mean, and I was just asked me to do that, and people ask me, "Fin, you don't have any angry, you don't have any food."
And I said, "Thum teach, no, I don't know what they didn't know what they know.
And it's not to be on the street.
That's the idea.
I want to take it, but I want to take it back to the same time I want to take her health."
At a different time, I was a garden in this obddddim in Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow.
These are the guy who have been going to decided to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how its stories, and how they had to see how they've been able to see her grandmother and she was greater, and it was to see how it was changed for a moment.
Green reason has been so hard about 20 genaries.
To our environments, we got so 50 people, and they were all freed with all freedom and they're all freedom.
If you carbon, it's children, it's children.
When they turned to domata, they eata.
But if they don't get it to get it, if they don't get it, as it's not going to get the body and body eating them, they're blind them, whatever you're always looking at them.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work, but they want to work in this thing -- I see -- I see the thing that's exactly on the pads that are just on the pad, and the non-pading.
The gardens, I see when I looked like a building where we can train these kids can train their community to make their community to lead their lives.
And if we do that, who know who know who know?
We could take the next buildings, what we could do.
But if we don't change the collection of the Edboard, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plane. That's what I want to do.
I want to use a whole wanted to Garden, where people can be in the same flocks in the same flock.
I want to take schoolscontainer and they're going to take it into health.
So you don't understand me.
I don't talk about costless, because I don't know, because it's not after it's not behavior.
The communicate is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about working people, and children of the streets of the streets, and they're going to leave the streets and the eating, if you're going to leaderships, and if you look at the barmers.
So what I want to do is to do is to do.
I want to be able to all the ecological rebellious, Ganger, Ganger, Ganger.
We have to remove the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger.
Gangerous, you're going to take a sell, right?
And let's the waffected the waves.
When you want to make meet meeting me, you don't want to be involved me to make a meting and a meting, and some meting about where you want to do anything about it.
If you want to make meet meet you want to get your sell, in my garden, so we can do any single sound.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite slow in the entire oxford English World English Worlder."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No," is ineviticians."
Although in 19th century in 19th century a better definition, "It's a better definition is someone who is someone who is someone who is a youngotiating program or line, or line, or line, and his regularlying the regular power.
I don't have any idea what "speceral" is.
Something with World, I think.
But it's very important that words in the centrum of politicians, and all the politicians that they have to control.
For example, for example, the British parlament, the British Parlament, time not the words of the distribute.
And that was actually happening back to the mut of a man who was a man with the a management of a management of Brass Crosby, who was on the planet.
She was him in the Tower of London and talked him, but he was mutely enough to be enough enough to be enough enough to record, and he was so much difficult to be so much until the london, he won't won.
And just a few years later, we find the first night-foot for the first nights, like Brass." French.
Brasses areased on the English word for Blech.
But that's not true. It's going back to a return on a record.
But to show you how words and politics, and politics, I want to take you with the United States, as they're just going to take the unpendence.
You saw the question of questions about how to build the state of what the state of the state of the state.
You know, you didn't know.
How do you call the leadership of a republic nation?
And that's been in the Congress is long longer.
And there was all kinds of like this.
I mean, some people want to call him Gouvernments, and other suns, and other sunky, and other people, and other people who are recording to the freedom of the United States of America of America.
Nothing like a present.
Some people want to call him just king them.
They thought that was sixed.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to be the certain time for a certain time.
It would have work.
But everybody was incredibly unbelieved 3 weeks, because these data.
I have the days of a senators, who's stranged the story: "Immerically the same thing.
The reason for the reason and the longer and the longer was that the representation was the representation.
The representanted to be able to do that what happens is going to do. They don't want to be.
Can you call it, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be bringing.
They wanted to give them the most farmers, yes, yes, yes, the most farmers who give them after.
This title was "President"
President. They don't have the title. He didn't existed. But he was remembered that someone else has been used to be a vamination.
That's how the idea of a Jury.
He didn't have more reason as the reason, "And" or "Andpasser" or "Apasser" or "Apasser."
Sometimes, there was a little bit of little bits, and you know, and regularly regularly, but it was really an indeed title.
That's why the senates of the senat.
They said, "That's lowerful, you can't call it.
This closer to be able to record and fromlands and fromlands and fromlands.
Who gets him, if he's going to take a thumbs like President of the United States of America?
And also after 3 weeks, the senates of the senates.
Instead of the course, you know, the title of the title of the mind, but they wanted to understand that they wanted to make it away, but they didn't want to be able to do it.
You can learn about three things.
First -- and I've been in the best -- until now, I don't have anybody who's been able to find if the title of the title president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title of the title. He was just about it.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government said that something that something that was a temporary -- then you've got 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important point, is the most important point is that the title of the United States of America" is not so much more than the course of America" or not so much more like this.
This has been a little more than 5,000 nuclears of five, and the greatest volence, and the greatest volence of the world and a photograph of the world and this whole curious drop.
And what we've been given the title of the title of the title.
And so this is the senates on the end of the end.
They have a respectables title.
And the other sense of the sense of the research -- now well, so that was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to know how the classes, like the five limits with the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the senates and the representanted, because nobody's never felt that you're going to feel that you're going to feel that you're going to be the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take me and with the wrong.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality of reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, as a lot more than we could change the reality.
Thank you.

But I do it because I have to do because I have to low the building.
This is my favorite. Which is your face?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and seemed a less time I work as a model.
Second years ago, right?
I have the feeling that now is now in the space in the space, because I would have a uncomfortable launching this cool.
And I've been a little bit about something that I've got something for that.
This is the first time that you can see that someone's happy on the TED-Book, so you can see, so you can see that I think it's happy.
If you were really excited to be a couple of women, as I need to say that, I don't need to say that, I'm going to say.
I also say that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change the course, because I can change the 10 seconds.
And that's not everyone who hasn't chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good, it's good, I wanted to be able to track them.
The worst part of the most part of my head is about my head, because then you'll be able to get me out of my head, so you're allowed me to do that.
In ordination.
Why did I do this now?
That was possible.
Now, it wasn't hopefully like this image.
One is a massive, but a magage is also operating.
I've been changed your minds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been in reality.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photograph, I'm going to be able to my hand in the hand in Haare of this types of this guy.
And then, from operations or the false or the wrong brunch of two days, I've been very few massive to change our own possibilities, and our own possibilities -- even though it's impact on our own life -- and it's a big big change of life -- and it's a greathly un
It's like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
And I'm standing on this book because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this book because I'm a house, white woman, and in my branch, and in my branches.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh," but that means that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, a building in the genetic lottery and maybe you might be able to ask you, and maybe you're going to be a best.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have a beauty and young, and yesterday, and yetrically defined, we're biological programs, but also, as well as a big, but also hospital.
This is a result for me. And it's a recognize that's a number of me.
I know there are people in the audience that is in this point, and maybe some maybe some models, and maybe some models: "Halt. Naomi, Tyray. Joan Smalls. Luy.
And I'm going to comment your modelful modeless. S teaching.
But I have to tell you that I have to tell you that in 2007, a very large dotorand of the NYU.
The next question that I've always being, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm going to be a model?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my consciousness."
But the second answer that I want to girls that I want to girls, "Why?
Because you know what? You can be all be.
You can be president of the U.S. or the United States or the next Internet or a nine-Herzer, or a ninjorgD.
When they still think about this greater, "No, no, no, no, no, I want to say, "Well," I'm saying, "We're going to say, "We're going to say, "We's my camer."
Because I don't have a responsibility for the Chefrediction of American vogue or the American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;Me or the next six melism.
To say that you want to be a model that you want to say that you want to say that you want to say that you want to be a box.
You can't be able to control and it's not a career.
Now, I want to give you 10 years ago, I'm going to know, because of the other than history, because it can just be able to do it.
When you go back to a photograph, and that's just like a nice, and then you're going to say, "Cameron, we want to say, "Cameron," and then we want to go to the box, and then you're going to go back to the poor.
It's about this.
Hopefully more community than the middle.
That was .... I don't know what happens.
When you're looking at the school, and a few Jobs, and you can't have much more saying, you can't say that you can't say that you want to say that you want to be in the United States, but you want to go to be in life: "10 years," you're going to go to go to go to be able to be able to be able to
The next question that I'm going told me, "What's talking about all photos retuss?"
And yes, as quite all photos are retuse, but that's just a little part of the story of the story.
This is all the most photo, I didn't have the first time, and that was the first time I had a biciniode. I hadn't even even even even even even my piode.
I know that's going to be personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just looked at a few months from my grandmother.
This is what I'm on the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is what I'm on a pyjama-Party, a few days for the early for the early fancial vogue.
This is what I'm in the football and in the v-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's constructure and it's constructure of a group of profis, from Hawork, and Make-cake-known and photographs and stylists and stylists and structure that I'm not construction.
Okay, when you ask me, people ask me, "Creeks?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-cm-Abs, I can never trained, but the things I can travel, but the things I've been going to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it, and we don't like to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, and one day, I went to a laden, and I had a launch of my money for me.
When I found my friends with my friends with my friends, and they were talking about a redlective, and of course, we needed to be a reday, and of course, "It's just a high-consterronists, and we could further.
I have this cost of myself, I've got to go and not know, and not because my personality and there are people who are people who are not going to look at their personality and not because their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 parts of the last year, and I filtered in the last year, and last year, 85 percent of the latinos and latinos and latinos.
It live in New York, only 17,000 young, men and latinos, for the question, "What's not the question?"
So, "How do I'm going to go to the wanted to be able to do?"
And in my recher for these talks for these talks about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers, and these numbers.
The last question is, "How is it, how do you think about it?"
And I think they're going to believe this answer: "What you're going to be a little bit of harm and believe you feel very happy, and then you feel very happy and fabela."
And Backage we give a answer that maybe this early maybe this eventually.
We say, "It's really great, so much too much more recognize, with creative people inspiring people."
All that's true, but it's just one half of the story that we never say, because what we never say, "I've never been saying, "I feeling, I've never been saying, "I feeling me."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think about my exciting.
And if you ask you ask, "What I believe if I think if I'd believe you'd believe?"
And then you should have a few models, because they have the thinnerest box, because they've been the most cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cools, and they're going to understand ourselves.
When I wasn't a very difficult to make it very difficult to me very difficult, a real picture, because I felt a very uncomfortable, because I felt very uncomfortable, and I got to say, "I'm going to tell me, and I was going to say, "I was going to believe my felt." And I was just felt." And
It was very difficult, a very difficult, a result of until the biggest and rapidly often when I'm a greatest nutrative nutrative.
But I'm also happy and feeling me, and I've been here, and I've been finished that I've been here, and I've been here, or 30 years or 30 years or 30 years, and my career, and then I wouldn't be able to tell you about my careerms.
When you take out of this talk about this talk, then you hope that we all have the power of the power of the power of the powerful explains.
Thank you.
I've never been able told my grandmother nobody's never been in the exils of life, "Son," is, "Son,"
But who never never been like a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, it's been able to revolution of revolution of the side of the waves of the waves of the waves of the massive of the massive revolution.
I spent too much other libyers, in a lot of other libyer and extraordinary, to start a day of the corn and to start a revolution of the tyranning Guan Regime Gaffism.
And there was a great revolution.
Junge, liby women and men and men in the first regime, in the end of the regimes of the regimes of the freedom, and social general general general general general general general.
They have been example, they've been using to be able to remember the brutal Diatur Gaddafism.
They have a strong sense of sense, farmers, farmers, farmers, until the south.
After after a time, after a time of sexonths, and farms, and farmers, we've been able to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start.
But Gaddafi has a great big big big big big big boards, the guy who's the corruption and the reason.
Four decades, the four decades, the guyrannic regime sowboards, as the culture, as the moral structure of the lybical structure of the lybical society.
The challenge and the challenge and the challenge of challenge, I as many women, I as many other women who are recording to build available lybia, and we've been able to document and national equality.
So took 200 organizations were being in the case and unmitable to the case of the case of the case of Gaddazi, 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in Exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasmusiasmus, I started went to the top of the skills, human education, human education and fixings organization.
With a wonderful group of women, I women, I women, I women, a movement of women, a movement of women, fears of women, the corporation of life, and it's solutionary for the center of the women.
And in the election I met a very difficult environment, a very difficult to be a couple of polarism. At the Uman politics of the egoistics of Dominan Politics and explained.
I live a initiative of the Freezlands of women, and I'm a women, to reach a laws, a laws, and that every basically, each basically, and that's going to be care about the rights and country and country and country.
At the end of our initiative, and he was reflective.
Women women 175 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But long, but it's been reading the euphory of the whole number of the whole day, we watched the whole day, we watched by violence.
And one morning we went to the money of the money, and Suffering and Sufi-Gral Mozz.
And one of the other morning, we didn't think about the Mordord American bothers and the angriffs.
At the other morning, the experiences of opened the army of the arms.
And really, every day, we're looking at the milize of milize and their others and their own violence and their opportunities and their mission of regulations and laws.
Our society, we founded by a revolutionary violution, polarism, and polarized by the ideal and principles, social completely, social generality, social generality,
Intolerance, explained, and Raches were revolution of the Icones of the revolution.
I'm not today today today today with the experiences of our reversion of our revers and the choice.
For example, I'm here today, when we've been a nation that we've been able to make the wrong decisions.
We've been looking at our priorities.
Because the choice of wonderful stability or service or service in Lybia.
Hat the reversation is Lister and the white between the white between female and men female free-dime similary, and national various various various female?
No, it doesn't have it.
What's it?
Why is our society is our society and dominated by self-f-time politics of the dominance and the exception of Men wholedge?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been the only female, but the women who had the women of the middle of the grandman.
Our society needs a national dialog and covered a nationalogs, as they had the choice, which has just the choice and decision and decision and decision.
Our society needs to be the qualitative construction of the female, quantitative constitutions of the female of the female.
We have to stop in the name of the corning and a day of the river.
We have to start to figure out of the middle of the middle.
We have to develop a white developing, the following walls that wouldn't just too, but also together, but also, forth, forgether, collaboratton collaboratton collective constate.
These are the ideal that Ialthy boxed by wars, the warming lybia to reach free to free free free.
Because the Face has a alchemic and in this alchemically about the female of the female of the female sweets.
This is the years of the years.
And we have to existence we have to exist, before we're doing it sociopolitical.
After a variety of the Coran "Salam" -- Freeks, "It's the word of God."
The word "head" again, the in all the absolutely, and it's known as the same as the same as the word "srabical word "mbolism," and symbolized the windows of the whole personality of humanity, and the whole personality of humanity, and the whole personality
And just like the mother female of the embry, the embry, completely completely, it's the reason the whole exists of the entire existence.
That's why we said, "My Gnade, all of things."
That's why we said, "My Gnade," he said, "My."
And so we're going to be dangerous of the grandchildren.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, I thought the best of the world, and I went to bring the lower.
And I was very strong.
In school, we looked at the story of Kim Il-Sion, but we learned, but we learned about the world, except that America, South America, South America, and Japanese.
And even though I was often asked me how the eye is, I thought, I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until away.
And she looked for the first time, I saw a public head, but I thought my life in North Korea was never been in North Korea.
My family wasn't working, and I had to be a hunger.
But in 1995, my mother was a broad, with a brown, from the school.
Darin stood: "Well, you're going to be here, our families don't have more than that weeks because we don't have two weeks.
We love together on the bodies and our body are so difficult to be slow."
I was so hard.
I heard to hear the first time that people in my country in my country.
I went to the bottom on the bahnof and looked at something that I can't look at my experiences.
A lived woman woman on the board, and a above in their arm, and a hidden in their face in their face.
But no one of them, because all of them because all of them were so that allowed to care their families, and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a great hunger in North Korea.
At the end of the end of North Coreaner of the heart of the hunger of the open, and many more than they just reasons, because they just reasons, color and basically.
In the case, the half of the half, so that's been able to remove me all the lights of China, the light of China,
I asked me, why she was there, and we didn't have.
This is a satellites of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the Fluss Amrocraces, the philosa and China and China and China and China.
How you see, the river of the flow of the river, and he's very size of Northern Northern Coreanesearchers.
But many of them.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't say much about how I can left North Korea, but I can say that I can say that I can tell you that I could decided to China,
I thought I thought that I would be a course of my family.
I would have never thought that it was 14 years together together.
In China was very hard to live as a young girls without family.
I had no idea of how the life as a northern Coreanese flying his flyinger, but I would be extremely, I'm not just extremely extremely, but also, it's very hard. Becored in China.
So I lived in stronger in strongstant, and you could be able to fly in a bad, and you would be able to fly to North Korea.
One day, my greatest alptum was true as I was bigger than I was born, and in the police and in the police.
Somebody else me, North Koreanerinese, so they did my chinese career, and they asked my chinese questions.
I had this language, I thought my heart, I would explodate.
Would be anything about it, of course, I could be recognize, I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ab
I thought that was the end of my life, but I was able to control my life, but I was able to control my feeling questions.
After she was asked with the example, he said, "That was a false, a false.
It's not Norkore."
And she was like me. It was a wonderful.
Some north Koreanese cored in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had great happiness.
And even though they were finally finally, they were free, they were free international drucks international drucks.
This north Koreanerins didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, in China, in China, and after North Korea, and after North Korea, where they're going to be able to be able to be history.
While I was in my flyinger, I hadn't happinessed too much other northern North Korean.
It's tragically, North Koreaner, and hard to be able to remove the survival.
And she looked for a new language, and worked in a new language, can be in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the coverage of the coverage of the South Korea, and I started to go back to Southean life.
Micha in South Korea, was a greater challenge, when I had a great challenge when I had done.
English was in South Korea, so important that I had to learned my third language.
And I have the big difference between North and South Korea,
We're all core, but we've been very expective, we have very expective of 67 years of 67 years.
If I was an identity.
Bince I'm South or North Coreanerin?
Where are I going to come from?
Pluddenly, there was no land more, that my home, that my home.
Although I was the beginning of the south of the southern life, I had a plan.
I'm remember for the attack of the university.
And the idea of my new life, I had been a new life, I had a bad.
The north Koreanese body, the money I found my family, and when I was my family, and when I was approached by a family, and as a country.
They had to faster than possible as possible to plane.
North Koreaneran cored a uncredible streets back to their way.
It's almost impossible to the border and South Korea and South Aronically, Ironically to China and I was going to take a fly back to China and I was going to take away.
Because my family doesn't have to talk to them, I had to live them more than 2,000 miles through China and then southern Asia.
The business is a week, and weeks again, and we were fastic.
One time when the business was a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the extraordinary, and he started asking questions.
And I didn't have a chinese family, I thought, I thought they would be found.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided told him, and he said that she was telling him, and I would believe her, and I'm six.
He looked at me, but he looked at me, but happy to believe me.
We've been able to read it to read the limits, but I had to border all my money to borderships.
But even though we had the borders, my family had been able to illegal gorders, because illegal gordership.
After I had gone, and I had gone, and I had been family in a month, my family in a months, but course, my family, my family in the main city of Losa.
This was one of the greatest rid of my life.
I had all done to family to family to freek, and we were so name, but I was so name, but my family, just the south of the south of the southern Bothanic Bothan Bothanic Bothan Bothan Bothanish Bothanish Bothanish Bothan Bot
I went back and found out between the police and the police and the police, and I tried to try to family, but I hadn't enough money, but I didn't enough to make money or money or money or money.
I'm lost all my hope.
And so I asked the voice of a man who said, "What's los?"
I was found that it was a front of that a friends.
In Broken English and with a written with a words, I went to a went my situation and without a bank, and they went to a bankle for my family and two family, and two family to get out of the prison.
I thanked him from all the heart of the heart and asked me?"
"I don't help you," he didn't help you.
"I help the north Korean people."
Mir was that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The first thing that needs to come from Frembolismbolism for me to a new hope that needs to take the North Korean, and he showed me the friends and the fundamentality of friends and the difference international community of the northern Core.
If we finally reading our longer, my family, and I remember in South Korea, but the freedom.
Many North Koreanerans are being done by their families, and soon as they're going to come into a new country or not a money or not a money or not a money or not a money.
The International community can help us to help us to help us to help us to recognition and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the Auwitch, because many of us in contact with families, and we're hearing them information and we're going to change them information and money, and we're going to change the northern.
I had a lucky, so much hope and inspiration inspiration inspiration, I hope to explore the northern North Corean United States.
I'm sure you're much more excited to see a lot more excited on the world, also see on the world, also see on the book of TED.
Thank you.
I've just a bit of a bit.
Bitte you don't say that I'm not normal.
I want to tell you my bridge.
Remi is 22, big and very good, very good.
He can't talk about, but he can't communicated freedom, like some of the best reder.
Remi white is love.
He's particularly particularly, and he's expensive.
He's not just a bit. He doesn't have the skin.
He didn't know about religious differences and imagine, and imagine it's never been a light.
When he was looking at our childhood, when hearing about words, I'm not even remember, I remember, and how wonderful, and how wonderful, and how wonderful, and how wonderful.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a absolutely unfortable brain.
But he has a six.
He can't remember if he remember my schocola, but he's remember the publicly, but he was remember of every lower of every lower, he was four, as he was fourthing that we had fourthing the most fourth of my work on the left of the most part of my phone.
How do they don't believe?
But many people don't have a lot of people.
And in fact, because their construction of normal vision of Normal pasure, they're going to be able to understand it.
But what my heart, and my heart and my sea, and my sea, whether this was that the case was that the case, even though they were not just a similarly approached that they could only be authoristically, and eventually, extraordinary.
Now, for the people who are not solides that don't understand the reefuge <unk>Autism, it's a complex function of the brain of the brain, and sometimes the social communication, and sometimes the social farmunication.
It's the same thing about every individual, it's a different than Samium is different than Sam.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person Autism, and even though it's a snowest, and even though it's after the world, there's no one of the world, there's no current or home.
And I can't remember the first time when I remember, but I can't remember, but I can't remember.
I was just three years old, when my brother than my brother, and I was so on my life, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months ago, he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play how it didn't really being very interested in my babies, and actually not very interested in me.
Remially, and regulated in his own world, with his own world, and he founds, and he founds like the little founds like the little ding things like, Autosa in a radio in a radium of what it's going to be in a range of all the carry.
And when he was older, he was differently differently, and the difference.
But looking at the wood and the wood and the fun and the functivity was something really a really big hyperactive, a recently, a remarkable nature, a junny, a junk, a junk of human beings, who had never been a human being.
And it's a similar.
Now, I can't live that there was some of the only challenge of my family, moments, moments, I wished that they were like I wished to be exactly how I wished.
But I go back to the thought to the ding thing that they've been taught me, about individuality, communication and love that these things I don't want to be able to be able to do not to be able to kill the normality.
Normality about the beauty that beauty that the difference, and the fact that we're differently, and the fact that we're not going to be different from us.
It means that there's a different way of rich.
And if I just say a thing to Remi, and then you could say, and then you couldn't be normal.
You know, you know, you know, you know,
Because, autistic or not, the difference we have -- we have a story! We have a story of us, and in all of us have a story, and in all earlier, and in all the ultimative opened by Pocial Opocial.
The chance of the size, forts and walls in the moment, in the moment, in the moment, like someone else.
Bitte -- you don't say that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Docrified us with editor and neurons and neurons, with this photo on the photo on the project of a project of a project of a million seconds of seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million million million or a million or a million or a million or a million or a million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion.
I'm going to tell you a new kind of photography, the female photography, a new education that it's so fastics that they can recognition of lights in the movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the ability to build early, or without a rainforests or no beautiful body in our body, and really, really, and really, what we can do with my body.
When I'm going to take a laser and him in a billion seconds, and it's more female -- that's more female -- that's more female -- I'm a packethoron, and this is a packethorpe, and this is a packethor.
So if you take this project, this photones, and it's going to take this flashion and it's going to behind these photones in the flash?
How does light look like this?
So this whole events --
So think about it, the whole events are actually less than a nanosecond, more than a nosecond, and so light, so lighting this street, but I'm going to take this video to the video to the footpresent the footage of the light.
Noca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, in this film is very much, so much, so you can see what happens to show you what happens.
The puls, our project, our project, in the average with a photonespaketics, and it's starting to move and the bright.
A part of the lights, after the table on the table, and you see this experiences.
Many of the photones of the potones of the last last last language and exploding in different directions.
How you can see, there's air, which is airpartment that in the flash.
Whiled, as well ask the waves on the table and white the reflexion of the reflexion of the reflexion of the end of the focussion of the focuss.
If you take a <unk>ucky project, and it's the same streets back to the video back to the video to the video to the factor 10 billion people, you know, how long you have to see the film?
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long-term -- from a long-m -- from a long project, normal project.
And how do it looks like a stillle photography?
You can see how these walls that table, the table, and the walls in the hand in the hands.
It's when you have a sense of a teach.
I'm going to look like this, as a photo males, you know, some female, but of course, of course, of course, of course, of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the lights, you're going to be able to see that, this is not going to be able to do that.
Why is that? Because the tomate is recording and the light in their lights and after seconds, and then it comes back to the skill.
So in future, if these female, if these femto-camera in your camera, it could be able to be able to be able to go into a soupermarket, and if you can go to a fear, and it's returning around.
So how did my team at MIT this camera?
So when you know, you know, if you know, if you're a photo with course, you have very important light, but we've got very light, but we're going to get a billion doorder than your citizens, so you can't get a good light.
So we're going to do this: We're going to show this project, this photones, millions, millions and showed it again, and they're going to show you very clever, and that gigabytes of data, and we've been talking about this free-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-
And we can take all these rohates and doing things that we can do things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can do it, but how would it be able to make a new soupercraft for a new souper surprising: to see eck?
The idea is that we're going to street up the door.
It's going to go back to the room, a part of it, a part of it, and it's going back to the door, and we could reflect this more simplicate these simplicate, and we could use these more simplices.
And that's not a Science fiction. We've been built.
Links you see our femto-kamera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to leave the citizens.
After our application in the "Nature Communication" was releason, it was created by Nature, and they have this animation.communication.
We're going to get these lights, and they're going to get the walls and they're going to be able to get the potones and some of the potones are going to be able to be able to record our first potones, and then the lights.
And because we have a camera, the so fast is -- our faster is -- our fastery has some capacity.
It has a very good time, and she can go to the world in Light, and it can go to the world.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door to the door, but also the most objects, but we don't know what the point of points.
Indeed a laser on a laser, we can see a roh-Boh-Boh-Breaking on the screen -- not really, but if we can see many of these images, and then we're trying together, and they're trying together, and they're trying together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit of doing this, we can see the laborator in Praxis to see the practice, we can build the collisions that can be recognize what we can see in the collection of the collective lights.
But the bubble of the blood and building is very, very, very, very hardly, which is really a why is really a way of scientists, now is now about female, now, because of course, a new female remainments of the next generation of medical definitation of medical definitation.
So, how we can do is a scientists, even a scientists, and it's a science, a artist, a artist of the ultravity of the ultravity of the data, and that all of these gabytes.
But it's happening here.
If you look at these waves are looking at the waves, you see that the waves of us, you can see that the waves.
The walls should be moving.
What happens?
It turns out that we've been able to fast in Light, because we've been able to see effects, and astonomy, and astonomy.
The relationships, in the events in the world, in the world, he's going to happen in the camera in the camera in the camera, so you can see the space of space and time we can create these change, we can create these change.
So if we should have to photography to recography or the experience of a new truthorities, or new data, we all have to do is since our experience, we all have data, and we allowed our ways.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many possibilities like our lives.
We don't do any nightful night, so many ways of the streets, so many ways, we're going to use this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and think about how things like Atle, snowing, snowing, snowing.
The projects from my questions, how much maybe my questions, how much might be my neighbors?
How can we listen more things, without us, without us?
How can we remember our expensions of the buildings and the country and the country?
And how can we make our hope for likely to live our houses, so that our community and trees our cities and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea selection is going to be reports of hundreds of years, the second hundreds of years, and trees, I'm slows, I'm slowed to a street, in the music.
I think every time, every time you ever never know, there's no one parade.
In this city of the city of the most beautiful buildings, but it's also the city of the city of the city of the city.
I'm going to be able to see this house, and I have a beautiful, I thought I could also change my life for always changed my life for always changed my life for always changed.
In 2009, I was a young people I loved very loved.
You've Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death. You know, and it was unexpected.
I've been talking about the death, and I've been talking about my life, and I needed to my life, and it needs to me to be able to me in life.
But it's hard to me, these sort of evidence every day.
It's easy to understand what's really important, and what really important.
With the help of older and new friends, I've been a side of the house of the house of the house of the house of the lucks, and I want to be slowing.
I wasn't sure what I was in the experiment, but I could be founded on the next day, the next day, and she was always walling.
I want to share some sentence of you who were written by the walls.
"Bevor I want to look at the piratterns, I want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be."
"Bevor I want to stand up, I want to stand up international datums."
"Bevor I want to look for millions, I want to singinging for millions."
"Bevor I want to look at a baump of pflants."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netting."
"Bevor I want to look at it, I want to go to my arms."
"Bevor I want to be sterpect someone.
"Bevor I want to be sure I want to be a very slightly."
This is a laughter place, and it was a sense of place, and the hope and trees me to the people needed me to lead me to the wine, and the wine, and I'm slightly hope.
It's about it is that you don't know anything.
It's about our neighbors and understanding our neighborhood and watching and way.
It's about platients for best and for the news and to remember what we're going to remember what we're going to change what we're going to change.
I've been done this last year, and I've been hundreds of people who wanted to build a wall of their community, and so I wanted to build a wall, and I've got a basically change in the world, and now, and now, and now, like South Africa, like South Africa, and Isia,
We've been used to be as much powerful places, if we have the opportunity to experience our voice and more with other people.
Two of the most people that we have time, and the relationships and the relationships.
In a world with a world with two-bling conditions, it's important than ever, and the right thing with the right bubble, and think that life is that life is that life is that life is that life is course.
We're going to talk about the death, to talk about the death or also to think about it, but I have to think that the idea that the idea that the death is one of the death is one of the death is the most of us.
The thought about the death of death.
Our collective parents of the best parents, which is important than Individuals and more important. And with more important to teach our hope and stories can help us to share our hope to help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to be able to record mathematics. A particular problem for everyone who are constantly constantly mathematics, is that we're involved.
No one know what we do is doing.
So I'm going to tell you about today, today, to tell you what I do.
Tances is one of human activities.
We're decided by most of using the most popular ballettle, and soups, like you see how you see.
For ballettles a ballet of a big big massive maders and ability to capacity, and possibility, and possible events could have a genetic components.
Tradually, the first time, the neurological stories like Parkinson long-time center of my extraordinary family, and that's what I'm going to be a ballettuous ballettues.
And over the years, you have a lot of fundamental research in the mistake.
Trotting, there's a world,3 million people who have to be able to live with this disease, and they have to be increases like schools like schools, trees like symptoms, and more living the disease of the disease.
We have to have to be able to know if we can actually have to know if we can actually know if we can know if we really know if we have to know if we have a objective market, if we have a projective massive market.
<unk>rather is that there's no parkinson and other movements don't have a biomarker, so you can't just a simple biombs. That's the 20-minutes.
You have to be able to the clinics of clinics, and it's very expensive, and it's never been a half-sire studies.
But what if patients could do this test?
That would be a bit of tour in the hospital tours, what if patients, if patients?
It wouldn't be a teural thousands of hospital.
It costs <unk>100 percent of the neurological approaches in the neurological approach.
So I want to tell you a unkonventional Methodhode, with the methods that we're trying to get all the sense of the virtual senses like my records like my record.
This is a video of video of video of video.
This is what happens when someone is that if someone's going to believe our coord. We can look at our stimular ballettle, because we have to look at all these stimulate, because we have to build the coordinate, and we all have to build the game.
And as Balletting it's enormously a lot of surprising.
Think about how long a child, until it to talk to it.
And by the louds that we can use the vibrate vibrate stimulate chains. And as the sky, and as the stimularly of Parkinsones.
And on the example of the airplanation of example of uncomfortable voice,
We see this same symptoms.
It's coming to be swall, Steificity.
The language is going to live with the time and goes and it's an example of this.
This is the expectations of the voice, sometimes can be able to be able to be digital microphones and prison, and prison, combinated with news, combinated with new line, and we can do with news,
How can these tests with cleinical message? Well, they're not both of the test, and the test of the test.
They're nothing. The infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly. It's not going to be the voice of experts.
So you can be able to be able to be able to be.
They're very quickly, three seconds.
They're very billig and we know what this is called.
If something extremely, you can also be in big massive massive.
This is what we can do is we can do with this.
We can reduce logistic skills for patients.
Patients don't have to leaders in the clinics in the clinics.
We can do whether we can recognition through half of data.
We can make a few massive massive massive studies for clean studies and remained a difference of the whole population of the whole population.
We have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the biomarkers for the disease.
Today, we're going to do this room, we start start to start the parkinson's called "Initiative.
With Aculab and Patients LikeMeeeech, we want to take a very high-dime numbers to best enough to best enough to best enough to the exciting of these cells.
We have rooms that the dreams that are a billion people on this planet,
Everyone, or without Parkinson, can go to the air, to get a few couple of center to the center. I'm going to get fire with fruits, we've been able to be able to be able to be a realize of our centuries.
Thank you.
If you say, if you say 10,000 people call 10,000 people say, who say, who's not going to say who isn't it?
What's going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patient is that the patients have to be able to park if these parkinson's living or not. Okay.
Some of them may not be able to make it.
But we're looking at a huge data, under different environments, which is interesting. This is important. These are important, because we are important to make that are important to make the eventually, which are the real parkets.
Second, their 86 percent of their 86 percent of the skill?
It's much better.
My snower Thanasis -- I have to love him because he's been working on this work -- now has to be able to do that it's also working about the mobilitary, which is that it works, and we're going to believe that project.
That's what I call a connection.
This is called people -- the people can do -- people can do with the handyron, and people could do with Parkinson, their voice, their voice, so they can take their stimbress of the fear of the disease of the disease of the disease.
Goes.
Thank you. Max Last Last Last, my damen and Herrenren!
Thank you.
Here's why I live in Kenia, I live in Kenyairobi-National Park.
In the background is the coast, and the coast, and the coast, and the nairobi-National Park.
The Nairobi-National Park is just in the south of south, it means that we can use the words like covered that we can leave the park.
The rather, the solution that lions, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our variety.
This is one of our coast, which was afterward. I watched up and found it was great. It was a box. It was our box.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we believe that we're going together with our turns out of the handle of the hands.
I learned to learn to food.
Our war warrior, the Morans. They're decided our stamm and our hearts. They're equally reflease this problem.
And they killed the solution.
Here's one of six lions that were in Nairobiobiobiians.
And I think there's a nairobi-bobi-bobi-doms just so few lions.
In my stamm is a June between six years, and new years ago, and news for the coast, so it was also.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire idea was fire. Lions for fire.
But then I realized that we would help us to help us to see the solve the lions that are better.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to a vogel.
I wanted to think that the solution I wanted to students.
But solutions are very clear animals.
They're looking at the vogels and go back. Because they're going to go back and say, and they're always saying that's not yes, that's still not yes.
And they're just walking on and till our viety.
One night, I went to the stall. I love with a fack in the hand in the hand, and this time, and that's not going to be the larger.
Let's moving to be able to move.
I had a idea.
I was a little junker June, I worked all day in my cimmer and night, and I took the new Radio my mother Radio my mother. But I had took me. But I had a lot of electronics.
I took a old carbony and authority and a motorrad. The read. The left, whether you want to go to the left. He wants to be blind.
And I was a best words to me a shalter, and I'm a bit of a box.
This is a little birth of a birth of a captlamp.
And then I built all of these things.
The solarpanels that the battery, the battery, the battery, I call it the rest of the space. I call it a transformator.
And the risk of less blind.
You see that the birth of the birth of you're going to come out of you.
And so it looks like this for the solution when they come from the solution.
The light blink and the lights and the lions I believe that I was going to believe that I was the whole time in the bed.
Thank you.
I have this installed installed and since we didn't have a problems with lions.
And then our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
They had a lot of their animals and they found my animals and she found my faced me if I could found her light.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the light. They can see the lights in the background.
And so I've been able to give them in the neighborhood with the lights, and they work.
My idea is now going to be able to relationships, also for other radio, or Leoparden or Leoparopardens. The lights of farms of farms.
My experience to me to a stip with a stipending schools in Kenia, Brookhouse in Kenya, Brookhouse, and I'm really starting to be a really stuff.
My new school studying and hilters and hilts and hilts and recording.
I have my friends with my friends with home and grandmother and giving the light, where there are no light, and I'm going to show you how to do it.
I just a year, I just a junch of the Savanne, who was looking at his flying. I saw Flugucked me, "I'm going to look at me and said, "I'm going to sit."
And here's what I'm going to do.
I thought with a flight with a flight, for my first TEDTalk.
I'm a great, I'm going to be airplane, and pilot. That's my great trees.
From I have lions about my fear. But through my fear, but through my fear, I can return the covers and the solution, and we can go to Sid, side, side of the side, without the side, without the side.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I thank you very much.
You know, you know, you don't know how longer how you hear a story like your story.
So you're going to have this stipend. Yes.
You work on other electrical experiences.
What's the next thing?
My next experience, I worked on a electrical caunch. Alectric cauna?
Yes, I know, electrical cities are hard to have a long time, but I want to have my own own.
You've got it to be a time, it's trying to try to be trying to be trying to give it, but I'm trying to give it.
All of animal. Richard Turere, you're a little bit of something very basically.
We're going to be able to be able to focus on every friends.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm an old enough to half in the hand, is photography, photography my passion. But today, I want to share with you 15 my favorite, and no one of them.
There was no way of Director, no stranger, no chance to be a picture of a picture. Nothing. Nothing.
To being to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
My story begins when I started to a talk about a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, I was in my first buildings on my work on my arm. We were on my work on the Eckeep.
And then, we were looking back in New York and so we decided to be able to look at the same picture.
Well, you can see what you can see.
When the third birthday, my wife said, "Hey, why, why, why, why, why, why, and it makes a vather, and it makes a vathery to read the ritual forest?"
And then we started to make a picture of animals, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's notice, like universe is the universe is when you're a volunteera.
Nobody has ever been told young, and for the lucky is also never been able to do with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these risks of our lives.
This represently is very hard today.
This is only after the 11st century, and I had took the first time, and I had to make what happened to be able to understand what happened.
These images are much more than just a funny moment, or a certain represential represent.
They're also for us to be a week for us to change the octobers and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical but in all of us, not just physical but in all of us.
Because if we do this same picture, we're going to change our perspective of mal. While they're always seeing new miles, I'm always seeing it with their lives with their eyes, and how it looks like it.
These very intense, we spend together with each other, and every year we've been able to be free year.
Let means, while we were talking about one of our records, and we started talking about how they were able to stand how they showed them on a redge of a redleased on a redleased as a little bit of a smaller, in the small red.
And she was telling me about her feelings that they had been as a five-year-old, and that sort of these senses.
She said they remember how to remember the heart of the brust, as she was remember for the first time.
And now she looked in New York, because they want to study because they want to study in New York.
And I was slowly clear: The most important thing we all recognize what we all remembers.
And so I want to share with you to share with you, an active responsibility in the most expective results.
I don't know how it looks like this, but it's absolutely from this 15 images, I'm in a families.
I'm always the picture.
I want to come today everybody today with you today with the image and you don't want to ask youn't say, "What do you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
