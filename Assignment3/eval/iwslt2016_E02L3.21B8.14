When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the clenge of the clenge of the clen.
My father hard to his little bits, women who are the nights of the nights of the box.
He looked very happy, what he was very happy to be clearly until it was aftered by the nice.
He said, "The Taliban are half!"
I didn't know what that means is that my father, but it made my father, very happy.
"You can go on a right," he said, "You know," he said, "You know.
The morning I'm going to be never been able to do.
One of the right.
The Taliban, the might be in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I was both, and they were able to go back to school.
And so I five years, I five years ago, and I started took my older, and I started my older, not all of the more and more of all, nothing to go to a slime.
And so we could go back to school back to school.
Every day, we call a different way we could never be a different way that he could never be able to do.
We had our books, our books in Einkink, so we could go out of the income, as well, we just go to the book.
We were absolutely in a house, over 100 miles in a little winters.
In the winter was a huge, but in Sommer, but it was incredibly unbelieved.
We all know that we all know that our lives: Life: L teachers, teachers and our else.
In the until the until the until its a week, because the talible for a weeks, because the taliban being.
We were never been able to do how much they were all over us.
Do they were they going to do?
When they know where we do?
We had angest, but we wanted to go back to school.
I had great great greater in a family, in a family, and turned out when the picture.
My grandfather was his time.
One of approach of a decision of after after after after his test, my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and he was approached by his volence.
My mother models, but I was teacher.
That's what they're.
And two years ago, they went to the rowards to our house, just a house of our house and women and women.
And my father -- this was -- the first time, the first family, the most picture of the first thing.
For him, it was a children who would be a children would be a children, also would be a talible, talible, talible, talible.
He looked like a lot of great risks, not to be a lot of children, not to school.
I know that I know that I think that I was in the Taliban, sometimes, and even even thought of our lives, from our lives, and the perspective,
I was good lusted to be a lot of my father, but I said, "The's hearing me. You can hear.
No grands can be approach. You can be in the country.
But after a thing that's always going to be here, which is what we need to do with our bubble, and if we need to be able to do with our bothes, we need to do.
So -- you want to still you to still?"
Today I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, the year, the year, the country of the country.
Well, more than 6 percent of my alters have a highters, as a high-cond-cond-cond-cond-cond-course, and when my friends, I would have a women, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm going today here, as a state of the middle of the Middle College.
When I was after after I was my grandful, my grandfather, who was a family, because he was a terrible, because he was a greater, the first day, the first day, the first thing that was a biggest.
He didn't just not just with my high schools, but also the first woman who I was the first woman who was the first woman, and I was founded by the cars.
My family believe me.
I have great trees, but my family has been largery, but my family for me.
And so I'm a global bothers for 1010, a little bit of a women of women.
And so I've been going to go to the large, SOLA, and maybe a few internating in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country, and it's still still still still still stills.
It's wonderful as the shoots like the schools with my school with my schools with him, all of them all the chances.
And to see how their elents and varents, and they're going to see my else, and I decided my else, and all of all the walls.
So as Ahed. That's not really being name and I can't show you, but I can't show you a valuable.
And they were a months were his term and he was him to the home of SOLA in their drawing, and they're just a bombs of the streets.
When he was home, he was a telephone, and a collective and a stimeth, he would be fallowed him, he would try to be highter.
And then he said, "The said, "There, but if you want to be the future, but I'm not going to be able to set up my terms of older and older and efforts."
What I was aftered, so I've been doing something that I've been absolutely, the west often, the most of us, the most of us, the first thing that he's a value, and the water, and it's also be a valuable.
That's not a bit of our mother role of our mother role in our example,
These are they're highly highests that are possible for a lot of a lot of a lot of their terms of their terms of the society of the society of the society of the incomics.
Our the Taliban went to hundreds of hundreds of hundreds -- because it wasn't illegal.
Today, everybody in Afghanistanistanistan, three million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million
Afghanistan, from America, from America, but different.
The American countries like us, like us.
If I'm not change the changes are not from Dermins and reduce the United States.
But when I was in Afghanistan, when I'm approach in my school, and their parents, and their else, and they're going to do a lot of them, then I'm going to do a lot of walking a lot of walking a lot of wall.
Afghanistan is for me to me a country, and the university and the university, and it remembers, and he remembers that sounds.
And I think they have great trees.
Thank you very much.
And everything I do what I do is, my life -- my life -- my life -- I was brought about the working in Africa.
In 1971, I see in 1977 -- I've ever set up -- but I've been -- I've been in Sambia, the Elbia, and Somalia and Somalia, and Somalia, and Somalia, and Soman.
I've been working for a huge nRO, and every project, and every project that we're going to be able to the best.
I was sently.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people are good working in Africa, and I live in Africa.
Instead of all, we all of what we're all of what we're going to do.
Our first project, what my first project, what my first books, "Ripples inspiring," inspiring, a sambas, which is going to show the same thing that we want to show you.
We came withinalia South Adambia, in South Adambia, which is in this talmbia, which is a south of the South Abia. We're living a south of the talmany and terrible and terms.
Of course, the answer is not approaching in the interesting, so we're not going to do it for the work, and sometimes they're going to do it.
We were able to be able to be in a social talties, no landscape.
But instead of wondering why they didn't just say, "God, we just say, "Gottom," we're here!"
"Go," he's right now to remote the sambias,"
Of course, all of all wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, we had this practice, they were so big, they were so bigger.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Sambury," as skin, like skin."
When the tomets, and the room, came out about 200 Nots about 200 Nots and fly, and fraging all.
We said, "Oh," "Oh God, the Nilt,"
And they said, "Yes, we have no land, we don't have no land."
"Why didn't say, "I'm not going to be used used to us."
I thought we were just so much, we were so greated in Africa, but then I looked at what I do is what the American, what the English, what the early doctrates, what I did do do is what I do doing in our projects.
We five the nilters to the nilks.
They should see the university -- you should see the university, because we don't see the United States.
They should be the book of Dad Abamba Moya Moya Loy Moya Lio, it's a sambic science.
The book was 2009, 2009,
We have changed the African center of African center, 150 years ago,
I'm not going to tell you what this guy has this guy.
Let means you just want to be a book.
Let me from a African, what we have to do.
We're going to be imperialists, colonialists, missions, and there are two poories, like we're going to go to patrize them.
And the woman who are strong by the lather, "The's called "V"
But they have two different different businesses.
Patriarchalic: I love everyone, I love my children than my children, "I love my children."
Patronisism: I'm going to be a different culture, as a culture, they were my distron.
And so that's white people in Africa, Cheawa, Cheada, Cheada, Cheada, Cheada, Cheada, Cheaw.
I was aftered, when I was the book, "Smaller" which is approach of school. He said, he said, everything, if you want to leaders, if people don't want to leadership.
This is the first practice of the hilf of the hilf.
The first practice is Respeful is Respected.
Today, the horror, the histor who recently, the conference, a stab, and fraged a stability, "Can you don't know, not the new city is not the new city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to reactive people who are going to reaction and hearing a system that we never hearing something that you're going to be in a motivated, but you're going to be a motividdle of the distribution of the distribution of the distribution,
What you do -- you do -- you're doing the mouth.
You know, you never never memory with ideas with ideas with ideas with the idea of idea.
We don't work from Bros.
We're doing us in Cafor. We do do. We do in capitizens.
We don't have infrastructure.
We fly fundamental friends and find out what the person.
The most important is the people.
You can make someone each other idea.
When this person don't do this?
The person for the own windows of the person is the most important.
The pion for the own watch is the most important thing.
We help them to find the knowledge that knows can be able to find anything.
The person with the idea hasn't maybe not know it's not approach.
And many years ago, I had this one: Why didn't getting in a community and what they do?
Let me tell you a brain.
There are a problem with general problems.
Internet, never have been teached and they're going to say what they want to say what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they see.
Planation has this blind.
The cost people who are not going to be able to do not because they don't know, because they never create approach to do.
We worked to do this to do this to do this to do this, to do this, it's not going to be able to be existed.
One new basically, you have to be a new.
This is the house of the companies of the house of the house of the house of your house, your center and in the center and in the center, and in the center, and you can find your lives to find your life.
I've been inside, Westralia, trying to trying to do.
I've been trying to the time and trying to trying to be able to do what we do is what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had just walked through the first year, and I had three days, I half, and I him. He was him. He was him. I was him. I was him. I him a himself in a mountain.
I half of these fish fished to work and these wonderful, and that wonderful, not a friends in Albany for 60 center for 60s, but for Japanese for 15 dollars, "Cars."
In a year I had 27 percent of 27 percent. The government, "What do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I do you do something very, very, very, very swimple.
I half the mundreds and high them."
So -- -- -- "Mever," "Momen, you know, you know,"
We have the world, we've been able to 300 general.
We have 40,000 companies in the reason.
There are a new generation of companies that are going to understand the companies.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the best story of story, story with 966 years ago.
Peter pressure was Philosophy, he was a picture, he was business, and Petermany, Peter's a reality, Petermanity, and we're incoment and society."
Plances is the tod of the company of the company.
So you're going to know, without collecting what the cost of human collects with their money and their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to do this, you need to get this.
You have to help them to help them and practivity and practivity. You have to help them to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200,000 people get 200 cours.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the people?
For mean, the presentation of you have today, you know, right now?
<unk>ricularly, the economic people have applications.
I want to say that the company is that the right way of the right way.
We're the first of the first industrial revolution -- norrovolution -- numbers, fossilities, fully, and there's not after system, not after.
The recognition is not afterward is not after.
The Freon-Aron-tron is not after.
We need to look at how we have to look at the millions of people who are recognize, and we can use them, transports, transports, and they can corrime.
The technologies don't existence.
Who will be the technology for the green revolution? University?
The government? People.
It's going to be approach. And they're going to do it.
I leave a future in a future of a future of years ago.
There was a group of Exper experts that were able to related the future of New York City in 180s.
In 180, they were came up and speculated what happens in 100 years ago, which was happened in 100 years ago, the high school: The New York, the next to 100 years.
Why? You look at the curve and said, and they said, if the curve in this tempovation in this tempoids, they need to be six million perspective possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Because they went to the mistor.
180, they see the high technology that's the life of New York.
What happened? 40 years later, 1900, 1900, 19001, there was 100 carbonomics -- 1001.
The idea that I had a different technology, the rene of the room. It was a little bit of little fabies in the high school.
And then, Michazan. Henry Ford.
There are a brain, to work with university to work with university.
And when he had to be a distribution to be able to be able to be.
One of them, they don't talk to you and talk to you.
When you have to read them to be able to regular service and living invice.
And then you have to remind them the truthority of the universe.
Von the smaller to the largest firma, all of the largest things: The three things: The three products: The production, the production, and the power and the financial financial.
Rata?
We never have a few personal personal personal personal production, and we can make a production, and to create the same.
That's not existed.
These person was never been able to be a nobody.
We have foreign, and we've been the 100 iconic fishedomics -- Carnegy, women, West, Edge, Edison, edge, Google, Google, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle,
There's only a sense that allows all the world's just a sense of the world, just a couple of a person.
Now, we live 16-year-old in North America, and we started to start the first time, and we started to remote, and we started two side of Richardiography Araphy. The first 16-year-olds.
No, "The Mal and 32 mal "wir."
He wasn't all he started.
Nobody has a firmairs, noise. No. No.
So we can do a generate, in the past, in the parents that's a little parents, and you have a little hundreds, and bars, and bars, and what they're going to do for the guy, what they're going to do is going to talk about this guy.
What can you? Can you can do it?
Okay, you can use it? Can you're going to be able to the guy?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Mell, I don't like young you?"
We're going to be able to do.
We have grands of free-pexps that can be relative, and we're going to help them to help them, and people have to help them. We've got to help the wonderful, and we've hearing the intellecture of the brain.
Thank you.
I five years ago, I have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
The pennatients are battle -- a data -- a data -- an armunication -- in the communication in Communication.
I had angle --
Some of the students. Angine, and they don't have the great great great great big big big big greats, nothing me.
But as the laws of the law, he was like always like along as age, as a cover, and a citizens and a whole new world.
I felt I felt like I felt like I was going to feeling with the students. I was able to do that they had to be able to do that, and that other words, and that other words.
I think that tell you to do this tells us to do this treat career.
We need to change the big big crimation of us, and incientists and increasing the world.
Because our scientists and innovation are the largest problems that our great problems, like the energy, and when we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and then we don't know it't think about our economy. I love it.
But these great laws not come to come to understand our science and in their scientists, not in their wonderful.
So science and inside and inno, bits, clearly.
I want to show you a few of ants, how you can see it, how we can see that we can see that the science and the technology, and the technology, and they're talking about their oxyddday.
The first question that you have to be able to be able to be able to be, and?
Shay, why was a real economic science is so elevantage for us.
She doesn't just say that their trees, but also says that they say that their trees using their trees that they can be skills, because they can use the cover, because they can use it's important to understand the most important to understand.
And when you do that what you do is what you do, then you do, then you know,
Forests are a hindowerful, for the changes.
Some of her <unk>rumbs, and it's pretty quite, but why they don't say, "Ruma and time," and why is a lot of us?
Our thought Gedenermany is not the same thing like their name as their name.
How do you know, "My, "Momet's like this, but not just like this."
You can tell us to be able to know something about economic science, without a compromising without the compromising.
A few things are going to be able to building: examples, stories, stories and analogies.
And when you're working with their work, then you leaderships, and then you know.
Hab young young, why does it say, "Stompect"
What happened when someone else? All right? All right? All right now, and with these punchs, and they first punched their own public.
One of the following is not just a long time, but also too much too much in the brain of our brains, and we're going to be able to do.
These example of Genview of Genviews of Grove, we show you that the special structure that the trees are social structure of the Inspiration is so that they're so that they're a high-market.
The tick is a single thing that's a simple simple satters, and it's audience, if it's audience, if it can be approach, and the publics and our own publics, and our sense of the other skills.
These are just a few of ants that can help us to help us to see these types and the science and the science and the science and technology.
And so I've been story that I've been story, I've been able to do with the <unk>Ner," with me, I want to do with a same thing together with a same time.
So, the efforts of science and economics and embrace, and election, so that's what's important to say, and what's important, and what's important to be able to do with their economics. And society. And society.
So science and inside, if you're going to be able to be able to be able to be increase me.
Thank you very much.
Hi. That's my hand.
A hype can change a life and a personal free-free-free-free-free-fority.
Mity can be a hybread of humanity in Syria.
And a handy can be a nice can do a prototion and a protaction in <unk>pected.
And with a hype, you can take a lower, it's high schools and books.
All that's possible.
I'm a year, I'm live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the time in this stad.
And you can see how hundreds of people can change people in the countries of people who are streets and the streets.
We are in 1989, and we're going to be able to change these people who have changed to change the cell phone in the tasks.
Who did a hand, a hand?
Half you high.
Halt your hands, high, they high!
Half you high, a bubble, a bubberry, which is a black.
These are many. Fast everyone has a hell phone.
But now I want to talk about my hands and my life, and how it was my life.
And I'm going to talk about it.
This is 350,000 colleagues of information.
Rohone.
And why are these information?
Because in the Sommer 2006, the emission.
This room is called Right is Rightsual reline.
These runny best, every particularly in Europe, every particular in Europe, every internet internet, a bander, a bander, a bander of banderation.
Who does it? Who do you know? Who?
Who wrong a sMS?
And when you're a hype, where you're going to be.
All these information for months are going to be sex months to two years of your telephants or your Internet or your Internet or your Internet.
And over Europe, people are the people who have to say, "Thators," we want to say, "That's not going to be."
They said, we want to tell these idea of these idea.
We want to set up in the thought of time in the thought of time, and we don't want to be the telephants and information, and information about all these information.
There was aware, Journalists, Pralists, Pres, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "Thatists."
And here you can see how created people are streets of box of Berliness and said, "Free," and said, "Free."
And some of those who said, this could be able to state the stas.
The stas was the brain was the brain in Ostance in Ostance.
And I asked me, whether it really works.
Can you know, all these information?
Every time I mean when I mean?
So I asked my telephants that the distribute telephants that the great telephants that the great telephants in Dep, and I was founded to me, and I was able told me told me.
And I found them, and I wondered them, and they don't get a right now. Nurround. Nures Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to say this information because it's my life is the protocolleagues.
So I decided to do a guy, they wanted to make a service because I wanted to have this information.
But the distribute telephants, we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
At the end of a campaign with them.
I'm going to turn the ants, where they all allowed me to allow me.
Because in the fundamental relationships that the relationships that the emotion of the evention.
So I remember this halful environments with a center.
And on the CDD.
350 countries information.
And I saw it, and I said, and he said, it's half, it's huge.
But then I realized a way, I think that's my life.
These are sexonths my life in this date in this date.
So I was a little bit of what I think about what I should do with this?
Because you see where I'm going to be where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information, I want to go to the publicity.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show what people showed the idea of what means is means.
So without time with open and Open Data City, so I've been here.
This is a visualization of sexualization of my life.
You can recently recently and race you can go back and back back back and back back back and back back.
You can do any snow, I do do, I do do it.
And you can see how I can see from Franks with the flying of finally, and how many years ago, and how many of a lot of fully.
All that's possible information.
That's a little bit of a little bit.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just so I just like to talk about my woman and they talked me, and we talked to me, and we're going to talking about my woman with my woman with my woman.
And then I got a few friends and they running a couple of friends.
And after a way to a while you and you've got this room and we have this roometics.
But you can see how people can see the people communicate to communicate them to be a country, they're going to go to bed.
You can see all the things.
You know, you know, the central figure, about the figure of the groups area.
If you can see this information, you can see what the society.
If you can remind this information, you can relate the society.
This is a big countries like China and the Irana and the Iran.
This is the perfect effective economy, like a society of society, because you know, you know, because you know, you know, it's a possible, if you want to be able to do this.
And these information for months are going to be 6 months, in Europe to 26 years.
How I said, "I'm going to say that all these people in the streets in the streets in 1989898 hone in their hands.
And the stasped him, who would have been able to be the distration of the stration, and when the state, and when the state, then that maybe that maybe this is what happened.
The case of the best mountains might not have been stattle.
And also, not the case of the case of the evention.
Because we're stategories and firms of so many information, like they want to know how they want to know how they can do, and infline.
They want to change the possibility to understand our lives, and they want to be able to be long long long.
But even even even thought and a life and a life in your life, and a widerful time.
But everyone has to do for the same self-dime,
They have to do that every day, you have to do it.
So if you go to home home, you're going to be your friends of the 21st century, and that's not older.
If you go to home, you're going to say your eventually because it's just because the firms of sense, and they have to do it, but they have to do it.
And if you don't think you're not belief you're going to believe the Information, they've seen the information, they've seen.
So, in the future, every time you know, every mal, if you're going to remember your hands, you know that you're going to be able to get the same time.
Thank you.

These are 20 Central Parks.
This is enough fly enough to 75 million transparates to pances.
Why didn't want to find the tele?
And that's a panished a panel, you know, 10,000 sames.
Mituar boh in the wall of a dollars of a dollars and yourself in the window.
It's my hots, I say, I say that they should be able to build their own.
Some of your own money is how his own grandful grandful grandf.
South I've got a power in South Central.
I've been going to be there. I've my sense.
And I know, part of this part of this idea of this, and I was able to be able to be able to be able to be my own reality.
She's a counter.
Garden is my grandfi. I'm published my collect.
Grandi-kniti-kniti-knower, the wronger, I think, I think, I'm going to beautiful,
I use the garden, the garden, like a stage, and the piece of piece and the piece of these cities are my cities.
They're going to be able to what the expression of all, if you can use it as a country.
You can't imagine how he can't be a sunblumblum, and how they use people are books.
So what happened?
I've been able to a garden to a instrument for the results of my fources, and the results of my variolence.
To the community to change the collection of the collection of the box.
We're the box.
They would be wonderful, like children are going to be able to be able to be.
Germany is the therapy and cars, and carried, you can do, because you can do with the stad.
And you know, you know, you know, you know,
I remember this mother, when these mother and their terms, and their terms, it was after 10, and I was in my Gar, and I was going to be skin, and I went to be skin.
I'm going to be a bad, because they were able told them, and I said, "What you don't have to do that.
The Gargest is not not ohips on the street."
I went to me, if I looked at people who were sold me that I've been highly, and that's what I think it's not just asked me, "Fo, you don't want to be able to do you."
And I said, "I don't know, no, I don't know what they don't know what they know what they know what they know.
And it's not going to be able to the street.
That's the idea.
I want it to take it, but I want to take them to take her health."
And I was a different time I lived a garden in this obins in this own country.
These are the types that are going to decided to decided.
It was cool and they were technology and they're going to be able to see how they had to be able to see how they've been able to see how they've been able to see how they're going to see how they might be able to see a moment.
Green reason has been so hard about 20 general garan.
First of us, our environments, but they're going to do with 50 people and do that are all free free,
If you know, when children, it children, it's children.
When they were taking them, they were tomates.
But if they don't get its not going to get them, if they don't get them, as it's not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do what they're going to be able to do.
I see someone who want to work, but they want to work in this done, but they're looking at this distribute -- I see the pads, and they're going to go on the pad, and they're going to go.
The Gary I see a building when we can do this children, where we can use these children can create their communities to be after life.
And if we do that, who know?
We could use the next few years ago, what we could use.
But if we don't change the food of the experience, we're going to change.
So this is one of my parents. That's what I want to do.
I want to want to use a whole cocks, where people can use the same popularly in the same bock.
I want to take schools and they want to take them in health caful caf.
So you don't understand me.
I don't talk about cost of cost-load, because the costlos is not after.
The commonics is that you have to behavior.
I talked about this working to work and children, and children and children, and they're going to holds, and they're going to leaders, and when you learn to be able to read and if you look at the own publics.
So what I want to do here is that this is this here.
I want to say that we all all all of the same ways, Ganger, Ganger, Ganger, Ganger.
We need to be the image of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger.
Ganger you will be able to <unk>uck, right?
And so the windows the waiting.
If you want to do with me, you want to do me, if you don't want to do in the citizens and a methor and a method, where you want to do anything.
If you want to do with your brain, you want to get your garden, in my garden, and we can use any snow.
For. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite slowly in the oxford English World World Wargnoster.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snostergoster" means "by" is unexpected politics.
Obout the 19th century in 19th century, a better distinition, "In't a better snost-gost-gost-gost-shaps, and the approach of power, or approach, or a police, or a matter of the regramatter, or approach of the regramator
I don't have a similary, "speer."
I think, I think well, because I think I think.
But it's very important that we need to recognitics of politics, and all of politics that they're trying to conversation.
A 171, for example, the critical parents, the thirds, not the thirds, not enough the data.
And that's actually happened back to the mutes of a mouth of a mouth of named Crosssss, with the Parlament, with the Parlament.
They were able to him in the Tower and lones him, but he was a muthor, but he was a muthor, he was a lot often, and he had so much more until it was so much more until it.
And only a few years later, we find the first night years later, we find the first thing like Brassroom.
Brassroomss on the English World Work.
But that's not going to be. It's not going to be a reflection of presence.
But to show you how we're going to show you how we're going to take approach, I want to take you with the United States, when they're going to take the university.
You looked at the question of woman, what you should be able to build the state, the state,
You know, it doesn't know.
How do you take the an empublic nation?
And it was in the Congress in the congress.
And there were all of them all, there's all kinds of approach.
I mean, some people want to gounter what's called the Gouverton, and other setton, and other setton, and other books, and other people who are religiously of the United States of America.
Not so a present.
Some people want to be a nice certainly class.
They thought that's been during.
They were not months, they wanted to the cold for a best time.
It would have been working.
But everyone was unbridge, because this drawing, because these data, because these data.
I've been a sator, I've got the stuff, the still, "Immmerically,"
The reason for the reason and the long long long long longer, that the representation.
The representional challenge, what doesn't want to do. They don't want to be.
Can you never learning and himself, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
They wanted to him the most parent, young, youngest, you know, the most titledge of them.
This title Titels, "Prident."
President. They have the title. He didn't existed. But he was a certainly each other. But he was a vision.
And something like the idea of a jury.
He had no large, as the reason, "A" or "A" or "Apasser" or "Apasser"
Sometimes, there were a little bit of smaller, and regular general grandmonial generation, but it was a unbilitary tites.
And so that was living him to him.
They said, "That's last, you can't practice.
This countries have to be differently different and cities and out of course, and the citizens.
Who will take them to take a thumbs, if he's going to take a little tit of the visities of America?
And also after 3 weeks, not after the satense of the satense.
Instead of the course, you want to understand the title of the tites, but they want to understand that they want to cells that they were not approaching it, and they were not approaching their own.
You can see that three things are interesting things.
One -- and that's what I've been able to find out, but I don't have anyone who can be done in the sates of the title of psident.
Barack Obama, President Obama, because he was just a hitle. He was just a satively, that the satives is going to be affective.
Secondly, you can learned that if a regulation, that something that is something that you're going to be 22 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important punctice is that the tits of the United States of America," is not so that carry, or not even more than nothing?
This has been a more than 5,000 nuclears of nuclears, and the greatest volence of the world, and the world's a photographs and this whole collect.
And it's really history, and we've been distribution.
And so that has been a satense of the end of the end.
They have a respective titual title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of evidence -- so that was so.
But you know how many national national practent?
147.
Because they want to know how the classes, like the five,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the satense and the representially, because the represention, because it's never felt that you're going to be a seence of the president of the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take me and I'm going to take me.
Politics, trying to use the reality to relationships and the reality of the reality, but actually, but actually, but actually, in fact, but actually, the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came in a laster with a laster of 50 reveal campaigns to do a 19-year-old, fully, fully, fully, Flidavida.
I thought my half convers, I need a pairs, a pairs, and they need a paid and a rocket, and I couldn't see a room, I couldn't see if I couldn't see if I couldn't see a paid.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
Shong, I was a long time, I was biggest, all of the new physical pychanism and fix, and fix and fix and fix and fix-drowding settimply, and religious setton-drationalistics.
But that's the building of the same.
And so I'm going to be here, I've been after Afghane, South America, South Athe, and athechiest of God, and athechiest of the last color, and a new years ago.
So there's a lot of things that we could do things that you could do things that you couldn't do anything, but I want to do not a personality. I want to do the personality and I want to do the personality and relationships and repeating the research and repority.
I want to tell a day in life in life, I want to be a dangerous, the dominner of his doministribute, like <unk>Pops," and approach and religious biological color and religious corruption.
And what's sonsteriously can do for the present, as a parlament, and a choice and a choice, "Well, I'm going to do with the slog: I'm going to do."
And we try to use these campagues to use these mafiossible to decision as a national.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistanistan, and I want to go back to a project, "Rever," and you're going to be a falist, and you're going to be a falf of carbon, but in the carbon.
I want to look at me, like the conflicts in Afghanistanistanistan capture of my mathonic capacity.
The warm and the writing and the free-dime, and the campaign, a new environment, and Mode, you can do a new collection, you can do a model of a money, and I can do a money, and I can do a satters of the collection of collection.
And I would like to see how a simple simple schools between cabular cells, and we can make apply from 18989, and it's a distribution today that the development of the world, and they needed to be able to relationships.
But for all these things can come into the buildings, they can get missed, they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
But I didn't have to be because I need to be the building of the same.
That's my favorite?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Camer Rususson Rususussia, I'm working as a time.
Since 10 years ago.
I have the feel that now now now now here in Rumber of a uncompe, because I would have a uncompided to be able to do this care.
If I've been doing something that I've been doing something that.
This is the first time that he's the first time young males on the TED-B-D-D-D-D-dovery, so I think that I think.
Fall a few women, really he was really a few women, when I need to say, I don't want to say that I'm going to say.
I also asked that I'm going to be able to be able to change the course, because I can change the 10 seconds.
And that doesn't have any chance.
These are very unique are very uncomous, it's good, I don't want to do it.
The first part of the most part of my head is to coperate my coper, because you're going to be able to do anything you all of my head, so you can do that.
In organization.
Why did I have this now?
That was possible.
Now, it wasn't hopefully like this image.
One is a magning, but a idea is also opposite.
I've been going to be your memory of me to changed by 6 seconds.
And on this image -- I had never been in reality, I had a friends.
I felt very unfortunately, and the photographed me, I'm going to be able to my hands and I'm going to figure.
And then, from operation or the fal or the wrong, I was two days that I had two days, and there are very important to change our opportunities, and our own possibility, and our own possible, and our lives, and it's a bighly unfortunately, and it's apposs a big
For me to be able to be able today, today.
And I'm standing on this book because I'm a mod.
I'm going to stand up because I'm a high school, because I know, and I'm a branchieve that we called a sexy money.
I'm going to be the questions that people who are always still the people who are standing.
The first question is, "What's going to be a modle?"
I say, "Oh, I was decided, but that means nothing good.
The reason why I was a model that I was a building in the genetic less and maybe a important and maybe you might be a best, and maybe this best.
Now, in the last year, we have paids have been beauty, and youn't just healthymetrically, and you're going to be able to be able to be a high-grammatically, but also highly, and highly highly highly highly, and so highly highly hig
This is a result for me. And it's a result. And it's a result.
I know there are people in the audience, the publics, and maybe a few maybe a few maybe a few maybe, "Hey, Tali, Tr. No.
And I'm going to comment, I'm going to be your mod. Stell-dropression.
But I live to tell you that in 2007, that in 2007, a very highters, the NGOs all the number of the last year, and everyone who had a huge, and that was a single-four percent of 27 percent of 27 percent of 27 percent of the money.
The next question that I'm always going to be, "Can I'm going to be a modle, if I'm going to be?"
And I said, "I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, not in my prediction."
But the second answer that I want to be a little bit of these little bits, "Why?
Because you can be everything can be all.
You can be president of the United States or the next internet or the next internet or a nine-year-olds, which is what's going to be, and then what's the first thing you're going to be the first."
If you're going to tell this, "No, no, no, no, no, no mathon," I want to say, "Well," I say, "What I say, "What I say, "What I'm going to say, "Well,"
Because I don't have a consider and you couldn't have the carbon, or the American virtual or the stories or the next feet or the next money.
First, you're going to be a model that you want to say that you're going to say that you're going to be a jack of the line.
You can't be able to be able to be able to be careful and it's not a carriage.
Now, I want to tell you about 10 years ago, I want to know, because the science of known as a herful than history, but it's just going to be able to decided.
If you look at a photograph, and that's just like a netrow, and the college, and the camer, "Camer," and then we want to be a photo, and then you're going to go to the poor, and then you go to the poor.
It's what it looks like this.
Hopefully communically than the middle.
That wasn't know what happened.
If you're going to be a life and a life, and a few years, and you can't be a lot of you can't say that you can say that you say, if you want to be a lot of the United States, but you want to be in the United States, "Mod."
The next question that I said, "What's going to talk, "What's all the photossible?"
And yes, so it's all the photos are returned to be a little part of the story of the story.
This is all the most fot photo, and that I was also the most of all the most most of the most mal, I had a bix, I hadn't even even even even even even even even my piode.
I know that's going to be a personal personally, but I was a young might be a young might be a young.
So I just looked at a few months of my grandmother.
And I'm a day of this shoting.
My friends, I had to start me.
And I'm a pychama-Party, a few day, a few day for the front of a single psychanic vogue.
And I'm a footh, and I'm a virtual.
And that's what I'm here.
And I hope you see that these bilders are not a bilder of me.
It's construction and it's construction of profession of Haveylists and meters and meters and mothers and cographs and all of their emotion and all of their education and the psype and the broduction.
Okay, when you're going to be the people who say, "Can you're going to be sense?"
Ja, I've been a lot of 20-covered 20-cup, I can never get the things that I can get the things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I was a day, and I had a launch, and I had a cambon, and you had the clear.
When I found my friends, I founded with my friends, and they were able to get a redlease, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, "EDo," and we could have a high-fterest.
I have this costs, I have to go to the idea of my experience and not know, and there's not going to be able to understand their personality and not beautiful personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers, the last year, and I filmed, and they were filmed by 85 percent of the last year and Latinos and most of the men.
It live in New York, only 17,000 young women, men and Latinos, for the question, "What are not going to be able to do?"
So, "Why do I'm going to be able to do? When I'm going to take?
And the recher of my research for these vortunately, 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of their body in the United States, and these numbers, and when they're going to be 17 percent.
The last question is, "What's a modle?
And I think they're going to believe these answer: "What you're going to be a little bit of harm and believe you, then you feel very happy and then you feel very happy and finish."
And Backage we're going to be a answer that maybe this eventually,
We say, "It's really a lot of relationship, and it's a creative, and it's a creative people."
And it's true, but it's just the half of story, because we never never say, "I've never saying, "I've never seence, I've been five me, "I've got me."
And I feel like to think about my expect, because I need to think about my experience.
And ask young, "What I think, "What I think if I think if I would have you want to be able to be able to be able to be?"
And then you should have a few models, because they've got the thought they've been the most personal harm and the most cools and the cools and the most extracts, and they're going to understand the most women.
When I wasn't do this virtual, he was very hard to me, a very hard, because I've been able to be a very uncomportable, and I'm very unfortunately, and I was going to say, "I'm going to be able to say, "I's what I was going to be able to be able to be able to be ab
It was very hardly, a very hard, a very highter, and repression of the biggest stories, when I'm a greater.
But I'm also happy and five me, and I've got to do it, and I've been able to do it, and I've been doing this, or 10 or 20 years or 20 years organized, and then I wouldn't be able to do that.
If you look at this vortraged with this virtual, we all all the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea and following.

When I was a little bit, I thought my country, and I went to the world, and I went to the lower.
And I was very strong.
In the schools we looked at the story of Cimpanation, but we don't learned about the world, but we don't have a lot of the world, America, South America and our footh.
Obout me, I wondered how the eye, I thought I would have my whole life, I would have my whole life in North Asia, to a little bit of all time.
And they were sentence I went to the first time I thought, but I thought, but I thought my life in North Acorea.
My family was not arm, and I had to be able to live.
But in 1995, my mother was my mother, with a mother, from the college.
Darin standing, "Well, we're going to be able to be able to be more than weeks, because we don't have two weeks, because we don't have two weeks.
We love together and our body and our body are so hard together."
I was so hard.

Currently, I went to the both, and I saw something that I can't be a little bit more of my experience.
One less woman woman on the box, and a high school in their poor in their poor in their face.
But never half half because all of them, because all of them were able to care and their families, and their families.
Mitor of 1990s, there was a great hunger in North Corea.
At end more than a million norkancore, and a million northers, and many of the open, and many of the size, because they just size, and basically, and Brina.
Stromously, they were stilled to be afterwater, so it's been able to do all the lights, approach of China, the side of China, where we were in the other side of the side of the side of china.
I founded me, why they had been there, and we didn't have.
This is a satellital of North Korea and his nights.
This is the fluss, the Fluse, the teachers, the philosca and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China.
How can see the flow can be very size of the size of his north core, and he's a very size.
But many sort of survive.
Sometimes I saw people in the flow.
I can't tell you how I can tell North America, but I can say that I can say that I can decided to decision to change the change of change.
I thought I thought that I would be a currently, I would be a course of my family.
I would have never been able together that it was 14 years together.
In China was very hard, as a young months without family.
I had no idea of it, like the life as the life as a northern Coreanese fly, but I wouldn't just extremely, but I just didn't just extremely, but also extremely, but it's not going to be in the real time.
So I lived in stronger, I could be my wrong identity, and you could have a bad, and you would be after school, and you would be after after north.
One day, my greatest algready was a chinese police, when I was a chinese police and in Police and in Police.
And someone who was important to be a northern Corean, so they had my chinese chinese chines and tell me, and they're going to be uncomplished.
I had solve my hand, I thought my heart.
When I think somewhere increasingly, I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
I thought that the end of my life, but I wanted to considered my life, but I was able to consumption and reports.
After they were able to the excited, he said, "That was a camera was a falm.
It's not Norkaner."
And they love me. It was a wonderful.
Some norkanese are going to trying to change in China, but many of changes, but many of changes, but many of chinese police and relious.
These minute girls great.
Obout them, they were finally, they were fly finally finally free-groundational disease international disease.
These Norkaner, not so much lucky.
Every year, the cornia, in China, and afterware, and after Norkore, where they're going to be able to be able to be able to be history.
Obout my flow, I had a lot of my front of north corever, not so much more north core.
It's a core that North Coreancority and hard to make your identity and hard to care about the popularity.
And then they're going to have a new language and worked in a new world, can be in a moment in a moment in a moment.
After 10 years of the most of the most of the most of the south of South Ada, and I started to go back to the new life.
Michazore in Southernore, a great house, a great house, when I had a great house.
English was so important in South Ada, I had to learned my thirds.
And I've been the big difference between North and South Ada and South Ada.
We all cored, but we've all have a very expective, we've been very expecting from 67 years.
If I was a identity.
Binan I south or North Corean?
Where I'm going to do?
Pluddenly, there was no landing more than my himately,
Obout me the antswer to me the south of life, I had a panical life.
I'm going to be able to repress the university of the university.
Gerade me as I was a new life, I could have a new life, I was a bit of my news.
The norkanese Boreanese body, the money, I was my family, and when I was my family, and when I was a song-family, and when a country.
They had to be able to be able to fly asking her fly, so I started her fly.
North Coreaner, a uncredible streets back to their ways.
It's almost impossible between North and South Ada and South Aronically Ironically, I was after the way to China and I was going to take after the way.
Because my family not a chinese, I had to live them more than 2,000 miles, and then after 2,000 miles.
The business is a week, and weeks, and we were more fastic.
One of the business, a chamines, a chaminese police Police Police.
He took the extracts of all and began to start.
And I mean, no chines, I thought I would be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
When the chinese example of my family, I decided told him, and he said that they were doing it, and I would be since and I was since.
He looked at me, but he was happy, but believe me.
We went to the limited to leave it, but I had to fast everything I had to relationships to recontroles.
But even though we had the greened by the green, my family, my family, I think illegal Germany.
After I was money and schools and school, my family, my family, my family, but my family, but I was came back to my family, but in the high-time.
This was one of the greatest running my life.
I had all over my family to my family to free free-hamily, but I was sold, but my family, but my family, just the south of the sound.
I went back and I went back and the police and the police and the police and trying to try to be able to stranged my friends, but I hadn't enough to be able to turn it back to the money.
I'm sure all my hope.
And so I asked me the stimm of a men who is los?"
I was found that a free that a frequare of it.
Innglish English and with a woman and with a window, I was my situation and without a bank, and without a bank, and they were able to be a bank for my family and two family to get two north of the family.
I thank you very much of all of him and fraged him, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you to help you.
"I help the norkanese people."
Mird was a symbolically a symbolic moment in my life.
The free-creasing friends, and I needed a new hope for me to a new hope, and he needed to do that, and he needed to show me and show me to me and show me the fundamentality of the company, and the company.
If we found our learning reading my family, and I family, but I was just going to remote, but the free-down.
Many Norkan Euran core, and so they're going to be able to get them in a new country, they're not going to come with a new country, or not a money.
The International community can help us to help us to help us to help us, the education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Auca and the Aucont of us, because many of us, because we're hearing with our camilies, and we're going to change the information, and we're going to change the north of Northern Core.
I had so much lucky, so much hope and inspiration inspiration, I hope that I hopeful norks to relationships with international international international international international.
I'm sure you're going to be much more than the whole north coreds on the world, also seeing the world, but also seeing the books.
Thank you very much.
I just have a bit of a bit.
Bit me, I don't say that I'm not a normal.
I want to tell you my bridge.
Rememi is 22, and very good, and very good.
He can't talk about it, but he can't talking about a kind of a kind of a kind of the best rest of the best research.
Rememi, what Lieve is.
He's particularly, and he's exploying it.
He's not a high. He doesn't not on the house.
He doesn't care about religious unligious difference, and you just never just a line, he never several a line.
When he was a childhood, when hearing, I trying to be able to remember that I remember, he remembers, how we know, and how we know about how we know, and how we know, and how we need to know what the uncertain.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a sense of the brain.
But he has a selective.
He can't remember when he remember my school, but he's not remembers, but he remembers of every single lowered by my iPod, and he was able to be able to be able to be able to be a fourth of the poor.
How do they don't think about it?
But many people don't have a lot of people.
And in fact, because their possible vision of Normal personal personal pasure, they're going to be able to understand it.
But what my hermunters and my selection, and my selection was that if this wasn't being if they were not just as a similarly not just as a case, it could be auth, and they could be auth, and it was author.
Now, for the people who don't understand the same thing that doesn't do with the examplexism, it's a complex function of the brain, the brain, the brain, and the brains, and sometimes the body, and sometimes.
It's approach in every idea of identify, it's a different, but as sample, as samample.
And the world is going to be 20 minutes, in a new personalized autism, and even though it's a hardest, and even though, there's no laws, there's no laws or not a home or nothing.
And I can't remember the first time I'm not autism, but I can't remember, but I can't remember.
I was a huge three years old, when my brother, and I was so I was so I was so I was so I was a new words in my life.
And after a few months that he was differently different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play how it's not going to be able to be very interesting about it.
Remember and regulated in his own world, with his own world, with his own regules, and he founds like the small, like, like, like, like, and how to be able to regularly what it's going to be in the room, and what it's going to be in the rest.
And when he was a different, he was different and the difference, and the difference.
But the wood and the wood and the function and the rather of the nobody was a really a really big hyperative, a religious, and a rather, a junny, a junny, a human beings, a human being, who had never been a human.
And it's a similar.
Now, I can't live that it can't be a few momen in my family in my family, moments, I wished that I wished that they would be like I wished that they would be like.
But I'm going to go back to the disease, they're going to be able to do with your identity, and India, and Indmunication, and I think that this is not the same thing that I wouldn't want to do that.
Normality is the beauty of beauty that the difference, and the fact that we're not a good thing that we're not a falth, that's not a fal.
It means that there's a different kind of research.
And when I just a slow to Remi, and then you couldn't be able to tell you that you don't have to be normal.
You know, you know, you know, it's a huge.
Because, autistic or not the difference, we have a story, we have a story! We have a story of us, and in all of us, and in all the streets, and that's after the ulimative pative pative patients.
The chance of reason, Fortunity and walls in the moment, in the moment, and we try to be able to be a different.
Bit -- you don't say that I'm not a normal.
Thank you.
Docragon has been used with editially and neurosed with this photo on a project, with this photo on a project of a project of a million seconds of a million second million seconds.
But now 50 years later, we're going to see a million million million or a million or a million or a million or a million billion billion billion per seconds.
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography, the female, a new education, a new idea that it's so hard to be society is that time they can relationships in the light.
And so we can build cameras, the absolutely, the set of our skills or no personal education or no represent our body and in our body, and what we can do with myself, and what we can do with myself.
If I'm going to take a laster and himself in a billion seconds, and that's more female -- that's more female -- he's a packethor, and I think that's a pethilities, and that's a packethor.
So if you take this project, this potones, this potones and it's going to take these finish, how these pothones are going to be able to be able to be able to break?
How do it in time?
So this whole event --
So you think about it, the whole eventually, the whole eventually, as a nose-cond-cond light, but that's lighting this streets, but I need to recognize this video, but I can see this video, and you can see the right now.
Noca-Cola, this financed, this financed.
So, in this filmed, so much, so you can go to the solve me.
The Puls, our project, our project, which is a pothones with a pothonpetics, and that starts to be able to be able to be able to use.
One of the light of the lights on the table, and you see these experience and you see these excitation.
Many of the potones of potones the last last last potentials of the rivers of the research.
How can see, there's a large, which is a language, which is a language.
Whileds are breaking the winds on the table and the reflexion of the reflexion of the reflexion of the end of the end of the end of the focuss are focuss.
If you take a <unk>uy project, and it's going to take the same streets and the video to the video to the familiariarious market, how you know, how you want to see how to see here?
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
And that's a very long-m-m-m-m-year-old, normal projects involved in the movement.
And how do it looks like something stills?
They can see how these walls, the table, the table and the walls in the hundreds of the wall.
It's when you look at a since we're going to be a technology.
Miria, it would be so that the nature of the Nature, but a photo mal, but of course, but of course, of course, but of course, of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you're going to see that if you're going to think that if the lights, that if you're going to be able to be able to do.
Why is that? Because the tomate is the light, and that's after its after after seconds.
So in future, if these future, if these female in your camera, you could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to a surgery, and you can go to a crime, and it's received to be able to receive.
So how did my teamera, what does this camera?
So when you know, as a photographs, if you know, you know, you've got very important light, but we're going to be a lot of light, but well as a million doctor, so you can get a good billion dollars like you get a good light.
So we do that, we're going to do this project, this project, this pothones, and we're going to show you and show it and revers with very cleverty and this common, and we've been able to religate this common, and we've got to tell you that we've got to tell you to tell you to tell you that we
And we can take all these rots and do that, and we can do things.
So, Superman can fly.
Our cells can do that, but how do it with a new surgery, but how do you can see a new service: effects?
The idea is that we're going to start a light.
It's going to go back in the room, a part of it, a part of it will reflection back to the camera and we could reflect these more easy and we could repected these more easy.
And that's not science. We have so hard. We have so hard.
Links you see our female,
Hinter the wall is a pupproach and we're going to be able to leave the citizens.
After our evention in the "Nature Communication," was approached by Nature, it was from Nature, and they have been able to have these animation.
We're going to get these lights, and they're going to be able to get these walls and this potones, and that's going to be able to be able to be a few potential, and then we're going to be a bit of the light and then the light.
And because we have a camera, the so well, our faster -- our female, our faster.
They had a very good time, and they can go to the world, and they can go into the world.
And we know, of course, of course, but also the citizens, but also the most objects, but we don't know what we don't know, but we don't know what we don't heard.
India, we can see a laser, we can see a rock, we can see a rock, how they can see it -- how they see it -- but if we see a lot of these pictures, but then we can do so many of these bilders and trying together and trying together, and then they trying together, and then they're going to do it.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit often, we can see the lab, we can see the practice, we can use the collection, and we can use the collection, and what we can see, and what we can do is to do with the collective.
But the best of the blood and building is very, of course, of course, which is a really a way that's really a way to science, now is now, now is now after a new photography, a new business of the next generation of medical definitional medical definitional.
So, how we can do this, and the edge of science, it's a science, and that science, a cell photography, and I was a cell photography, and that's not just a data, and we know that all know, we know, not only know, we can't just know, but well be able to know, not just a c
But it happens here, it's something that happened.
If you look at this windows that we see that the windows you see that the windows you can see that the windows.
The walls to us to be able to remove us.
What happens?
It turns out that we're going to take that we're going to take a light, and we have affect, and a high-credible effects.
The records, in the evolved in the world, he's going to happen in the world in the camera in the camera, so you can decision, so you can decision and relationships, and we can do this consumer.
So if we should be able to reflective, or the experience, or the experience, or the medicine or new data, or new data, and we all have to do our data and all of our data and we've data.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many possibilities like our lives, our lives.
We don't do any non-frabed on the streets, so many ways, but we're going to be able to use this same public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public
In the last years, I tried to trying to my neighborhood and how things like things like things like to under the create and create and create.
The projects of my women from my women, how much memory, how much my numbers?
How can we live more things, without us, without us?
How can we relationships that we can use our experience and the country and the country?
And how can we go our hope for our hope for hope, so how our general business our beds and trees our business?
I live in New Orleans and I love next organans.
My seconds will be able to the right now, the hundreds of years ago, the hundreds of years, broughts and trees, I'm going to talk to a street. I'm always a street.
I think every time, every time, if someone nobody, there's a paraster a parade.
In this stranges of the beautiful buildings of the world, but they also also beautiful basically, most of most reason.
I've been able to be this house, and I have a beautiful, and I thought it can be a little bit of my life.
In 2009, I love someone who I love.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother, and she was a mother, and it was a mother.
I've been talking about the death, and I've talked about my life, and I needed to my life, and I needed to me, and I need to be the most important.
But it turns out, this sort of thing that similarly every day.
It's not sure, in the Alligence and to understand what really important.
Middle of older and new friends and new friends, I can be a side of the house of house, and I wrote a house, and I want to be slowed, "Bevator, I want to be a both, I want to be a joiness."
I wasn't sure what I could be able to experiment, but I could be smalled the next day, and they're always completely, and they're always still.
I want to tell you a few simple, the people who were able to the wall.
"Bevorite I want to start to be a pirlay, I want to be away."
"Bevorite I want to start with the International data, I want to trees."
"Bevorite I want to look for million people, I want to do for million people."
"Bevorite I want to look at a baumb."
"Bevorite I want to say, "nethod" I want to live."
"Bevorite I want to look at my poor, I want to half."
"Bevorite I want to be a young career, I want to be a cavior."
"Bevorite I want to be a whole thing I want to be myself."
This is a sense places to a sense of places, and the hope and the hope and trees mechaning me, and the laughters, and the window me, and I'm going to be hard time.
It's not about it, you don't know that you don't know.
It's about our news, our news and we're going to understand and reluss and relationships and way.
It's about platterns, and for best and for the news and remembers and what we're going to do is important, and we're going to change.
I've been doing this year, and I have hundreds of livings of people who want to behavior people who want to be a wanted to be a wanted to have a wanted to be a basically, and I've got a basically change, and I wanted to change the world, like South African.
We've been as much as much as many powerful public public public public public publics and more teachers.
Two of the most things that we have the most things that we have time, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever ever be important than young people who are going to thinking about the right thing to think that the life and it's a life and eportable.
We're going to talk about it, we're going to talk about the tod or also talking about it, but I've got to think that the idea that the idea that is a sense of the terms of us.
The Gedan thought about the tod of our life.
Our came to show you the best ples of what we can help us as India and as a gemories, and more important to help our opportunities, and more important to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I went to me with me with me, I'm a mathematics. All right now, a best problem for everyone, and that's what we're going to be able to be as well as well as well.
Nobody know what we do.
And so I'm going to talk today, I'm going to tell you what I do.
Tan, it's a human activities.
We're developed by most of most of most of most of most of most of most ballets and Stepen, like you see how you see.
For ballets a ballet of a biggest massive massive massive massive massive, and ability to be a big evention, and possible, and a genetically,
Tray removed, like Parkinsonic stops like Parkinson, these extraordinary family. It's also doing my join, and it was a time to be a time to be a time.
And the years of years, you have a lot of founds of founds in the mistake.
Trowded, there's a world, there's a million people who have to be able to live with this crime, and they need to be able to symptoms like the symptom, and more others, and we need to do that.
We need to be the research if we can do that, and last, and last, and last few maybe if there's a few market if we have a projective markets, that's what we can do.
<unk>ress is that it's a parkins, and other example, and other parks, so you can't just a simple biomby, so that's a biombs, which is 20-Minutes.
You have to be able to him with the clinics. It's very technology, and that's a very clean studies, and that's never going to be a nobody.
But what would be patients, if patients?
And that would be a bit of tours in Cranks in Cranks. What if patients, if patients?
It doesn't have a technology cranks.
It costs <unk>00 percent of 300 percent of neurological Abbological Abbbractic Abbia.
And so I want to tell you a unconventional Methode with the skills, we're trying to record. We all are all going to be in Snoved, like my virtual struggle.
Here you see a video of the video of video.
And that happens when someone, if someone who cancer, if someone can be done. We can stimular balls, because we can do all these stimets, because we have to build all these stimulate, we have to do, and we all have to do, and we allow the game.
And as Ballets, it's a lot of enormous.
Think about how long as a children, it's longer.
And so we can use the position of the position of the vibrate stimms. And so the Greema, and how the green, the stimets of Parkinson.
And the same thing that you can relationships can be a example of unclime stimulation.
We see this symptoms.
Strees, switch, Sife, Sife, Sife.
The language is going to live with the time and it's a example, and that's a example of it.
And this explorations can be able to the stimulation, but sometimes, but sometimes, but with thoughts and Prism and Prism and powerful, community, with new cells, and we can do with a very lawy.
How can these tests with cleinical memory? Nunn't be able to be able to be able to be able to neurogen.
They're going to be. The Infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly, and the stimes are not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
So you can change yourself, you can be remembers.
They're very hard, thought, you're very hours.
They're very billed and we know what the hott.
If you're extremely, you can also be in great memory.
And this is what we can do is now, we can now now.
We can reduce the logical skills for patients.
Patients have to reline in the clinics in the clinics.
We can tell if we can do with high-dovered by huge.
We can make massive massive massive massive studies for collection, and he's going to be a difference of the whole exploration.
We've got the possibility to biombs for the biombs to sick it.
Today we do the first step in this room, we started the parkets, we started the parkets.
Miducular and Patients, we want to take a very high-mo-covered stimulate choice, to take a very high-dimate, for the experience.
We have rooms that the dreams of a millions of a millions of people in this planet.
Every, or without Parkinson, can be a couple of parks, to record a few center to a few center. I'm going to get a center, we get to be able to do in our century.
Thank you.
If you say, if we say 10,000 people say, you can say, you can say, "I'm going to say, and who's not going to say, right?
What do you do with all these protect?
What happens is that the patients of the patients of the personal person, whether this parkets, or not. Okay.
Some of them maybe not going to be able to do it.
But we looked at a huge data, and they're interestingly differently, which is interesting what's important. And that's important, because we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to parks.
Second, their own graduced their own general community?
It's a lot better.
My schools -- I have to be able to be able to be so fantastic working -- but it's so fantastic works, but it's also going to be able to do what we're going to do is that projection, and we're going to be able to do.
That's what I call a connection.
That means, the people can do -- the people can do with the handyress and the test people can do with Parkinson, and they could take their stimps, so they can take their arts, so they can take the arress of the cress.
Go.
Thank you. Max Life, my disease, my disease!
Thank you.
Here I live. I live in Cenia, I live in Country,
In the hundreds of my vatters, and the couple of my vatter, and the couple of Nobal Park.
The Nairi-National Park is in the south of south of education. That means that we can use the wildren can be able to relative.
The riversity, the largest, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They're doing our violence.
This is a our counters that was aftered. I went to the morning and she was a bit, and it was a bit. It was a bit.
My stamm, the stammai, the massai, we think we're going together with our tests and the way we came together, and so much more distribute.
I went to learned largests.
Our career today. They're going to be able to students and our histories. They're going to be able to be able to do this problem.
and they did the largest.
Here's one of sexual lions that were created in Nairs.
And I think there's a national national national national Parkets, just so few larger solve.
In my stamm is a junny between the new years ago, and new years ago, and so that's what I was also.
I had to find a large.
My first idea was fire fully. Let's fire.
But then I wasn't really help used to help us to help us to help the corner, but the corner.
But I didn't doing. I didn't doing.
I had a second idea. I trying to do it with a vogel.
I wanted to say that the largest, I wanted to stay.
But largests are very clear.
They're going to see the virtual and go back and go back. It's going to come back and say, and they're not going to be, and that's not always still not still.
And they went to our violence our violence.
One night, I love the stall. I love with a fack. I love them to him and this green and this great creatures.
Let mechan for a light, that's what it's going to be.
I had a idea.
Son as a little junny, I worked the whole day in my covered and negotically, and negario, and I had a lot of my mother. But I had a lot of day. But I had a lot of electronics.
I took a carbony and author and a carry, and a motorrad. Derday, whether you want to go to the left.
And I'm a shal, to me a shalter, and I've got a bitch.
This is a little bird of a capture of a captlamp.
And then I think I'd all of these things.
The Solarpanels that battery, the battery, the battery, I call it a terromy. I call it a terrator.
And the relationships.
You see that the birth of the birth, because the color of you're going to get the largest.
And so they looked for the largest, if they come up.
The less blink and the left and the lossible, I was going to believe that I was the whole time I was the whole time.
Thank you.
I have this solve in home and we had no problems, and we didn't have a problem with largest.
And then our non-fraid our non-fraid.
One of them was this grandmother.
They had a lot of her terrorious losts and they found my fact, I could found my later.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the light. They can see the lights in the hundreds of the hundreds of the hundreds of the hundreds of the hundreds of the hundreds of the hinter.

And here I'm going to do.

There was no kind of distribute, no still not a chance, no chance, no chance, no malth. Nothing.
Of course, most of the most of used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ab
My story starting when I started to a vortraged in New York, and my woman, I made my daughters, and I was in my working on my artists, and we were able to 57 and 57 and 57, and 57.
And so we were a year, we were still back in New York and so we're going to be a same picture.
Well, you can see what you can see the house.
When the thirds of my day, my day, my woman said, "Hey, why didn't know why you're going to be after New York and it's a visual return to the risks?"
And then we found out of us, we're going to do a picture of us.
You know, it's afford, like universe, like universe is when you're a virtual free camera.
Nobody has ever ever never seen, and for the guy, and it's not never been able to do with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these reprisesent our lives.
This relationship is very hard today.
This is just after weeks against the 111. Septembers, and I had to go to what happened to do is that a fix-year-old.
These are more than just a lot more than only a lot more than a moment, or a best moment, or a best risk.
They're also for us to be a week for a weeks in the october of time, and how we changed our year, not only changed to change our physical, but not only in all of us.
Because if we do that, we do this same perspective, our perspective mality of militive miles, and they're always going to see how to see it with their life, and how they see it's like it.
These very, very inside of time we're going to be a little bit of time, and every year, and every year.
Let means, while we were talking about a our relationship, and we're talking about how they're going to show them how they showed them on a room, they showed a room, they're going to be a little bit of a small.
And they remember of her feelings that they had been as a fix-olded-olded,
She said that they remember how their hearts to the history of the brustrating a new years ago, when they saw the first time.
And now they looked in New York Corks, because they want to be unbed in New York.
And I was slowly clear: The most important thing we all all all of what we all all do.
And so I want to tell you with you with you, a colleagues in the effective riversity of expensive results.
I don't know how it looks like you see it, but I'm going to go from this 15 bilders, I'm a families.
I'm always the picture.
I want to tell you about you today today with young, and you don't get someone, "What do young, "What do you do a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
