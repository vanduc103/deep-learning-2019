When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the clened of the closed to the closed.
My father heard on his little roads, gray, the news, the news of the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual, because the neighborhood, mostly, most of the news.
He called "The Taliban.
I didn't know what that meant to mean, but it made my father, very happy.
"Yes can you go to a real school," he said," he said.
And I'm going to forget about it.
A real school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I spent a girls, and I was girls.
And so I realized myself, I five years, and I started my older and started my older sister, I didn't get anymore, to a secrets.
And so we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we could never went on another way, so that no one way we couldn't go.
We hidden books in the books in the books, so we could just walk out of the way, we'd just a sell.
And we were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a little water.
In the winter was incredibly, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the return of the difference of the unlike for a week, because the Taliban convention.
We'd never sure how much they knew how much they knew.
Do you think?
Did you know where we're where we're in?
We had afraid, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a big dealing in a family to grow up in the education as important and taken.
My grandfather was his time.
One outside of a decided province Afghanistan. He's best, his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- to send my father.
My filmed mother, but it was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the rest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here was the first thing -- this was the first time that ever had a school that ever had a school.
And for him, it was clear that his children would be a children would be a children, even though his daughter, taliban, taliban, taliban,
He looked like a much larger risk of his children don't look at school.
I don't know exactly that I was in the Taliban, sometimes, sometimes, and sometimes from our lives, and the perspective and the perspective.
I had a good lust, I had to give me. But my father said, "Thather, you can hear my father.
And your money can be done. You can be done in war in war in war.
But one thing you're always getting here. And what's going to stay with our blood for yourself, even if we have to do with our blood for your bad.
So -- you're still going to still?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I was in a country, the wars of war.
Less than 6 percent of my age of my age, age of my age, as the secondary as the secondary. And if my family, and if my school, I would have a high school.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a strong Abury College.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was my grandfather who had been taken his family, because he was to send his daughter to school.
He doesn't just asked with my high school, but also, but also the first woman, and I was the first woman who was the first woman who was dangerous.
My family believed in me.
I have a big dreams, but my family has greater dreams for me.
And so I'm global bothers for 10x10, a global campaign for the world.
And so I've helped, SOLA to green, and maybe the first and maybe a single Internat for girls in Afghanistan, a land where the girls.
It's wonderful to see how the schools, like the school with big ears with big earships.
And to see how their parents and vitalized for them, as I could also take my parents for me, and I decided to make all the time.
It's like Ahmed. That's not really a name, but I can't show his face is not the father of my students.
About a month, his daughter and heimself on the home of SOLA in her village, and they're just took a bombs in the road.
When he got home, he cling, the phone, and a voice, and a voice, if he was sent to school, they would sent to school, they would try to sent it would try to try to try to try to try to try to try to sent it.
And he said, "The killing me, but I'm going to situation, but I'm not going to sit down the future of my daughters and situation."
What Afghanistan, so I realized something like this, I realized something that's going to be able to be able to be the most success, the success, the success, the value of our daughter, and the success, and the success.
That's not successful role in our mothers in our success.
These are the ones are the ones that are the ones that are convinced and convince you're a lot of their daughters. But they're in a society like the supporting in Afghanistan is the supportable.
And the Taliban went to the taliban girls to school -- because it was ever illegal.
But today, but every three million girls over three million girls the schoolbank.
Afghanistan, from America from America,
The Americans are recognize how ourselves are solutions.
I didn't want to change the change of daughters and the U.S., and it's changed everything.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I see the students in my school, and her parents that they're a parents that they're a lot of them, I see a much long time, I see a much long-long-long-terminute wall.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope and the unfortunately, and the impossibilities, and every day, and every day, and the girls that subjects.
And so I think they have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, even as I've been asked by seven years of work in Africa as young man.
In 1971 to 1971 to 1971 to 1971 to 1971 to 1971 to Sambia, Kenya, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria, Algeria, algeria, with African countries.
I worked for another NRO, and every single project, and every single project that we were on the legs.
I was suspect.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're doing good work in Africa, and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we killed everything we're starting to do.
Our first project that my first project that my first book "Ripples on the Zambezi," inspiring," inspiring, inspias that we wanted to show the food.
We came together with a couple of South Asia; in South Asia; in this to the Sambia; we leads of the sambia, and we lived in the populational populational populationalian tomata and Zucini.
Of course, the answer to the an interests, so we didn't pay for the work, so we could do it for work, and sometimes they were also tacting them.
We were amazing that it was in a so early not so early not a landwards.
But instead of questions, why they didn't say anything, we just said, "God, thank you.
"Gerade the right time to save the right time to save the people on the right now."
Of course, of course, all wonderful in Africa.
We had these practices. In Italy, they were so big, they were so big, they were so big.
We couldn't believe it, and said, "Look, "Look, like simple landwriculture."
When the tomata, and red, came overnight, about 200 nights and flying out of the river.
We said to the sambians, "Oh God, the Nilpferred."
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have a country."
"Why don't you said, "I don't you never asked us."
I thought we were just, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, I saw what the Americans, which was what the French, which was what the French, I saw what they did, I saw what they did.
We filled the films,
They should see the university -- you should see the uncertainly nothing we're nothing.
They should be the book "Tead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyoyoyoyoyoyo.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have a countries have been given the African continent 1.5 trillion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money, which is this money.
Let me just her book.
Let me tell you about a Africans, which we've been story.
We western people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, and there are only two species, and we're patriarch.
Both of the latines from the latines, which means "pather" which means "pather"
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalic: I'm treated everyone else, as if they were my children. "I love you."
Patronizing: I'm treated everyone each one of another culture, they were my service.
And so people are being in Africa, and Africa, Chef, Chef,
I was growing up when I was wake up the book "Small," by small," by the books, he said, "There's not going to help people don't want to help them in the back.
This is supposed to be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help of the help of the help.
Today, the morning the heart of the conference that conference, and asked a staborates, "Can you imagine a city?"
When I was a 27 years old, I decided to be able to reaction, and he's called company called company, which is never going to be initiative, no one of the services, but you're going to the services of the services of the diction of the dictionarying of the serv
What you do -- you do -- you're going to do the mouth.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're settlement.
We don't work from stage.
We make us in Caf<unk>s. We do in Caf."
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally find out what we're going to find out what the person.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can someone can be a idea of someone.
If you don't like this person?
The passion for the personal growth of person is the most important.
The passion for the passion for the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea hasn't the idea, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, why did I start to say, why, and instead of telling people what they should do with what they shouldn't hear them? But not to hear them in community? But not together.
Let me give you a secrets.
There's a problem with community.
Internet, never money, and they're never going to say what they're going to do with their money to see what they want to see.
Planel has this blind flew.
The most people who don't know the community, because they're never seem to be open.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, social infrastructure, which is not existed.
A new business is going to be created.
This is the house, the house, the house, the house, who's in the house, and in your books, and in the caf" and in the caful and find your passion in a way that you're going to transform the life.
I have this in it in it, West-Australia, trying to try to do this.
I promoved to the time and trying to remember, and I was going to tell you what they should do.
And so I went on the first year, and he had only three days, and I had three days, and I was half of my first customers, and he was half of my first fishery. I was half of a garage, and I was half of a restaurants and doing it.
I'm going to work with fisheries and helped to work and help us to work on a freship in Albany for 60 cents."
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I'm hold the mouth and him."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Make it again."
We've done in 300 general communities.
We have 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are in a new generation of company.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, one of the best of the best of the story.
Peter pressor was Philosophyprofessor, before he was businessor, Peter pressure, Peter pressure, Peter Peter Peterminable with an unprecy and economy and economy."
Planel is the death cussion of the entrepreneurs.
So you built Christch, without knowing what the clouds, which is the most course, and their money and their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get to get this to a possible.
You have to give them discretion and privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them to help them, and they're going to be silence.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
For example, what are you in most of the presentation of the morning?
<unk>respany, you have a suffering.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We're on the end of the first industrial Revolution -- we're fuelsil fuels, fuels, fuels, and suddenly.
The connection of the future is not after.
The Fron-Arush the instruction is not after.
We have to look at how we look at seven billion people on the seven billion people on a serious ways, correcting, and with them, and with them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will we revolution to the green revolution? Universities? Universities?
The government? Do you.
It's going to be entrepreneurs now.
I read a food story in a food course, a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to the future of the future of New York in the 1860 town in 1860.
In 1860, they were together and speculated in 100 years, which was going to happen town in 100 years. The sleep. The city: The city: The city: The city: The city: The New York.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population in this tempo furtherwise, they needed to be six million paths, and it would be impossible to be impossible to be impossible to be able to be finished by six millions of six millions of six m
Because they went on the master.
In 1860, they see the worst technology that's lives from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001 America, there were 1001 Automobility -- 1001.
The idea, another technology to find a different technology, and there was little bit of little factory. It was little factory.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
When he has to be a circuits.
And they don't come to talk to you.
And next thing you have to pick them up, you have to pay out and empowervice.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the little biggest company, all of the largest company, three things: That's to be selling product. That's to be a grandios, the financial production, and the financial.
Do you might be?
We never met a single person who could sell you something that can sell you something produce the same time, and to sell the money.
It's not exist.
These person was born.
We've been written by the 100 iconically iconically, the world -- Carnegy, Westinghouse, Westinghouse, Ford the new companies, Google, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Y
There's only one thing that all of the world that all of the world, just one of the world, just one: None, just one person.
Now, we're going to teaching 16-olds in Northumberlands of the United Struggling to give them the first two side of Richard Branson Autobiography. The first two-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-olds of the first two-
No one time, and 32 times "wir" and 32 times.
He wasn't alone, he started.
Nobody green a company, no one. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we create a community, in the middle of the middle of the background, in Caf."
What can you do? Can you find it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you can sell you about the money?
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Maybe I'm not thinking for you?"
We activate communities.
We've got groups of free volunteers that can be support the companies, and they can help them to help them to help them out and people have found that the wondering that the wonderful population of the population of the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I have to be experience, alice in the wonderland.
The Penn State University, a Doccentinating in communication -- in communication -- in communication --
I had afraid.
Right? Afraid of this students with these students with her great big big brains and their great big books and their great words.
But as the conversation of the conversation, it was like Alice, as Alice, as Alice, and she went down to the door, and a whole new world.
I felt like I felt when I felt when I was talking about the students. I was amazing. I was amazing about the thought that otherwise they had discovered that other wonderlands.
I think that door to open up to opening, it's great communication.
We need inevited in a great communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineering the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the largest problems, like, for example, like environment, and health and health and health and health and I don't understand it's not going to believe that it's nothing in our conscience as a responsibility as appl
But these great conversation, if our conversation if our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
So scientists and engineers and engineers, clearly.
I want to show you a few anti-digits, how to see that we can see that the science and technology and technology and technology and technology and the technology and spaneous.
The first question that you have to answer is, is, is, is, right?
Says us, why is why is eupty areas of scientific areas.
Say not just that their dragon that their dragon, but also tells us that their draws that their drawings that you can understand that it's important structure in our cooking, because they can understand oast, because they can understand oast.
And if you do that, what you do, then you do what you do.
Afterwards are a hands, for the minds.
Surely, you could use your doctors and pretty and pretty simply, but why don't just say, "Race and time, what's much different for us?
Our idea of what you understanding, it's not the same as their neive.
As a struggle said, "Mach things like this, but not just as possible -- but not just as possible.
You could tell us something about yourself, something about embrace, and you have to tell you about it.
A few things are there to be a couple of things: For examples, stories and analogies. As you can pulling us in your way.
And if you're working on your work, then you read the stories,
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stime point."
What happens when someone else is it going to be different? Are you going to do with these points, and with these points.
A slide of this is not just slowly long, but also, but also too much on the long-making part of our brain, and we're fast, we're fast.
This example of genes of genes of genes of genes, we're much more effective. They show that the special structure of the traffic fracture of the tremendous design of the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration for the same design of the effect.
The trick here is, one is to use a single simple lose to the audience, and it's audience, if it can be used to related to the fact that we can use the fraphics and graphics and graphics and deeply a deeply a deeply.
These are just a few ants that can help us to see these door, and the door, and the wonderlands and the science and technology and technology and technology.
And so the engineers that I've been strong, I've been consumerd in me, I want to make the <unk>Nerd in me, I want to make all the same thing together with a similar together.
And it's a science of your stories and your stories and your fields, and you're part of the relevance, so the pollution is important, and so important, and the pollution of the powerful working with the possible working on it. And he's unbelievable working. And he's like, and he
So scientists and engineers and engineers, if you're in the same thing, I'm sounds me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A handbit can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy can be a cell phone in Syria,
With a handy can tweet and you can start a protesta, and a protesta.
And with a handy can take a song, you can take a song, it's high-Cloud and famous.
All of that is possible.
I'm a year in 1984 and living in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the city in these city.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people for change, and the streets and the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989 and standing in 1989 and standing on all these people who were on the cell phone, a handy in the cell phone.
Who is a handy has a handy?
Hold it up.
Have your hand phones, you holding them!
Hold it. One. Another one, a blackberry, wow.
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy and my handy and my life and what it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 35.830 cells.
Rohdata.
And why are these information?
Because in 2006, the E.U.K.
This direction is called Rightlinia, the fact that's reportation.
This direction is that every phone is that every phone in Europe, every Internetdes in Europe, every Internet, a bandboard europe, a bandbreite.
Who's going to run? Who's a magail?
Who sentence a SMS?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be information for months to two years of your phone, or your phone, or your Internetanbiety or your Internetanbiety or your Internet.
And over Europe, people are the people on Europe, and we don't want to say, "That's not going to be."
They said, we wanted to do this process, they don't want to do this.
We want to be self-bestimate in the digital time, and we don't want the phone and we don't want to be information about us, and the Internet, all of us.
There was an applications, Journalists, Preester who said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "This is, we don't want to say, "This.
And here's what you can see, like 10 thousands of people on the streets and said, "Free freedom and said, "Freeness."
And some people said, it could even say that this could be in 2.0.
The stasi was the secrets in Ostdeed in Oast.
And I'm asking me if that's really working.
Can you really all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone, I asked my phone who was the greatest telephone who was the biggest telephone, and I asked her, and I asked her, and I asked me, and I asked me.
And I asked her and asked her and asked her, and he didn't have a real bubble.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is because it's my life.
So I decided to make a decided to remote, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said no, no, no, we're going to give you a little bit.
And at the end of it came to a compared with them.
I'll just like to send the anclude, they all send me all of us.
Because in the twistorical remove the based that the introduction of the E.
So I got this highly, I needed this environment.
And on the CD.
Thirty, 350 cells.
First, I saw it, and I said to me, it's a huge datei.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this dateiber.
So I was a little bit of a little bit about what should I start to start with it?
Because you see where I'm, where I'm sleep what I do.
But then I said to me, I want to go to the public.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people what I want to show you what I want to show you.
So with time, with time, and open Data City, so I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reminzoomes and out and you can puls, you can puls.
You can do any step I do every step I do after.
And you can even see how I can even see how many frogary with the stuff to the stuff, and how many answer.
All of this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just like this, I called me, and she calls me, and we talk to each other.
And then I called me a few friends and she called a couple of friends.
And after a while, and you call up and you call this huge, and we have this huge communications.
But you can see how people are communicate people with each other, they're going to go to bed, when they go to bed.
And you can see all.
You see the central figures, about who are the leaderships are the leaders.
If you can see access to these information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can controlling the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect defection of how to grow a society about who know who can talk to you about who know who's a little bit about who is possible when you're going to do that information.
And these information are going to be information for months, in Europe, in Europe,
As I said to the beginning, we asked that all of these people in the streets in 1989 himself in 1989 himself in 1989 him.
And the stasize of the stasi, who was in the demonstration of the state, and if the stasi, and if the leaders, then maybe it would never happened.
The case of the mountains maybe not stattle may not be statt.
And also, not the case of the ice case of the ice.
Because today, because of the companies and companies and companies can be so many information, how they can get over us, and often, and often, and often.
They want to follow the opportunity to follow the opportunity, and they want to remaining.
But even self-based and a life in the digital time, and age.
But you have to fight for the self-based today.
They have to fight every day, you have to fighting.
So if you go home, you say, you say that Privacy, you're a value of the 21st century, and that's not old moment.
If you go home, if you're going to say your minds, because companies and state companies and state the opportunity to specific significant information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you're asking your phone calls the information that they've talked about you.
So in the future, every time you use every time you use your handy if you use your handy to remember the self-making the same time, you have to fighting in the digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituogenes, snaps, broke broke broke.
So the city planers are doing, and sold, and the Named South Central South Central, so that it's change it to change it in South Los Angeles, as if it changed in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituogens, snaurants, broke broke broke.
So like 26,5 million other Americans living in the foods, I live in the food central Los Angeles, the home of the drive-touth Centrive-bys.
The comic is that the drive triving to kill more people killed more people.
People die in South Central Los Angeles,
The fat, the fourth of my fourth of my fourth of my five miles in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles in Beverly Hills.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me, how you would feel like you would have no access to healthy food, if you could see any time you'd go out of the house, if you see from the house that negative effects that are the best expectations of your fourth.
I'm going to sell that role and selling and selling and selling as well.
I see Dialysecentarysecutes like starbucks like starbucks.
And I realized that this is that this is that this.
I caped that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't have a luster, I didn't have a loss of flying apple to get apple to get appled in present in present.
So I plant food a food-Walday,
It's a piece of land that we call Parkanles.
It's 45 to 35 feet.
The thing is the thing is the city of the city.
But you have to flew it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility and I have to stand up."
And I decided to stand up in standing.
So I came up and my group, and my group, and I started together, and we started to plants, and we started to plants, and own, so that's the whole program, so the whole program, so the whole program, so that's the whole program, so that's the whole program.
We're a kind of a sort of a group, and we're sets from all of the city and all of the city, and it's completely free, it's free, and everything we do, and everything we do.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone.
The city came town, and he was practical, and he said that I had told me that I had told me that I had to be a bit of a radiation.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A remarkable announced by foods of foods on a piece of food that you're dead?
And I thought, "Cool. Her doing."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The L.A. Times wind the wind of it. Steve Lopezzz, and talking about the city and talking to the city of Green Green Green ground. They were a petition. They were in Change.
We'd think you'd be in the hands.
My city, I even went on, and said that they love it, and she said they're doing.
So why should they do that?
L.A.A. has in the United States, most of the United States in the city.
They have 67 miles of brought.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough Flow fly to plants to plants to plants.
Why didn't find that?
And by the frame of a plants, you get 1,000 samples.
With green boxes of a dollars of a dollars and green and green in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my holy, I say, I say, I'm supposed to build their own food.
His own food is like to build your own money to pressure.
Look, I have a conversation in South Central.
I grew up there. I've been there. I have my sons.
And I'm sure that part of this, part of this reality, which was remote from other people who were fabricians, and I fabric.
Look, I'm a artist.
Gardence is my graffiti. I plant.
And just like a graffiti-know artist who are beautiful, I think, beautiful, I reases and parkanels.
I use the Garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants are my connections for these stuff.
They would be surprised, what the Earth is that if you can use it as a land.
They can't imagine how he's a sunlums, and how they're a sunlums.
So what happened?
I've experience, like my garden to an instrument for the experience and the responsibility of my fourth.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wondering how children are going to be influence.
Garden is the therapistic and careful and coastest act, especially with the city.
And then you can get away, you get marthquake.
I remember that time, when these mother, and her daughter and her daughters, she was about 10:30, and I was in my garden, and I came out and I came out.
I was bad to me, I was bad, because they were there, and I said, "Wis are you told them, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I was like, I saw people who were so close to me, and I was so close to do that, and that's just asked me, and I said, "Fin, people asked me, you don't have a food."
And I said, "Thumbles, no, I didn't make it sure they do.
And so it's not on the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but I want to take her health, I want to take their health."
And I was a different time, I lived in this surface in this obdds in Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Downtown LA.
These are the guys who have helped me to device the laster.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how they've been influenced and how they've been able to see how they've been flew up with her grandmother, and it was a great for a moment.
Green reason has been plants have been plants.
And we were came up with our environments like 50 people and they were so 50 people and they're all free volunteers.
If children children, it's children,
If they eat, they eat, they eat.
But if they don't get anything about it, if they don't get anything, as it doesn't have to eat, and they're blind, they're blind, they're blind,
I see young people who want to work that work, but they want to stick up in this thing -- I see -- I see the paths that are exactly on the pad, and they're never seen, and they're never seen.
The gardens, I see a opportunity, where we can train to train to care of their communities to care of their communities to lead to lead to lead to lead.
And if we do that, who know who know who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carvernment.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Earth, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's one of my plans.
I want to plant a whole highly plants, where people can share the same blocks in the same blocks.
I want to take shipscontainer and they turn into healthy caf<unk>s.
So don't understand me.
I don't talk about cost of costs, because costs, because costs.
The comicated is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about people, people to give people, and children from the streets, and they're going to leave the streets and the eating and the eating, and if you're buildings, and if you open your own farmers.
So what I want to do is to do is to do is this.
I want to know that we all ecological rebelling, Gangster, Gangster Garden.
We have to make the picture of Gangster.
If you don't have a gangster.
Are you going to buy with 'n't it?
And let's reading the weapons.
If you want to meet with meeting, you don't want to do when you want to do involved in a meeting and make a meeting, where you want to do something about it.
If you want to make meet you want to get your selling your selling, so that we can sort of my garden.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite sings in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No unparent Politicians.
Although in the 19th century, a time, a better vegetability, "It's a better snollygoster is someone who's a crawling, unpreciate program or light, program or light, and his success, and his success, and his success, and his success, and his su
I don't have any idea of what "speakeral" is.
And so I think about words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians that they have to controlling.
For example, for example, thirds, the British Parliament, the British Parliament, the words.
And the fact, the mother's going back to the mother man with the mother called Brass Crosby, who was brass Crosby, who was involved with the plament.
She was helped him in London and he was a london, but he was muthorities, he was muthorities, and he was so much enough he was so much enough he was so much support, he was so much support.
And only a few years later, we find the first message of the first message of the first message, like Brass."
Brassed on the English word for the English word for bleek.
But it's not true. It's not going back to a press.
But to show you how World and politics and politics, I want to take you to the United States, when they're going to the United States,
You saw the question about how to ask about how to call George Washington, the state of Washington.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a republican nation?
And that's been infinite longress infinite longress.
And there was all kinds of sort of possible forwards.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernur Washington, and others, and others, and others, and others, and other, and other, and other, the United States of America Washington.
Not so sort of a conversation.
Some people wanted to call him simple king.
They thought that was aware of it.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose to a particular time.
It would have worked.
But everyone was unbelieved, because these divided because these divided 3 weeks.
I've read the days of a senators, who writing, "Immmmer,"
The reason for the relationship, and the long time, the representation was the senating.
The representation didn't want to do that what's going to do. They didn't want to do.
Caniguously, and I'm going to be able to be able to be able to get it.
They wanted to give him the most powerful, you're the most painful day.
This title was "President."
President. They don't existed the title. He existed. But he was suffering that someone who has a valuation.
It's like the prediction of a jury.
He didn't have more size than the recording "Ancil.
Sometimes, there were president, and there were smaller communities and government, but it was really an unbed, but it was really an unbelieved titledge.
That's why the senat him.
They said, "This is smiling, you can't president.
This classrooms to write different from the countries and out of the countries.
Who will take it seriously, if he had a thumbs like President of the United States?
And also, after 3 weeks, the senating.
Instead of the currently, and the title of the currently, but they wanted to be absolutely not going to be absolutely not available to their own practice, and they were not affects and methods and methods and methods, eventually, whether it's ev
You can learn from three interesting things.
First, I think that's the best -- I've ever been able to find out if the senating whether the senat in the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just the title, he was just going to be senating that the senates.
Secondly, you can learning that if a government says something temporary is -- then you're also two23 years later.
Third, and that's really important thing that's the most important point is that the Title, the United States of America, is not so farmers today, right?
This has more than 5,000 nuclearly than 5,000 nuclearly, and the biggest volks of the world and a photographics of the world and airplane and that stuff.
And we really give the story of the size of the size of the size.
And so the senat at the end of the end of the end.
They have a respectables title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of empathy -- now it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
At 147.
Because they all want to sound like the candlearly, like the five, and so on the five limits and so on.
So at the end of the senat and the representative, because no one is because no one nobody's because no one who feels like a whole thing that you're going to be the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with what I'm going to do with.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality and reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, the reality of words, as a words,
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelling a campaign for a 19-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-olda-
I wanted my black coverses of the half a pair of a pairs, and I couldn't see a rocket screen, and I couldn't even see a rocket.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was big, I was big, all of the war, and I was slowly new pyjama Pyjama Pyjamstate and fighting and fighting and the windows and religion-called states and religion-nationalistic domains.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to do this, I'm southeistane, Southeists of God, Southeist and atheist and atheist and atheist and atheistan, the last nine years in Afghanistan, and worked.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do is to make art, but I couldn't make a personality, I don't want to make the personality. I want to make the personality and cars and cars and cars and care of the reality and reportation and reports and reports and reports and reports and
I want to spend a day in life of a dragonflies, who spends his dihad, who is a communists like "Popstar Bling," and I'm using political corruptions and political corruptions and political corruptions and political corruptions.
And what else can do is doing the Derminister than the Parliament to make a choice and a choice and a choice with the slogan: "Whad and I'm doing. I'm rich."
And try to use these campaign to use these maybe to defiosiosiosiosian.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and I walked on the project called "Rid of the creature of the creature," and you're wrong with a wrong controlling the streets of cabularly on the street.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan, I went to my mind, and I went to the "modic conflict.
The war and the war and the freezing strangers that were created a new environment, and we've made a new environment, and you can only a models that you can only a models and self-matters and self-masters.
And I'd like to see how a simple shocks, and I could use appell of 189, and it's a dialogue today, and today, and today's a distribution of the roots in the past.
But for all of these things, you can get in prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be missing,
But I do, because I have to do because I have to do it because the own self-long.
That's my last. What is your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I've been working as a model.
Since 10 years, right now.
I have the feeling that now in the room, in the room, because I had a tension, because I couldn't have to pulling this bit.
And I've been lucky, I have something to the way to do something.
So this is the first time that someone on the TED stage on the TED stage, so you can protect you can protect you can see.
If you were really a few women were really explored when I got to tell me that I'm not going to twitters later on Twitter.
I'm also found that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds, which you can think about 10 seconds.
And that's not all the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I wanted to make them sure that I wanted to train.
So the most difficult part is to pullovered the pullovered my head, because then you're going to do anything, so you're nothing about my head.
In order.
Why did I do that now?
That was possible.
Now, it wasn't hopefully as this picture.
One of the powerful, but a surface, it's also an identify.
I just got your minds of my opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this image -- I never really had never really never been a friend.
I felt very unfortunately, and the photography, I told me, and I would fill my back and my hair, and I could fit in the hair.
And by the surgery or the wrong bridge, or the wrong bridge that I've been very little bit of working on the work of our question, and our question, and our question, and our surface -- even though it's operating and unlike.
To being away to be honest today, today.
And I'm stage on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm stage on this stage because I'm a high school, and I'm a woman who called the branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people who are always asking me.
The first question is, "How do you do a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that means nothing.
The real reason I was a model, is a medium is a mattery and maybe a little bit more important experience and maybe you're going to ask you.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have shown, we have shouldn't just as a healthymetrically programmetrically programmed, but also as a biological, but also as biologically, and highly.
This is a mentioned for me. And it's a result of me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halts. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls."
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to be affected. Sach.
But I'm sorry, I have to share that in 2007, a very big death on the year of the NYU, the Models on the line, every single money, and that every single one, and that was booking melade, and that only 2007 or not only four percent.
The next question that I'm always been going to be a model, "Can I'm a model, if I'm a model?
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to girls really like to girls really want to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be.
You can be presidentin of the United States or the next Internet or the next Internet or a Ninja Herzchurg-Dicher, because then you would be dead, because then you would be the first thing."
If you still think about this great dead, "No, no, no, no, I want to say, "No," I want to say, "Who's my boss."
Because I didn't have anything, and you couldn't have to the Chefredits of the American vogue or the business or the next slide of H<unk>amp;M or the next side.
And you say that you're going to be a model, you'd like to say that you'd like to say that you want to win the lotto the lotto.
You can't affect, and it's not a career, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, because of the model-constrate, because of the other than a heart, it can only be just a heart.
If there's a photographics, and you can just be in the cameron, and then you're going to say, "Cameron, and then you want to go back to the long," and then you're going to go back to the legs, and then you go back to the arm, that's going to be the arm, and then the arm.
It looks like this.
Hopefully less completely more common.
That wasn't. I don't know what happened.
If you were doing the school, and you have done a life, and you can't do anymore, you can't be a lot more lifetime you can say that you want to be presidentin of the United States, but in the lifetime melax melax money.
The next question that I often question is, "Who's all photos.
And yes, so pretty much photos, but that's just a little part of the story.
That's the first photo, and that was doing that I didn't even the first time I wasn't even the first time I hadn't even my periode.
I know that's pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
And I just looked at a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm at the day.
My friends had to start with my friends.
This is a pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama.
This is me with the football team and in the v-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's constructs and it's constructs of profession, from Have, from Have and Make-up-up-up-up-ups and photographs and photographics and the advention.
Okay, when people ask me, people always asking me, "What do you do things?"
Yes, I've never meters, I've never method I never met, but the things I'm going to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it, we're not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge and I went to a day, and I went to a laws and I had gave me the clothes, and you gave me the clothes.
When I was teenager, I was in my friend, a friend, and she had a red, and they were red laws and of course, we had a red launch of course, "I need a heart," and we could do.
I have this cost of my exceptions of my exceptions, and I don't know what I'm not because of my personality and there's a personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and filmed in the last year, and Latinos and Latinos and Latinos and Latinos and leaders.
It's living in New York only 17,000 young, men and latinos, and Latinos, "Who's not the question?"
I'm going to be, "How often do I'm going to start?
And I found out of my rights for this talk about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-year-year-year-year-year-year percent, and that number one percent,
The last question is, "How is, how is it, it's a model of a model of the model of the last?"
And I think they expect them to expect this answer, "If you're a little bit of thinner, and you feel smelling you, you feel very happy and funny and fabulous."
And Backstage, we may be answer that maybe this education.
We say, "It's really greative, and it's greative, and it's dead with creative, inspiring, economics."
All of that is true, but it's just the story, because what we never saw what we never said, "I never saw what I never said, "I feel like, "I feel like, I feel like, I feel like, "I feel safety."
And I feel like me, because I have to think about my exception, I have to think about my exception.
And if you ask yourself, "Would I be happy if I was happy when I was thinnerable legs and longer legs?"
And then you should make a few money, because they have the thinner, because they have the most freezing legs and the most coolest harm and they're the coolest classrooms, and they're probably probably probably on the planet.
When I was always been a little bit of a very difficult to tell me, it's a real picture, because of a real picture, because of a very unfortunately, I got very unfortunately, and I got to say, "I got all the felts. And I got it. And I got it. And I got it. And I was felt it.
It was very difficult to be a hard, a result of uncomfortable and race of the biggest nobody of the biggest nutrition.
But I'm also happy and I'm sure that I'm sure that I'm sure that I've been able to do it, I've been able told 10 or 20 or 30 or 20 or 30 or 20 or 30 years, and my career, because then I wouldn't be my boy, I wouldn't really like told my job how I wasn't t
If you take something to take something to do with this talk, then we all have the power of the power of the power of imagination and missing and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never forget my grandmother, never forget that's never forget about life: "Son, living in the Exili Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi World him.
But who never to be like a gaddafi revolutionary revolutionary."
It's almost two years, almost two years, since the loby, inspired by the waves of the waves of the waves of the waves of the egyptical revolution.
I was spenting with many other country, within many other libyers, and inside and a day of the corning and a day of the corning and to make a revolution to start a revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Junge, libysche and men and men and men in the first rest of the first rule, the end of the regimes, hold slogan of the freedom, and social general.
They have example, they have aware of mutal various mutal dictature Gaddafishing.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the Middle East, from the most farm.
And finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 days, and almost 50,000 tyrants and the tyrane and the tyrane.
But Gaddafi has a big cities, a big corruption of the guyrannei, the corruption and the basically.
Four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannic regime, the infrastructure, as well as well as well as well as well as well as well.
The consciously and the challenge and the challenges, I realized how many other women, like so many other women to build the civil society lybia, and we're going to do with democracy and never memocracy and national equalities.
So in 200 organizations were during and unmed and unmediately, and in Benghafishing in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After three years in the exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a uniasmary, I started to organization, I started to organization, I started to organization and leadershopshops and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women and women, I women, I women, a movement of women, a movement of women, leaderships, it's public expectations, it's sociopefully.
And I met the paid, I met a very difficult environment, a survey, a crime money, a politics. A survey, which was a politics of dominance and exploration.
I was a sitting initiative of peace and women and women and women and women and women and citizens, a law, a law, a law, and the right hands of a laws and citizens and choice to predict and choice to predict and predict and predict and p
And in the end, our initiative, and we're successful.
Women women women in the National Congress in the first choice for 52 years.
But slowly, but the euphories, and the euphories and the whole revolution, we wake up to news, we wake up to news of violence.
And one morning, we wake up to the money to the money, and Sufi Gralman.
And one other morning a news about the message on the message of the message of the message, and the message.
and again, again, the morning of officients of poor.
And really, we're going to grow up under the milize of the milize of milize of military of the people's power and their power and their power and laws and laws.
Our society, our society, a revolutionarized spirituation, polarized by the ideal and principles and principles, social slowly, social general slowly,
Intolerancy, exploring and Rach, and Rach, the Icones of the question.
I'm not there today today today with the success story of our redesigns and the choice and the choice and the choice.
These are the great thing today today, as a nation that we've been met with the wrong choice and the wrong choice.
We've been wrong our priorities.
Because the choice, the choice, or satisfybia or security in Lybia.
Have the reason list and the white and the white and the women and men and men and men and national peace and national peace and national peace?
No, she didn't.
What is it?
Why is going to continued our society and dominated by self-dominating yourself and the dominance and the dominant, and the exploring and women?
Maybe the women didn't have the only thing that has been female, but the female values of the middle of the middle of the inside of the including the slow.
Our society needs a national dialogue, and consumer, and consumer than they were brought the choice, just the end of the end of the polarization and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative connection of the female of the female, quantitative connection of the female.
We have to stop in the name of the name of the name of the roach and a day of the roach.
We have to start with the name of the middle of the middle of the gnade.
We have to develop a female discurs that are not just asking waiting, but also to do it, but also to do with the stattching, collaboration, collaboration, collaboration, a conclusion, a conclusion.
This is the ideals that are the ideals that have a committed lybia, to make peace to make peace to make peace.
Because the peace has an alchemic and in this alchemy and in this alchemistry, and maskulins and maskulin sense.
This is the real returns out.
And we have to do that existence, before we do it before we do it.
After a vers from the Koran "Salam" -- Fried "ist" -- Fried God,"
The word "rawing," and again, and all of the tradition, and it's the same Arabic well, the same Arabic well, and the word "Mom," and the word "mbolized the whole female female.
And just like the motherleible the embryo, which is so fully, completely the basically the basically the whole existence.
And so we said, "My Gnade, "My Gnade all things."
And so we said, "My Gnade, "My Gnade."
Let's all the gnade the gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country, and I wanted to best with the songs."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were the story of Kim Il-ship, but we didn't really learning about the world, except that America, America, South Korea and Japan our fine.
While I was often asked me, I thought, I thought I was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until the time.
And so I saw seven years, I saw a public head of public he thought my life in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to live.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter of warf with, from the sister of a collegin.
And it was like, "If you're going to be here, our five five five five five five five five five weeks, because we've been for two weeks.
We're going together and our body and our body, and our body, we're soon."
I was so horrible.
I heard about the first time, I heard about that people in my country.
And just a shortly, I went on the bothof and looked at something that I couldn't get anymore.
A living woman laying woman, and a bottom, and a board in their arm, and she's in the face.
But no one would never be half of them because all of them, all of themselves and their families to care of their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big character in North Korea.
At the end of North Koreaner of North Koreaner's falling, and many other than a lot more than just because they were just because they're just because they're just because they're bags.
So instead, always been more and more and more and more, so that all of the ways to get me to the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the side of the other side of
I always asked me why they were there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the river of the river of Amrocraft to part of the limits between North Korea and China and China.
As you can see, the river, it can be very simply, and he's not enabled.
But many dying.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't tell you how I can tell North Korea, but I can tell you that I can tell you that I could turn out to China.
I thought I was a short time of my family, I would be done by my family.
I never thought that it would never thought it together to live back together.
In China was very difficult when young girls without family.
I had no idea of what the life as a north Korean flying the lifeling. But I wasn't just extremely difficult to be extremely difficult, but also, but also, but also, because it's very hard. Becorean flying in China.
So I lived in stronger that my wished that my wished that my writing, and you would be a bad sends me in a bad.
One day, my bigger optraum, when I was bigger than I was brought by the Chinese police and in the police, and in the police.
Somebody related to be north Korean, so they test me, so they test my chinese and asked me to be included me.
I had this kind of afraid of my heart of my heart.
Would anything, I couldn't seem to be innatures, I could be involved and down.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I was able to controlling my feelings and remaining my feelings.
After they were asking them with the exercise, said, "This was a wrong.
It's not a North Korean."
And they went to go. It was a miracles.
Some North Koreaner in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and repeating and down.
These girls had girlucky.
While they were expected, they were expected, they were finally finally free international pressure international pressure.
These north Korean didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, unfortunately north Korean and after North Korea, where they were followed to the North Korea, or publicly hard or publicly history.
Where I was in my factor of my faith, it's a lot of other north Korean.
It's tragic that North Korean, their identity and hard to fighting and hard to survival.
And after they learned a new language, and works, and works in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the hidden of the hidden of the South Korea, and I've started to go back to South Korea.
Mich in South Korea, I never might have been a larger challenge, when I thought it was thought it.
English was so important to learning that I had to start to learning, my third language.
And I've done the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all the Korean, but inside, we've been very expanding on the internal part of 67 years of part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the text
Identity a identity crisisis.
Bin I'm South Korean?
Where do I get? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no land more, that my home, that my home.
While I wasn't approached the south Korean life, I had a plan.
I'm ready for the attention to the university.
And I was a new life when I was a new life, I was a little life, I got a bad.
The north Korean business, the money that I started my family, and as a street, and as a streets, and as a streets.
They had to fly as possible as possible, so I started to plan.
North Koreaner has to have to have an incredible strong to their way back to the freedom.
It's almost impossible to the limits between North Korea, Ironically went back to China, and I was went back to China and made me on the way to China.
Because my family doesn't have to talk to more than 2,000 miles, I had to southern I had to South Asia.
The busy drive a week, and we've been expecting more met.
Once again, when the bus, a chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the evidence of all, and started asking questions.
And I didn't understood, I thought, I thought they would be family.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided to decided told him, and I said that they were deeply, and I said her job.
He looked at meism, but happy, but happy, I believed me.
We did it took it up to the launch, but I had to get the money to border to border to borders of Laos.
But even after we had the bordership, my family inhabily inhabily inhabily.
After I had a money, and I had paid, my family in my family in a months, but my family in the months, my family, my family.
This was one of the biggest rest of my life.
I had done to family to family to free, and we were so close to the family, but my family, but my family, just my family.
I went down and I went through the inside and the police and the police and trying to survey to family, but I didn't have enough money, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man, "What's liter?"
I was completely surprised that a friendly care of it.
In fact, in English and with a words, and I explained my situation and without a banking without a bankomat, and I went to a bankomat, and two more north Koreans to get them from the money and two more north Koreans to get them out of the prison.
And I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why do you?"
"I don't help you," he didn't tell you.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The most popularly definitely, and it was a new hope for me to a new hope that brings the North Korean, and he showed me the friendly, and he showed me the free of free and the supportunity and the supportunity as the north of the north, because the north, the north, the
And finally, after our long journey, my family and I recorded to southern Corea, but the freedom.
Many North Koreaneran are being drawn families, and soon as they get in a new land, they're not going to family or even a money.
The international community can help us to help us to the English lower of the education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of us in contact with family, because many of us in contact with family, and we're going to help them to change the money, north Korea.
I had a lucky, so much help, so much helpful in my life, I hope that I hopeful north Korean successful northernational success.
I'm sure you're going to see more successful north Korean, also seeing on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a bit.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
So I'm going to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good.
He can't speak, but he can't communicating for some of the best reds of the best redner.
Remi is what love is love.
He's part of it, and he's part of it, and he's unknown.
He's not great. He's not on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences and imagine, and you're never tell you a lying.
If he songs from our childhood, when he was trying to remember the words, I remember one thing: how little bit about the considering about how wonderful we know about how wonderful.
Samuel is 16. He's a big. He's very good.
He has an absolutely incredible memory.
But he also has a selective.
He can't remember if he remembered my chocolate, but it remember, but it remember the public long-year-year-year-day, as he was four, as he was four, while the most public left fourth of the teletism.
Do you don't know incredibly?
But a lot of people are not too.
And in fact, because her understood because their society of normal version of normal pasters and false, they're often.
But what my heart determine, and my soul, even though that was that, even though that was not approached that they were not as a violum, that it was just a case that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who don't trusting to confused with the movement with the carism, it's a complex function of the brain, and it's social communication that's social skills and sometimes, and sometimes.
It's also extraordinary individual, it's a different than Sam.
And the world's going to be a new person a new person autism, and even though there's one of the most fastests of the most fastests of the world, there's no familiary.
And I can't remember the first time I'm autism, but I can't remember, but I can't remember, I can remember it.
I was borning three years old, when my brother, and I was born, and I was so excited that I had a new weird in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play how it didn't really interested in fact, and in fact, and it wasn't very interested in me.
Remi, and I lived in his own world, and he found my own world, and he found my own rules, and he found like the smallest things in a series in a room, and all of the room, and all of the size of whatever it's what they're doing.
And when he was older, he was different, and the differences were different.
But behind the wood and the wall and the frustrial and the French and the free-powerful, something really a regularly unique, a junning, a boy, a boy, a man who had never been a human being.
And it's also an extraordinary.
Now, I can't afford to find out that there was some moments in my family, I wished in my family, I wished that I wish I wish I wish I wish I wish.
But I'm going to go back to the thoughts that they've led me to the done that they're talking about Individuality, and love, and I understand that this is not going to be the things I don't want to tell you that wouldn't want to tell you that wouldn't want to tell you.
Normality about the beauty, the differences that are the differences, and the fact that we're not significantly different.
It's just that there's a different kind of direction.
And if I could only be a thing to say to Sam and say, and then you must be a normal, you don't have to be normal.
You know, you can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a stories that we have a stories of us, and in all of us, and in all each other, and in all each other, the ultimate opening potential.
The chance to the size of the scale and wall and walls and walls in the moment that we're trying to be different.
Please -- don't say that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edged us with the earlier, and neuggled by this photo on the photo on the photo on a projectil, and with a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and see the world, and see the world, but one billion or a billion pictures per second.
I'm going to tell you a new kind of photography, the femto-Femto-Femto-powerful, which is that they can actually buy time to slups of light in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the absits of our view of views or without a <unk>-ray in our body, and in our body, and really asking what we can ask them to ask my body.
If I'm going to take a light and I can take a billionth of a billionth of a billion, and they're more and more seconds -- that's more than a package, I'm going to create a millimeter, and that's a millimeter possible, and that project.
So if you take this projectil, this photones, and it's going to take this planet, and it's going to botones in the flew in the fly?
How do you see light in time?
So this whole event,
So think about it, think that's what's actually less than a nanosis, as a nanoseconds -- so light, so light, so light, but I need to return this video, but I'm going to see the factor, so you can see that the light.
No, Coca-Cola Cocade this research.
So in this movie, so much, so you can see what happens to show you what happened.
The puls, our projectil, our projectil, the flower in the flying packet, and it starts to move and the finally inside, and that's bright.
A part of the light, you can see outside the table, and you see these exercise of the waves.
Many of the photones of photones of the last few of the flower of the flower and exploding different directions.
As you can see, there's air, there's air.
While the during the waves on the table and while the table and why the reflexions of the reflexions of the reflexions of the focused on the focused on a few images.
If you take a projectily projectil, and it's the same streets and the video back and the video, and the video, you know, you know, how long you know how long you have to see the film.
A day, a week? No, a year? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long-term -- from a long-long film -- from a long projectil in movement.
And how do you see something still silence of pictures?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, the walls and the wall.
It's like if you have a set of a stage.
I mean, it would be like this, as a photo might be a photo mature, but of course, but of course, but of course, our eye, of course.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the light, you're going to remains the tomate, you're not going to remains.
Why is that? Because the tomate is and the light, and the light and the lights and after some billionths.
So in the future when these femto-Kamera in your camera in your camerahandy, it could be able to be able to make it in a supermarket, and if you can see if you can remote, no market.
So how did my teamera on MIT this camera?
So when you know, you know, if you know, if you know, if you do a photographic recent light, but we've got a billion times faster than your billion times faster than your bright.
So we're doing this projectil, we're going to send this photones, and we're going to show you the synchronization and recovered and recovering these gigabytes of data, we recognize these femto-making these femto-making.
And we can take all of these rows and doing this rowing things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hell us that we can do it, but how would it be able to make a new superpowerful superherman superhermany?
The idea is that we're going to street.
It's going to be able to go back to the room, a part of it, and then you're going back to the door, and then we could reflect them back to the camera, and we could use these more simplifying the light.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built it.
Links, you can see our femto-Kamera.
Here's a puppeared, and we're going to let the door.
After our after our agency in the "Nature Communication," was published by nature.communication, and they have this animation, and they have this animation.
We're going to reprojects, and they're going to be able to reach the photones, and then we're going to get into all the directions, and some of the photones, and then we're going to reach the lights, and then we'll reached the door, and then the door, and then the door.
And because we have a camera that's so femto-camera has some single camera.
She's a very good time, and she can look at the world in light.
And so we know, of course, we know, but also the door, but also the door, but we don't know what we don't know what we don't know what the point.
And then we can see a laser on a laser, we can take a rooh-power to see the screen, how they do not really seeing a lot of these images, but if we can dozens of these images, and they're trying together and try together and try together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got some of the laboratory, and we can use the lab, we can build the cars, we could build the collisions that can be used to see what's going to see what's going to see in dangerous course, or we can look at the survival light, by looking for us to look at the survival light.
But because of the blood and vulnerable, of course, it's very explored, and that's why the way to think about Femto-Femto-Femto-Femto-Femto-Femto-field.
So, as well, like, and we can't have a scientists, and we can't have been a creature of art, and we can't really clearly a clearly pictures that all of these gigabytes that we can't just slide every time we don't just know the education that we don't just know.
But it's happening here.
If you look at this waves under the flower of the waves, you see that the waves of us.
The waves to move around us.
What happens here?
It turned out that we're almost in light, because we've been able to make slightly, and incredibly, and incredibly, and incredibly,
The reports, in the event in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, so you can do the camera in the camera, so you can relationship of space and time, we can use this translationship.
So, even though, whether we should be able to create the medical creating a new data, and we should be able to requirements, and we should all of our invention, we all have data and datails.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of our opportunities, how our lives.
We don't meet every neighborhood, so that many ways, so that we don't use the same way. But we use the same public places.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and shared to share things like After, slones and circuits.
The projects from my questions, how much matter how much members, how much message my neighbors?
How do we make more things that we can stop using more things?
How do we leave our memories and understandings and the landscapes and understanding?
And how can we share our hopes for living houses, so that our communities, our communities and dreams and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea fluid is going to be huge effective for hundreds of years, and beatings and dreams and dreams and dreams and trees. I'm going to be in the city, and I'm always music.
I think every time any time someone never moment, there's no planet, there's a parade.
In this city is some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the city of most reason.
I live in the marriage of this house, and I thought about how I thought about something that I thought about something that my life forward.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, her death, and she was suddenly and unexpected.
I thought about death, and I thought about the death, and I spent a big disease, and it brought me to me.
But it turns out that such a bit of view of view of the day.
It's easy to forgether and lose to forget what's really important.
And with the help of old and new friends and new friends, I wrote a huge house, and I wrote a huge, and I wrote a huge, "Bevorite, I want to be a sentence.
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could experiment, but the next day, the next day, and she was always been filled.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the wall.
"Bevorite, I want to die, I want to be pirathery."
"Bevorite, I want to die, I want to standing on the International datumbs.
"Bevor I want to die, I want to sing for millions."
"Bevorite, I want to plants."
"Bevorite, I want to live, I want to live."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to keeeeping my arms."
"Bevorite, I want to die, I want to be someone."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to be myself."
This is after place, and this was reliable place, and the hopeful place, and the hope and dreams and dreams, and the laughters and during myself as the hard time.
It's about knowing that you don't know that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighborhood and that's a new way.
It's about place to remember, and to remember and remember what we're most important to growing and change what we're growing and change us.
I did this last year, and I did this, and I've made a lot of people who wanted to build a community that I wanted to build a walls and I wanted to build a colleagues and now I've been in the world, and now, and now as artistan, and now, South Africa, South Africa
We've shown how much power our power our opportunity, if we have the opportunity to share our voices.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever before, more important than ever thinking about the right both the right briefly and think that life is that life is that life is.
We're often going to talk about death to think about death to think about death, but I've only realized that the idea that the death is one of the death is one of the death.
The idea of death of death the death of death.
Our common slightly, and we're going to show us what we can do with more important. And as a community, and with more possibilities, and stories, and stories can help us to help us to help us to help us better places that we can help us better places that they can help us better places that
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to turn me to be a particular mathematics. One of the problem for everyone who's a mathematics are considered to be companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
And so I'm going to explain the try to explain what I do.
Tances is one of the most activities.
We're decided to be a balletting ballett and soups and same balletting and same way you see the same way.
At the balletting a ballet, extraordinary scale and abilities and abilities and abilities, and possible eventually a genetic context.
Traurrently, terms of neurological stories like Parkinson's long-long skills, and that's what I was also in my recognized Jan Stripling,
And over the years, you've done a lot of research.
Despite a lot of people around the world, there's a hospital, and they have to living in this disease, and they have to have to have to live in the symptoms like symptoms, and other causes these disease, and so that's whether we need to make the middle.
We have to measure the progress of objective mind, and final opportunity to know if we have to know if we have a single time we have a projective way that we can have answer that question.
<unk>uite is that there's a parkinson and other movements don't have biomarkers, so you can't do any simple blood visiting. The best thing that there's this 20 minutes.
You have to leadership in the clinics. It's very expensive, and it means that means that's not going to be done.
But what if patients, if patients could do this test?
That would be a critical tour in the hospital. What would be patients, what if patients?
It wouldn't be expensive hospersonal.
It costs 300 percent, 300 percent, in the neurological action.
And so I want to tell you a unconventional methods, with which we're trying to reach the way that we're all trying to reach other, because we're all sense of my recognize.
Here's a video of video of video.
That's what happens when someone who's a speaker, we can look at the state of speaking, we can look at all of these stimmorgane, because we have to coordinate all of these voice, and we have to make the genes, and we all have to move the Gene.
And as Ballet, it's enormously exercise.
Think about how long a child, how long a child, until it.
And by the skin, we can represent the vibrating stimming stimming the gly, and as the glymorgane, and as the stimmorgane.
And on the both in the memory, you can see an example of unregular stimulate movement.
We're always see the symptoms.
And it's awaker, swing, swallow.
The language is so that I'm such a language, and that's an example of it.
And this expects, and the voice, sometimes, sometimes, but sometimes, sometimes, and the presentation, and presentation, and presentation, combined with new landscape, combines, and that's very exactly what's going to be exactly, we can now free.
How can these tests with clinical minical moment? Well, they're both of the neurologists.
And infrastructure. The infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. There's not being the stimulated by experts.
So you can be done by available.
They're very quickly, you're very quickly 30 seconds.
They're very brilliant and we know what that means.
If there's something extremely, you can also in big mass.
And this is amazing goals to this.
We can reduce logistic sistic switch.
Patients don't have to leadership in the clinics.
We can recording to data through highly,
We can make a free mass mass mass mass massive studies and recruitive studies and investigation of the population of the population.
We have now the opportunity to look for the first time to look for the disease, before it's before it's before it's before it's before it's possibility.
Today, we're doing this direction, we started the parkinson's Parkinson's simming.
With Aculab and patients LikeMeee, we want to take a very high number of stimulate enough to reach the world to the excited for the excited for the exciting of these goals.
We have rooms that are reputation of a billion people on this planet,
Everyone without parkinson, can be sunny, can be six of a few center for a few center. I give you a few center. I'm going to be able to be able to be eight hours.
Thank you.
If you say, if you say,000 people tell you, you can say, who's healthy is who you're not?
What are you going to do with all these probably?
What happens is that the patient during the patients, whether these person on parkinson, or not.
Some people don't get it to the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These are important, because we're important, because we're important to make these are important to parker for parkinson.
At the time, you're in 86 percent deact?
It's much better.
My subject -- I have to love him, because he's so fantastic worked -- now he's got to be a mobile phone, it's also working on the mobile phone, and we're going to be able to do with 9 percent.
That's what I call a better.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handy on the handy on the test. Parkinson's on the test, their voice, so that their voice, so that their doctor of the disease of the disease of the disease.
That's exactly.
Thank you. Max Ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here's what I live in Kenya on the south of the National Parks.
In the background of my father and the box of my father and the kitchen is the National Park.
The Nairobi national park is in the south of southern Southern Southern Southern Canbras the wildlifebras the park.
The reauvants that are the solutions, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that were killed. I wake up. I thought, and I found it was dead. It was awful bully. It was our only bull.
My struggle, the stamm of the massai, we believe that we were collecting our animals, and the why we got together. That's why we're so much.
I learned to eat, I learned to hate.
Our warrior warrior morane. They're using our struggle, and our case. They're also remaining this problem.
and kill the solutions.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a lot of the Nairobi- National Park.
In my struggle between six years between six years, and nine years, and it was also a box.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Few was Fews. Lions for fire.
But then I realized that we could help us to help us to help us to see the cows to see the cows.
But I didn't go on. I didn't do it.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to do it with a vird.
I wanted to think that the solutions, I wanted to stand up the cow.
But lions are very clearly clearly clear.
They come up, you see the birds and go back. And then they go back. But they're going to move and say, yes, and yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
And they killed and killing our viety.
One night, I wake up the stall. I love with a fackel in the hand around and that's not going to him.
Lions for a light for a light that moves.
I had an idea.
And as a little boy, I worked all day, I was in my room, and I took the new room, and I even the new room, and I had took me together. But I had took me a lot about electronics.
I took an old autobattery and a rolling a rolling a motorcy. The right, whether you want to go down to the left. He's basically.
And I was worried a switch to the lights and out of lights.
This is a little bit of a broken tape.
And then I built everything.
The solar panels the battery that battery that battery, the battery. I call it a transformator.
And the direction of the regularly blind.
You can see that the births, because of the outside, because of the solutions.
And this is what it looks like this, if they come up.
The lights blinks and the lions and the solutions that I was about the case.
Thank you.
I've been installed this installed and since we didn't have a problems.
And then we heard our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and she was lost their animals and she could ask myself if I could installing.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
And so I've been since they're in the neighborhood and they're really good.
My idea is now going to be used in all the ceny, even for other robust, even for other running or leoparning. The lights. The lights.
My success, I'm a stip, a stipendium on one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really excited.
My new school, and my new school, and helps and helps and reactions and address.
I even my friends with my friends with my friends and I'm not using the lights, and I'm not using the lights, and I'm not using them.
A year ago, I just a boy from the Savanne, who was harm. I saw Flight, and I looked at me and said, "I'm going to sit on a sit on a sit on a sit."
And here's what I'm going to do.
I was drawing with airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a big, I want to be airplane and Pilot. That's my great traum.
I've been walking lions. But I can save my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the solutions, and we can live without side, side, without side, without street.
Ash<unk>n. In my language. In my language is, I'm very much.
You don't know what it's not what it's like you're a story like your story as your story.
So you've got this stip sendium.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list of the list?
So my next experience, I'm working on a electrical caunch of electrical electrical electrozaun?
Yes, I know, I know, electrical cities are already, but I want to have my own.
You've been already trying to try to try to do it again, I've been trying to give up, but I was trying to get a battle.
Every start is hard Turder. Richard Tures, you're a little bit of a best.
We're going to put your friends, because of your friend.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And I'm since I'm a camera in the hand, is photography, but today, but today, I want to share with you 15 of my favorite, and no one of my favorite.
There was no kind of director, no chance, no chance, no chance too bad. Not even the picture. Not even the book.
In order to be honest to be capital to be decided by the tourists.
My story begins when I was in New York, and my wife, and my wife, and my wife, on my daughter on my daughters on my arm. We were on my arm.
And so, we were later, we were in New York and so we decided to same picture.
Well, you can see what you can see what it looks like.
When the thirday, my daughters, my wife, "Hey, why don't you do not looking for New York and do it a father-time, and do it?
And at the time we started to make a please, we're going to make a please of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universality is when you're a completely the best friends.
Nobody has ever said no one has ever said, and fortunately, and it's not done with our camera.
And at the time we didn't know how much of our lives.
And this journey is very holy.
This is just after the 1111. September 11. And I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a day, so that a five-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-
These images are much more than just a far more than just a certain moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a way to do a week for a week, and as we're going to change our time and how we change our time, not only physical, not only physical, not only physical, not just physically.
Because even though we do that, we're going to changes our perspective of miles, and while they're always new miles, and I'm going to see the life with all of them, and how they look like it.
These very intense very intense we spend with each other, and every year we're expecting every year.
Last, while a last time, we went to our rice, we were place, and place, and place, they're going to show them how to love them on a rocket, and they'd learning to a puppet.
And she told me about her feeling of their feelings that they had as a five-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-y
She said that she remember how you remember the heart of the breast nine years ago, when they saw the first time.
And now she looked at New York to High schools because they're in New York.
And I realized, I realized what we all created, the most important thing we all create.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you, an active role in the memories of memories of memories.
I don't know how it looks like it, but I'm looking at this 15 pictures of these 15 pictures.
I'm always the picture.
I want to start to tell you about today today, and I'm going to ask you to ask you, "Would you do not be a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 13.00, 42.1/19.1/9.2/4.8 (BP=0.948, ration=0.949)
