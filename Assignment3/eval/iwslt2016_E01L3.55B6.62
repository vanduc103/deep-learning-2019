When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the cells of the cells.
My father, hearing on his small, women whole nights, the No.
He looked very happy, very happy to be very untiliously, it was in the night, most of the night.
He's the qualiban, "Taliban!"
I didn't know what the bad thing that means, but it's very good father, very good.
"Je can go on a slight," he said," he said," he said," he said," he said, "Jeah," he said, "Jeah," he said," he said," he said, "Jeah,"
The morning I'm going to take a nobody.
All right now.
The Taliban he was in Afghanistan, as I was six, and I was six, and it was to go to the money.
And so I started to be slow me to the long years ago, and I started myself, and I started to go to yourself, not all of you're not going to go from your slime.
And so we could go to the slide.
Every day, we could take a different way, so we could never might be a different way that we could have a different way.
We were able to make our books in Enink, it would be so it would be such as well asked it would be a small.
We were in a house, we were in a house of 100 million dollars in a small.
In the winter was incredibly, but incredibly, it was incredibly unbredible.
We all know that we all of our life: We all of our life: Lacher, books, and our else.
And in the until the university of the university for a weeks, because the talible for a weeks.
We were never been talking about how much about it.
You know, they're going to be?
Who they're going to be?
We had after we wanted to go to the slight.
I had a great great great deal with a family, in the both, in the book, and well, and we were created.
My grandfather was a time.
At the eyes of a provinced provincinistanistanistan. He was bad -- it's my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and it was approached by the father.
My mother mother mother, but it was a teacher.
This is it.
A few years ago, they were in the road, just to our house, and women and women and women who areas.
And my father -- here's the first time in his family, the first family, the first time.
For himself was that it was a children who was a children would behavior, but also behavioral, the talible, all the risk.
He looked like a lot of larger roads, it's not to be a lot of children.
I know that I don't know that I was in the talibanched by our life, from our life, from our lives, from our lives, and the personality,
I went to the late, but I had told me, "There I said, "Tubey, you can hear in your life.
And my money can be done. You can be in the carbon. You're going to be a hand.
But a sentence is going to be more and more and more, which is what we need to believe that we need to be able to be able to be able to do that.
So -- so you want to be still?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, the year, through the year of the country of the country.
As more than 6 percent of my alters have a hightened a high-borhood-countered, and if my friends, and if my friends, I would have a picture of this women, I would have a women.
And states I'm going today, as a states, as a states of Middley College College.
And when I was after I was back to the back, my grand, the greater, the family of his family, because it was approached, because it has been a high school, the first time, the first time.
He don't just practically with my hands, but also the first question that I was the first question of the first question of the carbularly.
My family is believe me.
I have a great trees, but my family, but my family for me.
And so I'm a global bothers for 1010, a women whole world, a women who were the both of women.
And so I've heard to be survived, and maybe the first time, and maybe approach to the Internative, in Aghanistan, in the country, in the country.
It's why the sline, like the sline of my slides with my slides with them, all of themselves.
And to see how their else and vacter for them, like this, as I think it's my else, and I'd believe me.
So as a car. That's not really came, and I can't show you its not show you a carbon, but the vad of my cool.
And there was a months were being and he was in the highter and on the SOLA, and they're going to be a bomb, and they're going to be a bom of the countries.
When he was a home, the telephone, and a telephone and a stimp, fallows, fallows, and it would be trying to be send.
And then he said, "There me, if you want to be, I'm going to be the future of my terms of my factors on the same time, and you know, and we're going to be faster.
What I've been afteristanistanistan, I have something that I've been able to be afterest, the windows, most of us, most of us, the first well, the water, the water, and it's a values, and it's also being.
That's not that our mother mother, our mother rule of our experience in our explain.
These areas are hard to be the same thing that are possible for a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of their terms of their terms of the face of the society of the United States of the university.
The tales the Taliban, just went to the slightly, because it was a bad -- the slide.
But everyone in Afghanistanistanistanistan, three million million million million million million million.
After the first time he's after America, so differently.
The Americans, like us, like us, as the same ways.
If you don't want to changes are not from Derman and changes, and I think it's all over the U.S.S.
But when I was in Afghanistanistan, if I'm slides in my slides, and their else, and they're going to be approach them, and then I'm a lot of well, and then I'm a lot of well.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope and independent and increased me, and it's possibility, and the sense of the sense.
And I think they have a great deep.
Thank you.
All I do something that I do that, I was a life -- my life -- I was in Africa, in Africa,
from 1971117, I'm sort of young -- but I'm not in Sambia, I've been in Sambia, the Ela, and Samia, and Samia, and the African laborate African long Laran.
I have a matalia, and everyone work and everyone and everyone and every projects, we've been on the box.
I was trying to be.
I thought about 21 years, we thought that we're going to work and work in Africa, and I'm going to work.
And states we'd all well, we all know what we're doing.
We're instant project, what I was going to be my first book, "Ripped to the campaign," inspiration, inspirational world, the samples of the same thing.
We came with the south America in South Adambia, in this tales, in this tales, which is the Sambia. We're going to be a slime, and we have a sudience and the terms of the Terminata.
And of course, the answered to the an interest information, so well, so well, so we're doing it, and you're doing it.
We were instead that it was in a such a such a slightly, no land.
But attention, they didn't know why they were not simple, "Gotike," we're simple," here's here.
"Goes, you go to the people who are people who are people who are the people who areashion."
And of course, all of all of all the Africa.
We had this practice, we had this practice. Internalia, in Sambia, in Sambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Sambambline, like Landwitch.
When the Tomata, and running about 2001, about 2001, and family, and family, all of all of all of all of all of all.
We said, "Oh, we said, "Oh, the nilm," the nilm.
And they said, "Ja, we have no lander, we don't have a sland."
"Why didn't know that you don't know, "I don't know, you never thought us."
I thought we were such as well, so it was so such as africa, but then I was going to do what I do do doing, which is what the English, what I was going to do.
We felt the number of the nilm.
They should see the univers -- you should see the university, because we don't see the United States.
They should be the book of Damba America Moy Moya, it's a sambically scientists.
The Book, the 20099,
We have the eventually, we have 150 million centuro in the last 50 million years ago.
I'm going to tell you what this is what this is what this is what this gone has been.
Look you just to their book.

Because they went to the monist.
At the 180 technology, the technology, the life of next technology,
What happens? 40 years later, 19400 years ago, in the United States, 11001, 111001.
The idea, a different technology, the other technology, the running. It was a small small smaller.

Five years ago, I have to be as it, where it has to be the West Wood.
The state state of the University -- a drazed me -- a drawing -- in the University -- in the countries.
I had angry --
And you know, you know, a students with their students with their brain, and their brain and their brain and their brain, and their books, not sort of their books.
But as the society, he was sended, he was like me, as age, as age, and it's a whole world, and a whole world.
And I felt like I felt like I was as I was going to be the students, I was felt like this. I was going to be the otherwise, and I wanted to be the other words.
I believe this terms to the same way to be a great cartoon.
We need to make a great couple of cartoomation of our scientists and in our scientists, to changes.
Because our scientists and innovation are the biggest problems, as well asking the memory, for example, and if we don't know what we don't know, and if we don't know it's not going to believe it. I don't believe it. I don't believe that well believe that we don't be
But this great large, if we don't get our scientists and in their scientists and in their wonderful.
So scientists and innoved, bit, clearly, clear.
I want you to show you a few sort of how it could see it, how we can see that we can see that we can see that we can see the technology, and the technology, and it's a slight.
The first question that the first question, and it's: Na, Na, and it's like it.
Say, we're going to know, it was such a scientifically, so it's social for us.
And you don't just that their trees, but also says, but also says, but also says that they can also say that they can use the magnitive countries, because they can make it is important because they can go to the most important thing.
And when you do this, what they do is what they do is it, then you do.
After the body are a hands for changes.
Shere's what you could changes and countries, but why are not simple, but why they don't we changed, and what's a lot of time?
We don't make itself is not to make it is not the same thing that's not the same way to make it.
As asteroided said, "Meah, but it's just like this.
You can see something that's something about something eyes, you know, without a service, without anything, without the same way.
A few things areas, there are sort of sort of sort of service, and approach their ways.
And when you do it works, you know, then you go to the stories that are the stories.
Habes their early, why it was like, "Shere's what it means "Stay?
What happens when you see if you're going to be different? As you're going to be audience, and you know, and you know,
And a following is not just just just slow, but also sort of very longer, but also, and we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be survivor.
And this example, this is a lot of greater of Greater, we're much more well. They show you that the trees of the trees of the trees of the trees of the same way that they're a sort of the signification of the digitiously.
The Trick is a simple, a simple, simple satellite the publics that publics, if it's audience, and it can be approach their others and our sublics and ourselves and we can make ourselves.
These are only a few might be the same way to help us to help us to see the wonderful and the scientists and the technology and the technology and the technology.
And the intelligence, I have been story, I have been sort of me, with the <unk>Ner," in my cell phone, I want to make everything I want together with a same way.
So the scientists areas of scientists, and the economics, and the researchers, social relationships, so that's important, and what's important to be the economics, and it's uncredible.
So scientists and innovation, if you're simple, indeed me, clearly, clearly on me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my hand.
A honey can changed and a personality and a personality.
And you can see a handy can be a humanity in Syrience in Syrience.
And you can have a hone can make a network and a prototype, and a production.
And with a handley, you can take a long-Clouds, and you're going to be sounds and both.
All this is possible.
I'm a year, and I'm live in Blin.
And we go back into this stads in this stad.
And you can see how hundreds of people who can changed by people who went on the streets and the street.
We're in 1998, and we're going to be able to changes, and we've changed and changes in the tasks.
Who's a hand?
And you half it.
You know, you know, you half, you half you'd half.
Hal you high. All right. Araid, a black, wow.
These are many fast year, everyone has a honey.
But I want today and my hand and my life and talk about it, and I think it has changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about it.
This is 3580, 330 colleagues.
Rohood.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer, the E.
This is the runny is called Rightsline.
And this room, the runningle telephants in Europe, everyone in Europe, everyone internet, everyone in the Europe, a bread.
Who you go to the same? Who you have a milk?
Who you know, why?
And if you have a honey boys, where you're going to be.
All these information, information for the months of your months of your television or your internet or your Internet or your Internet.
And over the Europe are the people who have been on people who have been wanted to say, "Thash, we don't want to have."
They said, we want to do this brought this process.
We want to be slimate ourselves in the though time, and we don't want to be the television and information, and we need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
There was approach, Journalist, Journalists, all of you said, "Thash, we don't want to say, "Thash, we don't want to say, "Thism.
And here you can see how we can see people on the street of people on the street of blind, and says, "Free-free-free-free-fear-f-fear-fear-fourth.
And you say, this is so that could be sort of stas, 20.
The stas was the same thing that was the same thing in Onection.
And I wondered me, it really works, it's really work.
Can you really want to be all these information?
Every time, when I was a bit of my hand?
So I wondered my telephants, the distribute telecomes that the biggest telephants in the large, and I was faster, and I was founded me to me.
And I wondered them, and I wondered them and went to the right, and no light. Nurther.
But then I wanted to me, because I want to have this information, because it's a protoces.
So I decided to me to be a greater, and I wanted to have a lot of these information, because I wanted to have this information.
But the drawing telecomes, no, we're going to be information.
At the end of it, it's a same way.
I'm going to go back to me, where they allow me to me, all of the information.
Because in the correction of the bonderful for the best processary that the emotion.
So I'm going to have this hard to be sort of countries with a CD.
And on the CDD.
3580,000 cells.
And then I went to me, and I said, it's half, it's a half metim.
But then I went to after after after my life.
These are six months of my life.
So I was a little bit, what I think I think about what I think I think about what I think about what I think about it?
Because you see, where I'm going to be after what I'm going to do.
But then I wanted to me with this information of information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show you what the people want to do is the realization.
So for the time, and open and opened, I have this guy here.
This is a visualization of the six months of my life.
You can record the records and serious, you can go back and you get back and back.
You can do every single, I do it, I do it.
And you can see how I can see how I'm going to be after the flying curiously, and how many of the foreign, and how many of the forever.
All this is possible.
That's a little bit of a little bit.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
And then it's just as I think it's just my wife and woman, and we're talking about a few malander.
And then I'm going to be a few friends and they're a few friends.
And after a way young, and you're looking at this time, and we have this right now, and we have this grandmunications.
But you can see how people can see people with your communicate, to be approach them to get away from the bed.
You can see all of all of all of you can see.
You know, you know, you know, you're going to be approach the figure of the group.
If you can see this information, you can see what you can see what the society.
If you can take this information, you can have the society, you can do the society.
This is a big pan for the changes like China and the iran.
This is the perfectly, as you can see how you can be a society, because you know, because you know, you know, because you know, you know, it's a possible, all of these information.
And these information areas, we're going to be 6 months, in Europe, in Europe.
As I think we'd say, we'd say that all these people in the country that people in the country in 199898, in 199898,
And the stasiff, who had been done who was going to be able to do it, and if the stration, and if the stuff, the paybe it's going to be.
The fall of the bubblin maybe not states, maybe not statting.
And also, not the fall of the faller of the real prediction.
Because today, and firms and firms and firms, as many information, and how they can be able to be able to be able to be able today.
They want to be the possibility, our life, and they want to be able to be longer.
But slime, and a life and a life and a life, there are not a wider.
Everyone to the slimate of the same way today.
They have to be a day.
So if you go back home, you go to your friends, you know that pratterns, and you know that the 21st century.
If you go, you go, you go, you're going to be a firms, because it's approach the mindows, and we have to be able to do it.
And if you don't believe your telephant you're going to believe your television, you know, you know,
So in the future, every time, every time you know, if you have to be your hand, you know, you have to be able to be the same time you have to the same time.
Thank you.

And I decided it, it's so in standing.
So I came and my group, the line. Green. Green, and we found myself, and we found myself, and we food, and we're going to panels, so that the whole program, so that's the program.
We're a kind of a kind of approach, we're going together from Garararen and all of all the whole city and all of the whole city, and everything, and we do.
And the garge is that beautiful.
But then young might be someone.
The stadly, and he was sort of me, and he was a practicity and said that I had told me that I had to be a best way that I had to be a huge.
And I thought, "Chere's right?
And a richeral annocial piece of nights from a stage of a stage, it's a country, it's yourself?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her.
Because this malth, it wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times, the window. Steve Lope, Steve Lope, and we'd talked about the story of the city and with a middle of the first time, and you were a petition. They were a city and well-free-fourse.
We'd like you to change the hands.
My strategy, and he said that she said that she said it, and he said that they love, and we do.
So, you know, why they shouldn't do that?
LA. A. It has in the United States that most of the most books in the book.
They're going to be 7762 countries.
These are 20 company park.
This is apply, to the same time to the 75 million dollars.
Why do they shouldn't find it without it?
And the answer of a personal country, you know,000 people -- 10,000 samed.
And the biggest biggest of a dollars of a dollars, and you're on the Warth.
It's my failure, I say, I say they're sure that they should be approach them.
And it's audience is like it is like it is like it.
You see, I have a south Central Central Central.
I went to me. I've been suddenly on the same thing.
And I know, part of this teach me, part of this represention of people who had been been founded by people who was fably, and I was my own.
You see, I'm a couple of a couple.
And the gray is my grandi. I'm public.
Grands like a graffiti-known, the wall, the wall, I think I'm going to changes and Park.
I'm going to be the married, like a stage, and the piece, and the personal and the powerful for these stops.
They're going to be surprised, if you can see if you can use it as a country,
They don't think about how it's a sune of a sune, and how people are people are breaking people.
So what happens?
I have been experience like my garden instrument for the experience and the experience and the country.
And to changes the community to changed together, you have together.
We're the boys.
They would be be a wonderful, like children will be a children.
Garning is the same thing, and the first time and carbon, you can do with the best city.
And you know, you know, you know, you know,
If I remember this mother, as these mother, and they were came out of the campaign, and I was felt like my brain, and I was skill, and I'd like this.
I'm going to be sleeply, because they were sort of them, and I said, "What's not going to do that.
The garge is not without the street on the street."
I've been sure, when I looked like me, and I've been highly, and that's just hard to do this.
And I said, "Thumber, no, no, no, no an angest, I don't know what they know.
And so it's sure on the street.
That's what the idea.
I want it to take it, but I want to take it, but I want to take them back to the society."
And a other time, I was a garge in this old time in this obsove in Dow Law.
These are the Types that are the type, because the laster.
It was cool and they were in their stories, like it, and how they have been able to see their mother and how they'd believe their mother, and it was going to see it, and it was just like it.
Green the reason, so it has been about 20 Garman.
We're going to be able to came up with five people, and the 50 people who are all of the free.
If you have children, it's children, it's children.
If they were sended, it turns out.
But if they don't get it into it, if they're going to get it, as it's going to get it, and the body, and it's always getting what they're always going to be.
I see people who works, people who works, but they want to work in this ding, but I'm sort of children who areas, the piece of the piece of the brain, and the brain.
The Gargary, I think I think we can use this children, where we can use these children can make their own lives to create their life.
And if we do that?
We could take the next terrorith Carversity.
But if we're going together, we're not changed, we're going to do that.
So this is my ples. That's what I want to do.
I want to be a whole walk on the same person whole person who are person in the bubble, people can be able to be the bubble.
I want to take a slower and they called Caful Caful Ca.
So you don't go to me.
I don't talk about costs, because it's not after, because it's not after.
The communically, you have to behavior.
I'm talking to work, people work, people who work, and children, and children, and they're going to be the free, and the circularly, and if you get its own, and if you're in the open.
So what I want to do is that, this is what I want to do.
I want to be that we all of the same thing, Ganger, Ganger, Gangerman, Gangerman.
We need to be the both of Ganger.
If you don't know, you're not a ganger.
And you're going to be with the slow, clear?
And lason the words of the same number.
If you want to make me to make me, you don't want to be involved me to make me to make me to make a meting, and you want to make it, where you want to make it.
If you want me to be a create yourself with your brain, in my brain, we can use it, we can personal.
From. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my lower of my favorite in the Exord Axord English World Warterygoster.
Because it's so hard.
And "snoygoster" is the political politics,"
One of the 19th century in 19th centuries, a better drawinger: "Theygoster: "Theygoster, the snower, the astander, and the paradigm, and the parential program, and the parent.
I don't have anything, what I don't have a slight.
I think that's what I think about worning.
But it's very important that the World World Worlditics, and all knows that they're trying to try to try to try to make them.
At 171, for example, for example, the britical parents, not the lament of the skills of the data.
And that's actually, in fact, the mother of a mother mother named Mean Crossssss, the crosssss,
They was approached in the terror, and he was a muth, but he was a muthor, he was really maybe it was a lot of countries, and so many different countries, and it was so much more untily.
And only one few years later, we find the first time we find the first time, we find the first time, like the satellite of the brought.
Braterial water on the English word for bad for bad.
But that's not going to go back to a seriously on the prest prest.
But to show you how we're going to show you how weeks, and Politics, I want to take the United States, as they'd like themselves.
You see, you look at the question of how to be the opposite, which is the staff, noise, noise.
You know, you know.
How do you take the an epident of a repeply?
And there was a longer in the congress.
And there were all of it, all of the same way.
I wanted to him, you want to take it, what I neurons, and other sensors, and other skills, and what's the other people who areas of people who areas of the valuality of people who are the United States.
Not so a piece of it.
Some people wanted to take it.
They thought that it was six.
They were not months, they were to be the cost for a bit for a bad time for a bit of time.
It would be work.
But everyone was increased, because this is because these things that are three weeks.
I have the tages of a sentence of a sentence, the same thing: "Immber the same thing.
The reason for the reason for the longer and the longer, the running the satellite.
The represention, nothing that what the realized that what's going to be. They didn't want to be. They don't want to be.
Couldn't be a little bit more possible to be in Islike.
They wanted to the most experience, you know, someone who had been costs, the first day.
This is the Titels, "Prident.
Prident. They have the title. It's not existed. It's existed. But it means that someone who's been a valualuation.
So something like this, something like a Jury.
He had not more reason, as the reason, or "Ano," or "Apass" or "Apass"
And sometimes it was practice smaller, and you know, and the smaller, but it was a really unconnected, but it was a unconomes.
And so that's why the sentence of him.
They said, "This is not longer, you can't take the prident.
This countries have to come from the same and countries and changes.
Who's going to take it, when he's going to take a small smaller, like President of America?"
And also, weeks, well, the sentence of the satence.
And you know, you know, you know, the tities, and you know, "Prident," but they wanted to be able to be able to be approaching it.
You can see it in three things things that are more interesting things.
The first -- and this is what I've been doing -- I don't know if I didn't know if young might be the satellites that we have been done.
Barack Obama, Prident Obama, the title of the title. It was just just just just going to be the sative.
The second thing you can learned that when you say that something that's something that's something that was a temporary -- you know, you know, you have 22 years ago.
Third, and that's really important, the most important thing that's important, the Titles of the United States of America,"
The more than 5,000 nuclearly,000 nuclearly, and the most followed the world, and the world of the world and a freeks and a food and this is the world.
We have a story of story of the tities.
And so the sentence of the end of the end.
They have a bit of a slightly.
And the other sorge of the same thing that was the same thing -- never know, it was so that it was so.
But you know how many national nation?
17474.
Because they all know how the countries, like the countries,000 nuclear large.
So the end of the sentence and the sates and the represention, because no one who never might be a whole day, if you're going to be the publics of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing to do with me, and I'd been done.
Politics, we try to make the research to make the rest of the representationality, but the reality, but the reality of the reality of the world, and more than the world could changes.
Thank you.
So I came in a laster with a laserally five years ago, campaigns, a 1990-year-year-year-year-year-year-oldson, Florida.
I'd like myself Convernments of the half of a paradarad, and I needed a parady and a rocker of the running of the running.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistanistan.
Now, I was a longer, I was a greater, all of the campaigns, and the pychama, and Fallball, and Fallball.
But that's the opposite of the same thing.
And so I'm going to take after Afghan, South, South After Athe-the-the-theists and atheists and a few years ago, the last year, the last few years ago.
So there's after the world, many things that you could do with the collection of the collection, but I couldn't beautiful, I want to make the personality. I want to make the personality and we're going to make it.
I want to be a day in life, I want to be a decided to be a distributed, the city of the city of the couple of the country, and well, and we're going to relationships and relationships and political car.
And what you can do the distrible, as the parad, as the parent for the parents and a number of the slographics, "What's what I'm going to do." I'm going to do."
And we try to take these campagness to take these machine, to make these magaiosio, as a national.
I want to be the corruption of the correction of the campanistan, and we're going to take a projects of the policy, and you know,
I want to go to me to me, like the conomianistanistanistanistanistanistan, the "Moday.
The campaign and the free-down, the free-down, and we have a new campaigns, and Moley and maybe you can only a new skills, and you can take a money, and you can make a sata.
And I would be simple, like audience of carreate between the cellular cells about 18989898, today,
But for all these things can be in the opposite, they can be missed, they're going to be fly fly fly.
But I have to do it because I have to be because I have to be the slow.
That's my last. Where is yourself?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russus and since I worked as a math.
The 10 years ago, it's about 10 years.
I have the same thing that now now now now now here in the room, I have a untilired to be a until that I didn't have this clearly.
And I think I have something that I have something that well, I have something that we've been snow.
This is the first time that the first time that you can see that the TED-B-B-B-B-B-day, so I think that's happy.
Fall a few women really, I was really a few, as I had to say that, you need to say that I need to say that I don't have to talk about Twitter.
I'm going to be that I'm going to be approached, because I'm very clearly in 10 seconds.
And so that's not all the chance.
These are very unconfortunity, it's good, I don't want to be good.
The first thing is the first part of my cope, the pullovered my cope, you're all of my copularly, you're not going to be a copy.
In ordination.
Why do I have this?
That was personally.
Now, it was not so pictures, it was like this both.
As a might be a might be a idea is own.
I've been going to changed by me in 666 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been a friend.
I feel very until me, and the photographed me, I said, I said, I went back and I was in the huge of my hands.
And in the operations or the operations or the fal bridge of myself, I'm going to work on the work, there's very impossibility of our own possibility, and we have a big difficult of our lives -- it's untility.
For the food is to be to be me, it means to be a bit.
And I'm going to be a math, because I'm a math.
I'm going to go on this book, because I know, because I'm a huge, and I'm a brane, and we called the same time.
I'm going to be the questions that people who are always the people who are always, but on the real way.
The first question said, "Where's going to be a math?"
I say, "Oh, I was sent," but the bed," but the meaning.
The real years ago, like I was a math, a mathy, a guy in the mathy and a important, and maybe you might be a best friends.
Now, in the last year, we have been personality, we have not just as a healthymmmmmetrically, and we're going to be able to be programs, but we're going to be a great.
This is a result for me to be a multiple, and it's a experience.
I know there are people in the publics that the punctical, and maybe some maybe some maybe some maybe a few maybe, "Hiana, Nala, John. No. Jo.
And then I'm going to be your mathember of your math. Shel. Sh.
But I have to tell you that, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very countrying Doctor of the NYou know, all the name time, everyone has been a year, and everyone was a year, and it was just a money, and it's not only 2767 percent of the 27,
The next question, the whole question is going to be a math, "Can I'm going to be a math?"
And then I went to me, I don't know, "I don't know, it's not in my creaturance."
But the second answered this little bit of these little money, "Why?
Because you know what? You can be all of you will be.
You can be practice the United States or the U.S. or the next internet or a nine-year-year-year-old or iron.
If you have to be after that still say, "No, no, no, no," I want to be a math," I want to be a math," I want to be my camera."
Because I didn't have to be approach the country, and you could be the American vogue or the American vogue or the next mountains or the next money.
And then you say that you're going to be a math, it's like you, you know that you would say that you want to be a bottom.
You can't be able to be fantastic and it's not a carratically.
Now, I want to tell you about 10 years ago, Models, the science of the other than the hands, because it's just just a sure.
If you're going to be a photograph, and you know, like a neter, and you're going to be a cameron, and we want to be a four hours, and then we're going to be after that.
It's like this.
Hopeful, it's more community.
That was not what I don't know what happens.
If you look at the slight and a life and a few years, and a few years, you know, you can't say, if you say, you say, "Sitch" and you want to be a few years, but you want to be away from the United States," you're going to go to the United States,"
The next question, the first question is, "Where's the foots, all of the focused?"
And yes, so it's all the photoss, but it's just a small part of the story of the story of the story of the story.
This is all the first picture of the most picture, and that was also the first time I was also a biox that I had a biox. I had no personalio.
I know that now now now, now, but I'm going to be a personal, but I was a young might be a young might be a young money.
So I looked at a few months, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm going to be on the day.
My friends, I had to start me.
This is what I'm on a py, a few, a few day, a few day for the early for the early.
This is what I'm going to be with the Faller and in the Vagazinazin.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these bilders are not bilder of me.
It's cructed and it's construction of a group of profession, from Hazappoces and Marlists and family and fly and the cities and their else and the evention and I'm not work.
Okay, as a number of people who written me, "Kan you're always like, you know, you know,
Yes, I have many-cretimate 20-creased, I never seen, but I'm never getting things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to be the same time, and I don't go to the life.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, and one day, I had a law, and I had a launch of my money.
When I was a teacher my friends, with my friends, and they were a food, and they were a repected and course, and we needed to be approach. It's just approach. It's a hightending, and we could be farm.
I have this costs of myself, I'm going to go to my personality and nothing my personality and there's no personality and not a personality and not a personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teachers, the last year, and I was filmed by the last year, and most of the last year, and most of the last time.
It's just in New York,000 years ago,000 years, men, and latines, and latines, and I don't know, "Where Is, I'm going to be?
So what I'm going to be, I'm going to be? When I'm going to go on?"
And I think about this values for these values I wonderful, I'd like 1333 percent of their body in the United States, and they don't want to be able to be 17 percent of them.
The last question is, "Where's a model, it's a model?
And I think they believe them to be these answered: "Where you're a little bit more and believe it, you feel, you feel, you feel, you feel and it's very behind, and it's very good.
And Back, we maybe we maybe a question that maybe it's a power.
We say, "There's really a lot of such as a lot of creative, and it's a creative people who works, inspiration, people work."
All this is just a bit, but it's just a half of the story that we never thought, which is what I never say, "It's what I've been saying, "It's like me," is," is, "Ihere me."
And I feel like me, because I have to think about myself, I have to think about my experience.
And you know, you know, "Where I think, I think I think, if I believe you, and I think you have been happened?"
And then you should have a few mathodels, because they have the most cool, and the most person and the most potential, and the most cools and the most cools and the most of their own personality and the most panet.
When I was very good at this valuable, he was very good, very difficult, a very good bit more bilant, because I'd been very good, because I'd been very until me, and I'd say, "It mean, and I was going to get a bit of my campa. And I was going to get a bitike. And I'day. And I
It was very difficult, very difficult, a result of university, and risk and Rask, and running a greater.
I'm also behind, and I'd believe me, and I'd like to get it, and I'd like this.
If you look like this virtual, then we're allows that we allow us to our ideas of the idea of ourselves and follows and follows.
Thank you.
I have the words of my grandmother nobody never been countrying, the Exily, "Sonists," is," is,"
But now, you're going to be something like a gadave a gad.
It's two years ago, the sities that are the sitution of the sitution of the since of the brain of the brains of the massive of the mindows in the same way.
I was a lot of other laby, in many other laby, in memory and eye, and we have a day of the countries of the countries and to a terrorder to the trees of the revolution.
And it was a great revolution.
June, the women and women and men and men in the first time, in the first time, which is the end of the running, the ran of the free, and social.
They have to be a mother muthor, to be able to make themselves, told the brutal Di.
They have a sense of sense for sort of sides, farmers, farmers, in the south, in the south.
And so, after after after months of the months, and fast 50,000 trees,000 takes us to the trees, and we're going to start.
Gada, everyone has a great big big big big big, a large, the tyrorism, the curruption and the current.
And the four year, the city has been done, Danny, and the Infrastructure of the infrastructure of the infrastructure and the moral lawsy.
The prediction and the house and the house, I women, I women who I was like many women whole women, the civily, we're going to be able to use a survivate and well-dimal and dragy and national equal possible.
And so we'd been 200 organizations were went through the fallow and unmitable in Bghafter the biggest, in Brazil.
After three years ago, I came back to Look, and I started to after after the Enthmas, I started to the same time, I started to the same time, and the humanity and human beings, and the past.
And a women of women areas of women, I women who I women who were approaching the same of women, approaching of women,
And I think I'm going to be a very switch, a very hard to the United States, and more political political political political political political political political political political.
I liveed a initiative of the free-bychological women, women who have been a bit of women, and a laws, and it's a bit of the brought.
At the end of our initiative and he was going to be initiative.
Women women who women's been in the national national choice.
But longer, but everyone eye of the eyphories and the whole number of the whole number of the same time, we were to be news.
A morning we were trying to the money, we changed the money and survivalues and Skay.
And we have a other morning, we have the morning of the Mordan American bothers and the bottom.
And then, again, the first time, the effects of opened by the arms.
And every day, we're trying to the milix of the milix and their owners, and their opportunities and their opportunity and their opposed by the rules and their laws.
We've been able to be a revolution of a revolution, polution, polarized, polarized by the ideal and policies, and well, and well, social characteria,
Intold, explains, and rivers, and running the iconnected the Scolution.
I'm not going to talk today with it with the experience of our reversity of our reversity and the number of our numbers.
And then I'm going to talk today, we've been a nation that we have a national evention and the false.
We have our porities. We've been wrong.
Because the numbers of the number of stability or Shilary.
Hates the researchers and the river and the same way between the same country and men the free and national country and national valuational power?
No, it hasn't.
What is it?
Why is our society is going to be more politics and three-finite politics of the Dominan and the dominants, and the men,
Maybe the question was not the only thing that has been done, but the white of the middle of the middle of the brain, the brain.
We needed a national society and created a national and carbon, as they have the choice, the number of the end of the end of the polarization and the polarization.
We needed to be the society of the quality of the way of the way of the number of the next fantastic, evaluation of the body of the same way.
We need to be in the names of the name of the name of the road and a day and a day.
We need to be able to make the middle of the middle of the brain.
We need to be a white drawing, the followed, the followered, but also wouldn't just together, but also, but also being approach, the countries, approach.
This is the ideal, the ideal, the ideal science of science, the science of Life, to be free.
Because the free-f-f-thexy and in this alchement and in this alchanism and minorning subs and mines.
This is the real years, the river.
And we need to existence to make it, we need to do it, we need to do it.
After a village of Coranamal, "Samal" -- Fortune," the word "Theades," and you're sort of the word."
The word "shead" and over all the time, all of all over all of the same thing that's allowed by the same way, the same ways," and the word "by" and the mother," and the men.
And the mother like Mother Mother Mother Mother, in the Embry, completely, complex, it's socially the same time of the middle of the whole exists.
And so that's why well, "My memory, all of all these things."
And so that's why, "My memory has been a mind of my Greater."
We're all the brain is the brain is going to be.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country, and I was went to the world, and I went to the light.
And I was very struggle.
In the slight, we were the story of course, but we don't know, but we don't know much about much about it, you know, eye, America and our food, South America and our food.
And then I though I wondered, like the eyes, I thought I thought I thought my life, I would have been changed in the North Asia.
And I looked at the first time, I went to the first time, but I thought, but I thought, I thought my life.
My family was not working, and I had to live, and I had to live.
But in 199555 mother mother, with a bit of the college of a college.
And there's a standard, "Where's going to be able to be more family, because we've been on this world, because we've been family.
We love on the boys and our body, and our body is so hard to the body."
I was so hard.
I hear the first time, I hear that people in my country.
Curtimate, I went on the both, and I looked at something that I don't know that I don't know, I don't know,
All right now, woman woman, and approach, and approach in their works in their works in their works in their mother carter.
But no one half, because all of them, because all of them, all of them were allowed to colleagues and their families.
And the 1990s, there was a great hands in North America.
At the end of more than a million northanistan, the opened on the open, and many of the open, because they're only because they're just approach, and the bridge.
And stromously, and more and more and more, so it's been sured me to me, all of the longer, earth, the long of China, where we're going to be the United States.
I wondered me, and I was always got there, and we had not.
This is a satellitive of North America and his nights and his night.
This is the fly Amail, the piece of the teama, and the Corea and China and China.
As you see, the riversity can be very size and its very size and its north.
But many sort of same.
And sometimes I looked at the free.
I don't say, how I can say, "Tore I can say that I can say that I'd say that I'd say that I was going to changed by China, I was after China.
I thought that I thought that I thought I was a camily of my family.
I would have told me that it was 14 years ago, it has 14 years ago.
In China was very difficult, you know, as a bit of the family.
I had no idea of it, like the life, as the life as a normal fish fish fish fished it would be approach, but I would be just be approach, but it's very such a lot of a very economically, Islama.
So I lived in strong less than my life, my life, and I would be able to be a bad, and you would have after after the North America.
A testing, I was age of Alptray, as I was a biggest, I was a child, and in Polize and the police,
And someone who are important to be a northan, so I had my chinese, so my chinese, and my children and women,
I had solve my hand, I thought, I thought, I would be exploded.
And for the idea of it, I could be instead of course, I could be embrace, and we're going to be.
I thought that the end of my life, but I thought my life, but I could be my life, and I could be my life, and we could have the questions.
After they were fundamentally, she was a slight, a relationship, "That's a falm.
They're not a norther."
And they love me. It was a wonder.
Some of the Northana, in China in China, but many of the Asylish, but many of the changes of the changes of the countries.
These might be a girluck.
And then they were switched, they were fly, they were free, they were free-droundational drawing.
And this north Coreanornia, not so much lucky.
Every year, there's been a north core, in China and after the North America, where they're going to be able to be survived or ended or effect.
And then I though I had been slightly, it was a lot of other north coreore,
It's a sure that North Adan, and it's a hard to the identity and hard to create.
Add you have a new species, and worked and works and worked and works, in a moment in a moment in a moment.
After 10 years of the first time I decided to go to the south, and I have a new life, and I started a new life.
Micha in South Ada, no large, a greater, a greater, as I had told me.
English in South Ada, I had to learned that I had to learn my third.
Audience I have the big difference between North Ada, and South Ada.
We're all core, but we have a very, but we have a very common, in the 76 years ago.
If I was a idea of identity.
Bin I south or North American?
Where I'm going to do? Who I'm?
Pluddenly, there was no lander, my head, my head.
And there was approach the same thing that I did not listening, I had not family, I had a plan.
I'm going to be the same thing to me to the university.
And the idea of my life, I was a new life, he was a new life, I could have a bit of my news.
The north American body, I was family, I was in my family, and as I was family, and my family, and I was a place of the place.
They had to be such as possible as possible to plane.
North Arabaneous streets on the free-breaking on their way.
It's fastic, the green between North Ada and South Ada, Ironically, I'm going to take after China and we're going to take after the same way.
Because my family, I had to talk about 2, I had to live in 2000 miles, and then I had to China and then, and then we have to South Adia.
The business, weeks, and weeks, and we were more fastic.
As again, as the business, a chinish, a chinese police police.
He was the experience of all of all of all, and woman,
And I thought my family, I thought, I thought I thought me.
When the chinese mind my family, I started to be approached on and said that they were involved on theirselves, and I wasn't itself.
He looked at me to believe me, but it happy, but it's happy.
We've got to go to the lessonic big green, but I had to be all of my money, to try to try to the lossible.
But we had to be the greatest, we had been been been drawed, my family independent, illegal German.
After I was a money and smart and smaller, and my family indeed my family indeed, but my family. But my family in the city of the city of the city.
This was a greater rock of my life.
I had all the time to my family to the family, and we were such approached, but I had been family, but only my family, just the same of the same.
I went back and then, and I went to the police and the police and the police, and I had to try to be my family, but I had not enough to be approach, but I had not read.
I'm going to be all of my hope.
And so I wondered me the stimm, "What's loss?"
I was free-day, that's a free-tremaking a free.
In fact, I'm going to get a written and a written, I went to my situation and I went to a bank, and that numbers and the number of my family and the number of my family, and they get to get the family.
I thank you from all the whole hand and wonder and wondered, "Why do you?"
"I don't help you to help you.
"I want people to help the normal people."
Mird, this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The first thing that we needed to be symbolism for me, and a new hope for me, the North American, and we needed to show me the fundamentality of my friends and the fundamental.
And so, we were to be after the research, and I was family, but I'm going to be freeks, but the freeks, it's just a slane.
A lot of numbers of their families, and so that they're going to be in a new country, they're going to be able to be able to be a new country.
The International Gemental community, the both of the both, the both of the bottom, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Aucore, because of us, because of us, because of us, and we're going to be able to changes, and we're going to changed and we're going to change the North.
I had a guy, so much of hand and inspiration inspiration inspiration, I had hopean north cored north corever, without the International parents.
I'm sure you're more experience of North American coreored the world, but also on the world.
Thank you.
I just have a bit of a bit.
And you say, I don't say that I'm not.
I want to tell you my bridge.
Remique, and very good, very good.
He can't talk to you, but it's communicated freque, like a kind of the best rest of the best.
Remiber what is what low.
He's explained them to be able to be indeed, and he's increased.
It's not going to be after. It's not on the harf.
He don't know, not to be able to be able to be slightly, and you have a loud, you have a loud.
If you have to be a children, we're trying to the words, I don't know, I don't know how I'm going to be a sense of the same way, and how we know, and how we know, and how to be.
Samuel is 16. It's very good. It's very good.
He has a slightly unfortable.
But it has a slexically.
It can't be able to be when my sense, and he's been able told me, but he's approaching the public lower of everyone, in my face, we had been able to be the first time, the first time, the most of all of my countries, all of myself.
How do they don't it incredibly?
But many people don't stimate.
And in fact, because it's not in the society of normal valual pastic, and they're going to be more and falth and falth and falth.
But what my hands, and myself, and my soule, and myself, whether it wasn't just been told them when they were not only been in the same way they were just a bit of them, and it could be auth.
Now for the open of you who don't know that it's not such as a complexism," is a complex. It's a complexity of the brain, the brain, the brain, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,
It's a sure of everyone, everyone is, but it's a slightly, it's so differently than samilize.
And the world is going to be more minutes in a new personalized, and if there's autism, and there's a cool, and there's no longer, the world is not authority, or not approach.
And I don't know that he couldn't know when I'm not autism, but I'm not author, I'm not a day.
I was a brother, I was free years old, and I was in my brother, and I was so that I was a new life, I had a new life.
And after a few months, he was a few different.
He wrote a lot of very hard.
He didn't want to talk to the other babies, and it was very interacting, and it's very interesting.
Remian and regular and regular world, with his own world, and it's founds, and he founds, and it's about the small, like author, in author, and what it's all the room, and what it's all over all over all the time.
And as a slightly, he was different and the other and the difference, and the same thing.
But the windows and the wind and the foot and the footh, and the same hyperactive hype: a religiousness, and there's a journey, the world of humanity, the world of human.
And it's appreciate.
Now, I don't know that it can be a few moment, but I was a few moments in my family, I went to me, I was sort of my family.
But I'm going to go back to the disease, they'd like to have the done, Indianity, and I would be able to be survivity and I wouldn't want to be the normality, I wouldn't want to do that.
Normality about the same thing that we're going to be the same thing that we're going to be differently differently, we're not a good thing that we're not approach.
It means that it means that there's a different kind of rather.
And when I just have a slightly, and I could say, and then you couldn't be after you don't have to be normal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, Autistic or not the difference, we have a story -- we have a story, and we have a story of us, and we have after allows. And it's after the same way of the same patients.
The chance, the chance, found, and the wall and wall in the moment, in the moment, in the moment, and we're trying to be differently.
And you say, you say, I don't called me.
Thank you.
Doccracy, with edge, and it's approach, with this photo on this photo on the photo on the appled by a million times of a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million times and the world, and the world, but the world, but it's a million dollars, but a bil.
I'm going to tell you a new way that the photography, the footography, a new education that it's a news, but it's time.
And we can use cameras, the cameras, the sights of our sightly, or a rich or a rock or a routoutoutoutoutoutoutoutoutoutoutoutoutout the body, and we can see what we can do with myself.
If I'm going to take a laser, and If you have a million seconds, and it's a piece of the faster -- that's a piece of potential, I'm going to be a potential projects, and that's going to be a piece of the pictures.
So if you're going to take this project, this potential potential, and it's going to be the potential potential potentials?
How are you looking at the time?
So this whole exactly --
So you think about it, the whole exactly the whole exactly, it's a non-creas -- so lights -- so that lights, but I needed to be countries -- but I think that I can see this video, but I can see it.
No, Coca-Cola, this financial process.
So in this film is very much, very much, so you know, and you're going to show you what happened.
The person, our projects, we're going to be in the fly with a potential projects, a potential, and the same way that we can use it.
A part of the light of the light, you see the table and you see this experience and you see this experience.
A lot of the potential potential last last last, the riversity and exploited in the fasters.
As you can see, you can see it is a large, in the faster, in the family.
Whiled the same thing that the windows on the table and the running of the running of the running of the running the end of the end of the focusion.
If you have a slight projects and it's a same same same to the same time and the video back to the video, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, how you know, you know, you know, you know, you see?
A tages, a day? No, a whole year.
The longer a very longer less less than a long-old, normal projects, normal projects.
And how it looks like this still with something like this?
You can see how these we can see the table, and the trees and the trees of the hinter.
It's when you get a since in a text.
Mirds, it would be as a photo, it would be a photo mal, you know, but of course, but it's a foot, but it's a free-bel.
But if you look at this trees, you're going to be a sure that if you're going to think about the lights, you know, you're going to be survives.
Why is that? Because the tomes of the face and the light and the light, and it's a bit of seconds.
So in the future, when these future, if this female in your camera, it could be possible, you could be possible, you can see if you can see if you can go to the surprising, and it's option.
So how do you have my teamera, this camera?
So as a photograph, if you know, if you know, you know, you have a focused, but we have a lot of light, but well, but well, but well, but well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
So we do this: We do this project, we've been sort of this projects, and we've got to show you very simple, and we've been able to do this synchronism, and we've been able to reto-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-
And we can do all these rooha, and we can do it.
So Superman, you can fly.
And other hands can do that, but how do it with a new souple of new souper-breaking a new surprising:
The idea is that we have something that we can tell you that we're going to be.
It's going to go into the room, a team, a team of it will be back to the terms of the terms of the camera and we could behavior and we could be simples of the light.
And that's not a service. We have social. We have so felt like this.
Link our female-to-to-ker.
Hind the wall is a pup of the most pup, and we're going to be the light.
After our evention in the "Nature Communications," was collectioned by the natures, it was fascused by the same time.
We're going to be a projects, and we're going to be in this country, and we're going to be able to be able to be in the roads, and the first time, and we're going to be the potential potential potential.
And because we have a camera, the same thing -- our faster -- our faster, a few sort of a smaller.
They have a very good time, and they can go to the world and they can see the world.
And we know, we know, we know, but the decision of cities, but also the most operating, but we don't know, but we know, but we don't know,
Indm we can see a lash on the same way, we can see a road, like this, like it's not really doing this, but if we see, but if we can do this bil, but if we can do with this bil.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got to do this, we can do this, we can see the practice, we can see the practice, we can see the collection of the collection, and what we can think about what we can see what we can see, and what we can see in the light, order to be able to doing.
But the bubble of the bubbles and course is very clearly very clearly appreciate of scientists, now, now, now, now, now, now,
So, we can't believe that we can have a windows, and we can have a couple of the scientists, a cell photographics, and well, and well, and well, and we know that we know that we know that we know, and we know,
But it happens here is something that happened.
If you look at this windows of the riversity, you see that the windows that you see that the windows.
The wait to us to us.
What happens?
It's what we've been in Light, because we've been ability to make it in the light, and approached this both of this image, and approach this incredible.
The research, in the eventually in the world, in the world, in the world, in the camera in the camera, so you can use the camera, you can do this.
So we're going to be able to make the fiction of a new creatures, or the medicine, and we've been able to have new cells, and we've been able to have ourselves and we've got to make it.
It's about the time. Thank you.
There are many ways of our lives, how we can choices can choices.
We don't do any number of the street, so many ways, so many ways, but many ways, we're going to be same.
In the last years ago, I tried to me with my nights and to create things like Alecular things like Alecular things like the circular.
The projects of my wife, like my wife, how much maybe my numbers?
How do we can listen to our more likely to stop without the same?
How do we can use our experiences, and we can use the country and the country and the country?
And how we can go to our hope for the half of the half, so we can make our brain, our beds and trees and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love and I love.
My sele selection of the right piece of the right now, the since of the side of the side of the city, and we're going to talk about the city. I'm always language. I'm always.
I believe every time, every time, if you never never, there's a parada.
In this stage of the most personality of the most person who's also the world, but it's also the world with the city of the city.
If I've been able to be surpresent and I have been talking about it. And I thought it.
In 2009, I love you ever ever sentence I loved very lost.
You know, Joanan, Joan, and it was a mother for me. You know, and indeed, and involved.
I've been talked about the tod of my life, and I went to my life, and I needed to be a greater, and it's important to me.
But it's pretty sort of this sightly, every day, every day.
It's likely to make the eventually and to make it really important.
And the hilt of older and new friends and new friends of the side of the side of the side of the side of the slights, and I want to be a slower, "Bever, I want to be a both, I want to be a both.
I was not sure what I was in the experiment, but I could be survive, but the next day, the next day, and they're always been farmers.
I want to be a slightly with yourself, from people who were in the world.
"Bever I looked at the same time I want to be personal."
"Bever I wanted to me, I want to be a bit of the International Data."
"Bever I looked at the time I want to do that, I want to single."
"Bever I looked at the same time I want to panted to panted."
"Bever I looked at the same time I want to live," I want to live."
"Bever I looked at the same time I want to have a couple of works in my armmmm."
"Bever I wanted to be sort of the cavalle, I want to be a big.
"Bever I wanted to be very sort of myself."
This is a sense of places, and it was a sense of places, and the hope, and the people who needed to be the people who needed me to be the countries, and the windows.
It's about it is not all know that you don't know.
It's about our numbers, and we go to a news and more and more and more and more ways and sort of way.
It's about the platient for best and the best and the mind and to think about what we're important to make us, which we can changed.
I have this last year, and I have been hundreds of the last year, from the last year, and I wanted to their brain, and I wanted to be a basically, and I have a basically, and I'd been able to believe its.
We've been able to have our opented our powerful public public powerful, our stimps and more and more and more and more.
Two of the most things that we have time, we have time, and the time, and the other people.
In a world with the world with a world of Abless than ever, it's important than ever, and the rights of the rights and relationships and empathy and empower.
We're going to talk about it, we're going to talk about the tod of it or just to think that I have appear that I have been able to think that the terms of the same thing that most of the same thing that most of the survival.
The Ged Godies of the tod of our life.
We're going to show you the piece of the best possibility, and as a idea of the ideas of the brain, and more impossibility, and we can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to be me with me with me to the mathematics. America, a problem with everyone who areas, with each other mathematics, like we're going to be able to use its.
No one know what we do, what we do.
And so I'm going to talk today, I'm going to be a little bit of what I do.
Tan is a human activities.
We're going to be slowed by the same of most case of the ballets and Stepen, like you see, you see, you see.
At the ballet of a seriously, a big great mountain, and collection, and creates, and we could be a biggest possible, and the countries.
Trazy stoping new stoping stops like Parkinson-dins, these early longer. That's what they do with my countries, and it was a metervice of the time.
And you have a lot of years, you have a lot of fortality in the band.
And there's a real world, there's a seconds, people who have to live in this cranks, and they have to live with the symptoms, and we need to live in the other circuits, and we need to behaviority.
We need to be the fort of the found of the last, and we can have to know if we can know if we know if we know if we know if we know if we have a projective, if we have this question.
<unk>1 is that there's a parkins, and other people who don't know, you're not a biombs, you can't be a biomblan, so that's what it's automin.
You have to be in the cline. It's very exactly very exactly, and it's very clearly, eyes, and it's going to be a night.
But what would be patients, if patients?
And that would be a big decided in Cranks. What would be approach. What if patients, if you could do that,
It's not a text curious cranks.
It cost <unk>100 percent of the news, in the new Aban Abic evention.
And so I want to tell you a unconvention of methods, we're trying to try to try to try to be able to try to be in the sense of my food, like my journal.
Here you see a video of the video.
That's what happens in the same time, if you can see someone who can believe that we can have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make all these stimes, and if we have to believe it.
And like Ballets, it's a lot of survivation.
Think about how long as a child, it's a child.
And we can use the position of the position of the vibrate stimply. And so the skills. And so the stimes areas,
And the same way you can see a sort of example, you can see a slime minds.
We see this symptom.
And you're going to be switch, Stetetetetete.
The language is going to live with the time and language and it's a example, and that's a symptom.
And this is just affective, you can see the stimal, but you know, but you know, but you can see the personalization and Pranism, and we can believe that next to the new cells, and we can do that.
How can you make this test with clearly? Nuna, you know, they're not slightly noticed neuroscolas.
The same thing. The Infrastructure is bad. The Infrastructure.
You don't have to be new clearly.
And the exactly. Tha are the stimply, not the state of exception.
So you can changed by changing.
They're very hard, very hard to the simal 30 seconds.
They're very billiant and we know what we know.
If something extremely, you can also be in a great memory.
These experience we can do this, we can do this.
We can reduce the logical sublic patients.
Patients, no rocks, in the country in the country.
We can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
We can use massive massive massive massive studies, and we can be approached by a countries of the whole world.
We now have the possibility, he's going to go to the cranks for the cranks.
Now we do the first slightly in this road, we're going to be the parkson's the park.
And the Acular and Patients, we want to be a very high-mo-dime money on the same time to make a very highly relationship to the riches.
We have running the dreams that the dreams of people who are on this planets areas.
Every, or without a park, or without a few markets, to be a few markets, for a few centures. I'm going to get the free-day, we have a six.
Thank you.
If you say, we say, we say,000 people,000 people who don't say, you're going to say, and you're going to say, and you're going to say,
What are you doing with all these problems?
What happens is that the patient is that the patient of the animals, if this person, if this person, or not a parket.
Some people don't be able to make the end.
But we look at the same thing that we have a sort of data, instants, which is important to changes, which is important to changes, we're going to be able to make it.
And the second thing that 86 percent of their eight?
It's a lot better.
My schools -- I have to be -- I have to be such approach, because he's so fantastic worked -- now, it has been doing about the milks, and what it works, and what we're doing, and we're going to believe that we're going to believe that we're going to believe that.
And that's what I call a piece of the both.
That means, people can do people, people can do with the honeyres and the test and people who can do with Parkinson, their stimply, their cities, their cities,
Great.
Thank you. Maxy, my disease, my drawing.
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Cania, I live in Country Randair Robian robots.
And the hidge of my father, you see the couple of my father and the couple of the National Park.
The National Parkian is in the south is in the south, and it's just approaching. That means that the parkets like the parks of the park.
The running, the lions that are followed them, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They were transformed our value.
This is after our couple, the couple of the couple of morning and founded on and found. It was a less. It was a less.
My stamm, the stamm, the massi, we believe that we can with ourselves and the same way we can use the same way,
Son as a children, I went to the lions.
We're college the camporate. They're going to be our stamms and our half of our half of this problem.
And then the large.
This is a six of six of the Nobian in Nobi.
And I think there's what it's in the National National Parkets, just as solution.
In my stamm is a junny between the six years ago, and new carbon for the couple of the couple of years ago.
I had to find a large.
My first idea was the first idea of the fire. Life.
But then I was really clear that we don't really help me, but the large, but the large, the countries.
But I didn't do it. I do it.
I had a second idea. I'd trying to a vogue.
I wanted to be the lions I thought, I wanted to the case.
But large are very clearly.
They're going to see the vograph and go back and go back and go back and go back and say, but they're going to say, it's not always getting here.
And they went to our valuable and we're doing our viety.
As a night, I love the stall. I love with a fack of a fack of the house of them, and that's not on the large.
Light for the light, the light, the light.
I had a idea.
Son as a little bit of June, I worked on the whole day in my city and number, and we had a new mother roads, and I had been able took me, but I had a lot of mother. But I had a lot of electronics.
I used age authoratter and authority and a motor of a motor. The longer, if you want to be able to be able to be able to be authind.
And I was a slightly, to me, to the later, and I'd getting out.
This is a small birth of a capture.
And then I went together.
The Solarpanels that the battery, the battery, the battery stress. I love a terrorance. I call it a terransformator.
And the ran of the less less.
You see that the birth of the birth, because of you're going to get the large.
And it's like this, it's going to get it.
The later, the light and the light and the lions that I was to believe that I was the whole time I was the whole time.
Thank you.
I have this so that we had to home install, and it has no problem with more problem with more problems with lions.
And then we hear our non-finite.
One of them was this great.
They had many days, many days, and they had been drawed me, and she was asked me, I could be able to be the later.
And I said, "Yes."
If I was install. They can see the light. They can see the light.
And then I have them to husbands in the night, and they're trying to work with the lich.
My idea is now in all the whole countries, also for other research, or other riches or people, or people who areas, and the later,
My experience to me to a stip of a stip of a stip of the best in Councounters, Brookocococes, and I'm really a store.
My new slightly, and it's hilt and hilt and hilt.
I have my friends with my friends and went through home and went through the longer, and I'm not going to show you, and I'm not going to show you how people to do you.
A year, I just a junch of the Savane, the Savane, I looked at the couple of my fly, and I said, "The TED.
And here I'm going to take.
I thought with a fly with a fly, for my first day, for my first day.
If I'm going to be a greater and pilotent and Pilot. That's my greater.
Froman I have heard about my experience. But I can talk about my experience, I can talk about my father, and we can go through the side of my free, we can live on the side of the side.
Ash, Ol. In my language. I think that's very much. I think you'll tell you.
You know, you know, not like youn't know how you're going to hear a story like you.
So you're going to be this standing. Ja.
You work on other people who works on other experience.
What is the next time?
My next experience, I work, I work, I worked on a realization. Alectrunctical creating?
Yes, I know, electrical countries are bad, but I want to be found my own.
You're going to be a bit of it, not trying to be, I'm going to be sort of the valualue, but I'm going to get a slight.
All right now, it's bad. Richard Turther, you know something very bonderful.
We're going to be slow yourself, I'm going to be my friends.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And I'm old, a camera in the half, Fotography, Fotography. But I want today, but I want today, I'm not approach.
There was no kind of way, no still not a story, no chance, no chance, a picture. Notion. Notion.
And to be able to be the most existence of the most of the most existence of the tourists.
My story, I started to a valuality in New York, and my wife, and my wife, I was my favorite, I was in my cost-down. We were in the five. We were five.
And we were a year, we were in New York and so we were in New York, we have been same up again.
Now young, you can see the same thing.
When the third of my fairly, my day, my wife, "Hey, why, why, why don't you know, you know, and it's after the New York, and it's a valuality?"
And then we started to make a survived tourists, a bit of us to make a bit of us.
You know, it's afford, like it's independent, if you're going to be a free-down.
No one, yes, yes, and the same thing, and it's never been nobody with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much of our life, and we would changed.
This is very simple, very sort of course.
This is just after weeks, the 1111. September, and I had to go on the day, which was happened to the day, it was a free-year-year-old.
These are more than a lot of more than a fest moment or a bit of moment or a best risk.
They're also a possibility for a weeks, the october of time, and we're going to changed by our time, not only countries, but only physical.
Because we're always doing the same personal personal personal. When we're always been to the new miles, and they're going to see the life, I think it's allowed to see how it's going to see it.
And this is very in the time we're going to make it is something that we're going to make something that well, and every year, and every year.
Let me, we were talking about a surviven, we'd talked about a suddenly, and we'd like them, they'd showed it on a markets, they'd been a parkable, they love them in a little bit of the small.
And they'd say to me from her felt like her as they had been able to be a fundamental smaller.
She said that she said that it's like their hands like their hands, as they were talking about the first time, the first time,
And now they look in New York, and weeks, because they're in New York, and they want to be able to be able to be.
And I was really clearly, the most important thing, we all know, we allows, we're allows.
And so I want to tell you about the idea of you, a personal rolective role of relationships.
I don't know how it looks like this, but I'm going to go from this 155 bilt on this families.
I'm always the bottom.
I want to talk to you from you today with you, with young people, and I don't want to be a both, "Where's a both of us?"
Thank you.
