When I was 11 years old, I was 11 years old, I was brightly high-old.
My father heard about his little, gray, gray, the new radio the message of BBC.
He looked very happy, very happy, which was pretty unusual, because it was pretty depressed.
He called "The Taliban are walking away!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father obviously, very happy.
"Yes, you can go to a real school," he said," he said.
I'm not going to forget about it.
Actually, a real school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and they brought it was girls to school.
And so I was switched with five years, I five years, and I started my older sister, my older sister, who didn't come from the sister shoes.
And so we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we couldn't take a different way to get a different way to get a different way.
We've hidden our books in the moment to sell it looks like this, we'd just going to go to the sell.
And we were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small to a small painting room.
In the winter was available, but incredibly hot.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
And over again, the sudden, the suddenly for a week, because the Taliban, because the Taliban,
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Does they were us?
Who do they know where we live?
We had afraid, but we wanted to go to school.
I had great fortunate in a family, in education as important as important and daughters.
My grandfather was his time.
And one outside a certain provinced province Afghanistan. He was sending his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and it was done.
My basically, my mother was teacher.
That's what it is.
Two years ago, she went to the ruhest in the house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this was the first in his family, who was ever received a school.
And for him, it was a clear that his children would be an education, but also his daughter, despite the taliban, despite all the risk of all the risk of all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk of his children don't look at school.
I know exactly that I was in the Taliban sometimes in the Taliban sometimes, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective sense.
I was a good luster, but my father said, "Thather said, "Thather, you can lose to your life.
Your money can be carbon. You can be remove your house.
But one thing is going to stay in your stay, which is what's going to stay with our blood for your blood for your blood for your blood for your blood, we're going to do that.
So -- you're still going to still be up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that's been destroyed by decades.
Less than 6 percent of the women of my age, a higher than the second, and if my family, and if my family wasn't so strong for my factor, I would have a significant, I would have one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proudlebsolventin of the Middlebury College.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was involvator who was taken by his family, because he was sending his daughters to school.
He doesn't just practice with my high school, but also I was the first woman, and I'm, and I'm, and I'm, and I'm going to drive it.
My family believes me.
I have a big dreams, but my family has greater dreams for me.
So I'm global message, I'm global message for 10x10, a global campaign for the education of women.
And so I've helped to give SOLA, and maybe the first internative and maybe some internat for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls still for girl.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school with great earliers with great ears, all of them would be true.
And to see how their parents and fathers and fathers for her parents, and I'm going to be my parents, and despite all the way.
So as Ahmed. That's not his face, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
About a month, his daughter, and heim on the home of SOLA in her village, and they're the side of the streets of the roads.
When he was in the home, he sounded the phone, and a voice, and he sent him, he sent to school, he would sent its daughters.
And he said, "Till kills me when you want to sit down, but I'm not going to sit down the future of my daughters on your daughters and overhelming.
What Afghanistan, I realized something like this, I realized something that's often in the West, most of us, most of us, most of us, the success, the value of his daughter, and the value of his daughter, and it's success.
That's not hotters that our mothers don't play in our success.
And they're highly highly the ones that are starting to convince the future, and they're in a society as a society like the in a society like the in Afghanistan, the invisible.
And we were just a few hundred girls to school -- because it was a hundred girl -- because it was the illegal.
But today, but today, three million girls over three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how we're such changes.
I'm not sure that the changes are not by during the Abzugs of the United States.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I'm a students in my schools, and their parents that they're going to be a lot of parents that they're going to be a lot of future, and I see a lot of future and a long time.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unlimities, and the unlimities, and I remember every day, and the girls, the SOLALAALAALAALAALAALAAALALA.
And just like I have a big dreams.
Thank you very much.
Everything I do, also, even my life -- my life -- my life -- my life, and I was in Africa as young man.
In 1971 to 1977, I'm looking like, I'm not -- I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Kenya, algeries and Somalia, algeries and Somalia, algeria,
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project that we put on the legs we've been on the legs.
I was turned.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people and good people are good working in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we were all we're starting to do.
Our first project, which is my first book called Ripples, "Ripples of the Zambi," inspired by the way that we wanted to show how food is built to show how food.
We came with Italian Saatgut in South South South South Sambia, which leads to Sambesi flying talent of the south of the south of the south of the south of the tomata and zucin.
Of course, the answer to the antsolutely no interest in it, so we pay for working for the work, and sometimes they were doing it.
We were amazing that there was no country in a so economy.
But instead of asking why they didn't look at what we're just saying "God, thank you, thank you.
"Great, it's right now to save people save people saved in front of the collection."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, we had this practice, they were so big, they were so big, they were so big.
We couldn't believe it and said, "Look, and we said, "Look, like simple country."
When the tomates were red, and red, about night, about 200 night, and they were wondering everything.
We said to the Sambian: "Oh God, the Nilp food.
And they said, "Yeah, we don't have a country here."
"Why didn't you told us?" "You've never asked us."
I just thought we were so great, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did what the Englands, what the Englands, what the French, and then I saw what they did.
We felt the fifth of the food.
You should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainly, and you shouldn't see anything.
They should read the book "Thead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyoyo, it's a sambic economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've got the African continent 1.5 trillion Euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been doing this money.
Lesp just read them.
Lespond to a African, which we've been on.
We western people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, and we're just two species, and we're patriarchal.
Both words come from the latinical root, which means "pather" means "Father" means.
But they have two different meaning two different meanings.
Patriarchalical: I'm treating everyone each one other culture, they'd love you to my children.
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone each one other culture, they were my service.
So this is white people are called people in Africa, Chef, Chef, Chef,
I was growing up when I was a book called the book "Small is the book," by summary, especially in the economic sky, then they don't want to leave them in the back.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
Today, the morning of the morning that conference, and asked, a stab, and asked, "Can you imagine a city, don't you imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react with people, and he was a system called companies, and they're going to be initiated with the nobody, no one's going to be motivated, but you're going to be the destroyeds of the passenger pion of the pion that the destroying pion of the pion
What you do -- you do -- you're going to be the mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you're going to set up with the sky.
We don't work from office.
We make us in Caf<unk>s. We meet us in Caf<unk>s.
We have no infrastructure.
We finally finally found, and find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out what the person want to find out.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give someone else.
If these persons don't like to do?
The passengment for the person is the most important growth.
The passengment for the passenger is the most important of humanity.
We help them find that knowledge because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea hasn't knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this instead of starting to say, why, and people who are going to hear what they should do, why don't we hear them in communities.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with communities.
And we never have never been part of the time, and they're never going to tell what they want to tell their money to see what they're going to see what they're seeing.
Planation has this blind fluid.
The closest people of the community of the community, because they never seem to be public meeting.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new profession has to be created.
This is the house of the companies of the business of the bed, who's house, who's in your caf<unk> sitting in the caf<unk> sitting in the cafully, your passion in a way to transform your passion in a way to transform your passion.
I tried this in its basically trying to try to do this.
I was promoved in time and tried to get out of time and trying to get out where we're going to do what they should do.
And so I went through the first year, and I had a street and had three days, and I was going to help me. I him. He was called him. He was Maori. I was Maori. I him, and I was morize in Perthers.
I think that fisheries, and I'm going to work with these wonderfish thunfish thunfish, and I didn't help us to sell us, but after 15 dollars, but after 15 dollars. Then you know, and they said, "Holy.
In a year, I had 27 projects. The government, and the government, "How do you do that?
How do you. I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and hope."
So -- -- -- So, the government, "Make it again."
We've done it in 300 communities.
We've got 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are involved in a sense.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, one of the story, starting with 96,
Peter pressor was philosophy professor, before he was businessor, and Peter said, Peter said, Peter said, planning in reality, in reality and the reality and the economy."
Planation is the death is the death of the entrepreneurs.
So you build Christch, without knowing what the classifying human cold, and their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get this to get to a care.
You have to give them discretion and privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them to help them, and they're going to be hard.
In a community of 10,000 people getting 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
And for what presentation is, you've been in the most applaud tomorrow?
<unk>respective, they have applications. They have applause.
And I want to say that entrepreneurs are the right way.
We're on the end of the first industrial Revolution -- night, nights, fossil fossil fuels, and suddenly, and suddenly, and systems that are not sustainable.
The connection of powerful machine is not sustainable.
The Freon-Arts of instandable.
We need to look at how we need to look at seven billion people on sustainable ways, holds, holds, and we can transport them with them.
The technologies are not existing for that.
Who will this technology for the green revolution? Universities? Universities?
The government? Can you're approach.
It's going to be entrepreneurs.
I read a terrible story in a futuristic magazine.
There was a group of experts that were invited in the future of the city of New York in 1860.
In 1860, they came together, and speculated in 100 years with the city of New York, and the city was a pursuit of New York, the city of New York,
Why? They saw the curve, and they said, if the population in this tempoint in this tempo further, they needed six million paths to be six millions of six millions of six millions of six millions of path.
Because they went to the mistakes.
1860, they see the bad technology that life from New York,
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, in 19001, in the United States -- 1001.
The idea, another technology, a different technology, the race. There was tiny little factory in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
And first, first, first of all, they need to be retion.
And they don't come to you, and they're talking to you.
And next thing you have to do is absolutely powerful service and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the smallest company, all of the smallest company, three things that need to be selling. That's got to be selling, the market, the market, and the financial and the financial and the financial.
Do you want to guess?
We never met a single person who can be selling a little person who can sell you something like the money, and we're going to care about the money.
It's not exists.
This person was born.
We've been looking at the 100 iconic companies, and we looked at the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Edison, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, G
There's only one thing that all successful companies have been in common, just one: No one: No one: No one person.
Now we teach them, we teach 16-year-olds in Northumberlands, and we started to give them the first two sides of Richard Branson Autobiography. The first two-olds. The first two branches.
Nobody, "ich" and 32 times "wir" and 32 times.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody was a company, a company. No one. Nobody.
So can we create a community, in the middle of the middle of a smaller, in Caf<unk>s and Bars and Bars and Bars. The bars. They're going to do what someone who's going to do with you.
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you sell the money?
"Oh, no, no, I can't you." "Well, you know that I'm going to finish?"
We activate communities.
We've just been able to support the companies that are consumed by volunteers, and we're going to help them to help people. We've found that the wonder of the intelligence of the intelligence of the intelligence of the intelligence, and the economy, and the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be, as it must be in the wonderland.
The Penn State University, a Doccentination -- a Doccent in communication -- increasing engineering in communication.
I had fears.
Rightfare. Fear. Fear of these students with their great brains, and their books and their books, and their books, and their books.
But when the conversation, the conversation, it was like Alice, when they looked down to the Caninles, and a door and a door, and a door.
And I felt like I was felt when I was talking about the students, I was amazing. I was amazing about the thought they were discovered that they had discovered that they were discovered.
I think to open up these door, I think it's great communication.
We need incredible communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the ones that our biggest problems, like the energy, and when we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it. I don't think it's nothing in our responsibility.
But these great conversation, if our scientists are not in our scientists and engineers and engineers.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, please.
I want to show you a few anti-time, how to see that we can see that the science and the technology and technology, and the technology, sexy and spaneously.
The first question that you have to answer is, is, is, right?
Say, why we're just sort of scientific areas of scientific area.
Don't just suggesting that you can study, but also tells us that you're also treating us that you can treat us, because it's important structure, because it's important to understand oases, and to treat it.
And if you do that, what you do is you do is you, then you're going to be avoided.
After a hearing a hands of your minds.
Surely, you could use your doctors, and pretty, but why don't you say, why don't you say, "Raum and time, what is much understanding for us?
Our thoughts, we understanding, it's not the same as their nive same as their nive.
As a country said, "Mache's just as simple as possible -- but not easier."
You can tell us something about you, something about your scientific areas of scientific area, without to tell you.
Some things are involved in this, examples, examples, stories and analogies.
And if you're working on your work, then the stories, then the stories.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stichpoint"?
What happens when someone else is going to be else? Another will be the first time, and with these points, and with these points.
A follows like this is not just long, but it's also language, but also too much on the language of our brains, and so we're setting.
This example of geneview of genevieve Brown is much effective. It's much effective structure of the trabele of the trabele of the trabeledge that it was so stable design of the eggggggarian design of the eggggggggg.
The trick here is to use a single simple simple sentence, which is what it's going to read the audience, orientation, orientation, orientation, orientation, orientation, and graphics that are also reading our other senses, and it's a deeply drawing a deeper and it.
These are just a few answer that can help us to see these door, and the wonderlands and the wonderlands, and the technology and technology.
And the engineers I've been teaching me, I've been taught me to make me," with the <unk>Nerd in me, I want to make anything with a same with a same with a same.
And you can see, in your science, and your stories, and your multiple, and your relevance, so that's important, so the audience, and multiple, and multiple, and multiple, and it's incredible works.
So scientists and engineers and engineers, if you're solved me, it's sounds me unprected me.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handyridge, you can films of humanity in Syria.
With a handy, you can tweet a message in Egyptian and a protestaction in Egyptian.
And with a handy, you can take a song, it's high-loud and famous and famous.
All of this is possible.
I'm in 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in those city.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people, and the streets on the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989 and imagine that all these people who had all these people who had involved on the pockets, a handy in the pocket.
Who in Saala, a handy on the same?
Hold it up.
Hold your hand phones, you're high!
Hold it up. One is a Blackberry, a blackberry,
These are many nearly everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and I've changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 cells.
Roh data.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.Kommission a direction.
This direction is called Rightline is the reline to the currently.
And this direction is that every phone calls every phone calls Europe, every Internetdia, every Internetdia, a bandwidth of the world.
Who is it going to be? Who sends up with a email?
Who shortly, who sends a text?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
And all of these information are going to be six months to two years to two years of your phone or your phoney or your phoney or your Internetanbieved.
And everywhere in Europe, and people said, "This is, we don't want to do it."
They said, we're going to do this board significantly.
We don't want to be self-dimension in digital age, and we don't want to be the phone and Internet, and we need to store all these information about us.
There were an applies, Journalists, Priester, who said, "This is, we don't want to say, "This is not going to want to say, "This is not."
And here you can see how 10,000 people on the streets of Berlines and said, "Freedom, and said, "Freedom.
And some people said, some people would be the stasi 2.0.
The state was the secrets in East.
And I'm asking me if that's really working.
Can you really all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone called my phone called Germany telecom that was the largest telephone, and I asked her, and I asked them, and I asked them all information, and I asked them all information that you've been talking about me.
And I asked them, and I asked them, and I didn't get a real answer.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life, because it's my life.
So I decided to get a point of viewing, they wanted to have this information because I wanted to have this information.
But the Germany telecom said, no, we're going to give you this information.
And at the end, it came to a compared to them.
I'm going back to the terms of what they're all sending me.
Because in the twish of the mouth, the mouth of the E.U.
So I got this half of this half of the half of a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 columns information.
First, I saw it, and he said, it's a huge datei.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this dial.
So I was a little bit skeptic, what should I start with it?
Because you see where I'm where I'm, where I'm sleep.
But then I said, I want to go to the public information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show what I want to show what it means.
So with time online and open data City, I've data City.
This is a visualization of six months.
You can reincooms and out and out and out and out and back and back and back.
You can do any step that I do, you can do.
And you can see how I can see how I'm going to see how many tasks with the trains, and how many calls, and how many calls.
And it's possible to this information.
This is a little bit of a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First of all, it's just like, and I called me, and we're talking about a few times with each other.
And then I called me a few friends, and they call them apart.
And after a while you call you and you call up and you call this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they're going to go to bring another time to bedrooms, when they go to bed.
You can see all this.
You know, you're going to recognition, like the leaders, like the leaders are the group.
If you have access to these information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect definition of how to redesign a society because you know who's talking to who talk to who are talking about who is possible when you're possible when you have access to these information.
And these information are going to be six months, at least in Europe, in Europe.
As I started to start thinking that all these people in the streets in the streets in the street in 1989 cell phones in her pocket.
And the stasi, the state, who had been in the demonstration of the demonstration, and if the stasi, and if the leaders are never happened.
The case of the mountain mountains might not have founded.
And even though, the case of the ice of the ice.
Because today, because of the information and companies like so many information, like they want to get over us, like they can get over us, online.
They want to follow the possibility, and they want to be popularly long species.
But even when it's a life in digital time in digital age of digital age.
But you have to fight for self-certainly,
You have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you say, you're friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old-century.
If you go home, you say, you're going to have your birth, because companies and state the possibility, they have to store information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you're asking your phone calls information that they've seen over you've seen.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you're using your handy, you remember the self-certainly, you have to fight into digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituosens, fastrestaurants, breaks, breaks.
So the city planer, and so survive, and the name South Central South Central to change it, so it's changed him in South Los Angeles, when that's going to change what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituitude, fastrestaurants, breaks, breaks.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food, I live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the home of the Driva and the drive-bys.
The comic best is that the drive-thrus more people killed than the drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles,
The fatty is in my fourths, in my fourth, five times higher than about 15 kilometers, which is about 15 kilometers.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me, asked me how you wouldn't have access to healthy food when you'd have access to the house, if you go out of the house, the negative effects that's best effects the best earth.
I'm going to buy roletal sells and sellings like buying basis.
I see dialysiscyseconds like Starbucks like Starbucks.
And I realized that this is that this has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no luster, I had no lustered in 45 minutes to get appledge to get appledge that's not with pesticides.
So I plant a food week, I was a food.
It's a piece of country that we call parkanles.
It's 45,000 feet.
The thing is, the thing is, it's the city.
But you have to pick it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to kep it in stands."
And I decided to hold it in stands.
So I came up and my group, and my group, and we started together, and we started to plant my food, and we started plants, and the same program, so that's all the program, so that's all the program.
We're a kind of prediction group, and we're used together from all social stories and from all the city, it's completely free, and everything we're doing, and everything we do, is cost.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone's been decided.
The city came up to me and he came up with me, and he said that I had told me that I need to relaime, and he said that I had to be a richer.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A richeral regular remote controls on a piece of food that's not a piece of land, is not a dead?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her."
Because this time, it wouldn't go to it.
The L.A. Times, Winds, Steve Lopez Lopez Lopez, and talked to the city of Green Green ground. They were a petition. They were a petition on Change.
We thought in the hands.
My city rather rather than and said that she said that they're supporting and love what we do.
So why should they do that?
L.A.A. in the United States, most breaks in the city of the city.
They're six miles of breaking breaks.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flower to plants to plants to plants.
Why would they find that, why don't you find that?
And by the construction of a plant, you get 1,000 sample.
With boat, within a dollars in the value of a dollars in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my holy, I'm going to build their own food.
His own food is like to build your own money to pressure.
Look, I have a confuse in South Central.
I grew up there. I went there. I've been pulled up there.
And I'm sort of this, part of this previous reality that was made by other people who were made by other people, and I was fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I plant my art.
And just like a graffiti coasts, the walls, the walls, I'm beautiful, I'm a parkanles.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of pieces, and the trees are my dreams for these stuff.
They would be surprised what the earth, if you can use it as a legs.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunlums is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I experienced how my gardens to a instrument for the relationship and the relationship.
To change the community, you have to change the collection of the ground.
We're the ground.
They'd beautiful as children are going to be influenced by children.
Garden is the therapists, and the most careful act, especially with the city.
And you get Earthquake Earthquake.
I remember this time when these mother, when these mother, and her daughter, it was about 10:30. They were in my garden, and I came out, and I came out, and I came out.
I felt really bad, I felt bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I was like, when I saw people were looking at people who were so close to me, and I was just so close to do that, and that's what people are asking me, people are not afraid, you don't have fear."
And I said, "There's no fear, no, I don't have afraid.
And it's the street, it's on the street.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but I want to take it back to the same time, I want them to take their health."
And then, I was lived in this observed in this observed L.A.
These are the guy who have helped me to definitely.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it was affecting it, and how they've plants and how they've plants, and it was great, and it was great, and it was great for a moment.
Green reason for about 20 gardens,
To our environments came up within the same 50 people and they were all volunteers, and they're all volunteers.
If children carbon, it's eating children.
If they tumates, they eat.
But if they don't get anything about it when they're not shown when they don't get to the food and body and body and body and body, they're blind, they're blind them.
I see young people who want to work, but they're going to work in this thing -- I see in this thing -- I see in this thing that's exactly on the color that they're not looking at it.
The gardens, I see as a career, where we can train the children to care their communities to care their communities to lead to lead to lead to lead.
And if we do that, who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverververton Carverton Carverton Carvert
But if we don't change the collection of the Earth, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole hock of garden plants where people can share the same block.
I want to take shipscontainer and turn them into healthy caf<unk>s.
So, don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about costless, because free, because free, it's not sustainable.
The comic basically is that you have to be able to sustainability.
I'm talking about to people, people are working, and children from the streets, and they're going to get the streets, and the honor and the honor, and when you build their own food, and when you built their own foods.
So what I want to do is to do is to make this sexy.
I want to believe that we're all ecological rebell, gangster, gangster.
We need to turn the picture of gangsters.
If you're not a gangster, you're not a gangster.
Are you going to be selling with a sell, right?
And let's take the weapons of your choice.
If you want to meet with meeting, you don't want to make meeting in the caves, and you want to make a meeting, and a meeting, and you're talking about it.
If you want to meet meet meet you're going to get to my garden, so we can plant to plants to plants.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite songs in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster.
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "snollygoster," means "No inevitable politicians.
Although, even though, a magnitude a better definition, "Ein Snollygoster is someone who's a collygoster is someone who's an approach, program or lady, program or lady, and his success, and his success, and his success, and its.
I don't know what "speakeral" is.
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians know that they need to try to control the language.
For example, for example, thirdly, the British parliament, time, time, time, time, the skin.
And that was actually back to the mother was actually back to the mother of a man's extraordinary name Brass Crosby, who was crossssby,
She was him in the Tower of London, and he was a mutigrade, but he was mutigrade, he was mutigrating enough, and he was so much in London, he was so much in London that he was so much in London that he was won.
And just a few years later, we find the first news, we find the first news for the first message of Brass"
Brasses are reflecting on the English word for blech.
But that's not true. It's going back to a return to a press.
But to show you how words are slightly politics, I want to take you into the United States, I'm going to take you on the time they're just reached the independence.
You saw the question about how to say George Washington, the state of the state of the state of the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leadership of a republic nation?
And that's been debate in the Congressed.
And there were all sorts of possible for all sorts of possible.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernors, and others, and others, and others, and others, and other, and other, and other people's others of America's Whington.
Not so that's not a present.
Some people just wanted to call it King.
They thought that's been during that.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the kingdom.
It would have work.
But everyone was incredibly boring, because these debate three weeks,
I read the days of a senator that write stands, "Immerica.
The reason for the population, and the long twee the representation was that the representation was.
The representing house didn't want to be that Washington. They didn't want to do it. They didn't want to do it.
Canigating, and they're going to take it on ideas to be able to bring it.
They wanted to give him the most powerful, the most painful titled,
This title was "President.
President. They don't existed the title. He was existed. But he was suffering. But he's situation.
This is what the previously a jury.
He had no longer size, when the terms of "Ancils" or "Apasser."
Sometimes, there were president little colonial communities and governments and governments, but it was really an infective title.
So this is why the senat in the senat him.
They said, "This is smile, you can't call it president.
This guy has to be undermined and out of the countries and out of the countries.
Who will take it a seriously when he's a dumbl like President of the United Statesident of America?"
And also, after 3 weeks, the senat in the senat.
Instead, you know, the title of the title of the title of the collection of the collection of the collection of the case, but they didn't want to be able to repect the methods and methods and methods.
You can learn from three interesting things.
First, I think that's what I think about -- until now I don't have anything that the senatenates that the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title of the title. He was just being done.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says that something temporary -- -- -- then you were temporary.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point is that the title "President of the United States," isn't so sound so that's not so sounds, right?
This has more than 5,000 nuclear populars to do with the largest people who he's biggest people and the largest drones of the world and a photte drones, and this whole stuff.
And it's really given the title of the title.
And so the senat at the end of the end.
They've got a respectable title.
And the other senats, the other sense of the sense of property -- now it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the cling of clusters, like the 5,000 nuclear power.
So at the end, the senat and the representative and the representation, because no one is going to be a word that you're going to be the president of the United Statesident of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take with, and with.
Politicians trying to use words to control the reality and the reality, but actually changing the reality of reality, but actually changes the reality of reality, the reality of reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelling 50 rebelling a campaign to Diffalabad, from Jacksonvillegetaric surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I thousands of my black conversy half of a couple of latest country and celebration of the government of governments that I couldn't even see.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
Now, I was a long time, I was biggest, I was biggest pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama pieces and fights with rassical southern Southern Southern Cindrationalistic services, and religionalists, the <unk>embligionalists.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to stand up here, Southe, Southeast Afghane, Southeist and atheist and atheist and atheist and atheist and atheist, who's been born in Afghanistan, and it's been working in Afghanistanistanistanistanistanist
So there's a lot of great things that you could do with art, but I could do with art, but I don't like to make personal art, I want to make the personality, and I want to make the personality and authority and home today and home.
I want to spend a day in life of a dihad -- Gangster, who's going to spend his diction, like "Popstar Bling" and popstar Bling" and popular black in the political corruptions and political corruptions.
And what's going to do is to make the Dihad-Gangster than candidate and a choice and a choice with the slogan: "Well, I'm going to do with the Slogan: I'm rich."
And trying to use these campaign to device these magnitude that are campaigns that are being a national system.
And I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and they're going to take a project called "Rast," and they're going to be a policemist, a wrong control of cabulary controls, but in the streets of cabulating.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan, I went to my opinion to the "modic conflict,"
The war and the foreign and the foreign powerful settle, and they've created a new environment, and models that you can only collection for soldiers, by building a models and self-mocolds and self-interm.
And I'd like to see how a simple simple simple simple cabulation, and I think about 189, and to create a dialogue today, today, today, today, and they're going to be colonials in the colonial retaining.
But for all of these things, you can get into prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be missed.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to be because the geography of self-dofield.
That's my last. What is your last. What is your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since a time, I've been working as a model.
Since 10 years, right?
I have a sense that now in the room, in the room, because I didn't have a tension because I didn't have to start to reflect this clothes.
Fortunately, I've got something to the way.
This is the first time that you can see someone on the TED stage, you can see, you can tell you, so you can be happy to see.
If you were really excited about women, when I wasn't going to tell me that I don't need to twitter.
I also realized that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very shortly, because I think you're thinking about what you think about me.
And that's not everyone has the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to be such as well.
The hardest part is too line, the pullover over my head, because then you're going to be laughter, you're not going to do with my head.
In order.
Why did I do that now?
That was possible.
Now, it was hopefully as this picture.
And one image is powerful, but a powerful.
I've just changed your opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer, and I was so all my back and with my hand in the hair in the hair.
And then, from operations or the wrong bridge that I was going to change two days ago, there are just very few times, there are very few possibilities, and our extraordinary -- even though it's own lives, even though it's a big lives.
It's to be honest for me to be honest for me to be honest.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a hip, and I know, and in my break, and in my breaking a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always asking me to ask me to the real way.
The first question is, "How will you be a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means," but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, is a message in the genetic lottery and maybe you're asking, and maybe you're wondering what's going to be.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have beauty, well, and well-cost-centurymetrically defined, but we're biological programmed, but as biological, but also as biological, femin and highly highly.
This experience was created for me. And it's a required for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls.
And first of all, I'm going to comment. Steach. Very.
But unfortunately, I have to share that in 2007, a very suffer Doctorand of the NYU all the models on the running, every single one that was book, and that was book, and that was only 27 or less than four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the 6
The next question that will be asked me, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm a model?"
And first of all, I said, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls that I want to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be.
You can be presidentin of the United States or the inventor of the next Internets or a ninja-handerzy, which would be dead, because then you would be the first painting."
If they're still going to say, "No, no, no, no, no, I want to be a model," then I want to say, "Who's my head."
Because I don't have anything, and you couldn't be the chefrediction of American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next steven Meisel.
And you say that you want to be a model, you're going to say that you'd like to say that you want to win the Jackpotto the lotto.
You can't affect it, and it's not a career, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to give you 10 years, I'm going to give you 10 years, because of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart.
And if you're going to be a photograph, and you can see the lights, and then you're going to be a piece of cameron, and then we want to be a photo in the walk, and then you go to the legs, and then you go to the poor, this poor, and that poor, this poor, this poor, this poor, this poor
It looks like this.
Hopefully, it's less comic than that.
That was ... I don't know what's happening there.
If you're going to sleep a life, and a few jobs, and you can't be sorry, you can't be sorry, you're going to be presidentin of the United States, but in the United States, you're going to be able to go to come to come to come to come to come up with app
The next question that will be clearly, "Who are all photos retuse all photos?
And yeah, so it's pretty much every photos, but that's just a small part of the second.
This is the first photo that I didn't do that, and that was also the first time I was a biciniode. I had a biciniode.
I know that's going to be pretty personally, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me at the day, this is what I'm on the day.
My friends had to stay with me.
This is me on a pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama.
This is me with the football team and in the V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you're not seeing images of me.
It's constructs, and it's constructs of profession, from Hairstylists and Make-up artists and photographs and stylists and stylists and stylists and the advance.
Okay, as next, when people ask me, people are always wondering things like, "We're going to do?"
Yeah, I have too many 20-cm-cm-cm-cmaking, but the things I've never met, but the things I'm great things I'm bit of things I'm going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went to a laden, and I went to a laden, and you had my money. And you gave me the clothes.
And as a teenager, I was in my friend, a terror, and they were able to turn a red, and of course, and of course, and of course, and it taken a brought, "I needed," and we could still get on.
I've got this cost of my cost things because of my personality, and not because of my personality and there are people who are personality and not because of their personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were filter in the last year, and they were 85 percent black and latino and latino and latino and latino and mostly young men.
It's live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men't asking the question and latino, "Who I say, "Who I said, "Who do I stopped?"
It's like, "How often do I'm going to turn? When I'm going to stop?"
And in my rights, I found that I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers are not going to be 178 percent when they're 178 percent.
The last question is, "How is it, how is it to be a model to be a model to be a model?
And I think they expect them, they expect this answer, "If you're a little bit of thinner and longer hard, you feel very happy and felt very happy and fabulous and fabulously happy."
And Backstage, we give answer that might be a responsible.
We say, "It's really great to reach so much to work with creative, and it's greative, inspired, inspired people."
Everything that's true, but it's just the half of the story, because what we never said before the camera, what I've never said, "I feel like, "I feel better."
And I feel like I'm sure because I have to think about my exception.
And if you ever ask yourself, "What am I happy if I was happy when I had thinner and longer possible hair?
And then you should meet a few models because they have the thin, because they've got the thin, and the most coolest powerful coolest clamothes, and they're the most of their exception, and they're probably used to the planet.
When I wasn't prepared to me, it's very difficult to tell me, a real picture, because one of the picture, because one of the fact that I was very uncomfortable to tell me, and I got all the benefits.
It was very difficult to be a very difficult, a repression of universal sex and race of opening a biggest use of the largest use of it.
But I'm happy and feel happy, and I'm going to be here, and I think it's great that I've been able to tell you that I've been able to tell you about 10 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 30 years, because I wouldn't tell me how told me how I't me
If you take a talk to this talk to this talk to you, we're all hopefully in our power of imagination and failure.
Thank you.
I've never forget the words of my grandmother, which is in the exility of my gaddafired, "Son, afford.
But who never will never be like a gaddafi-Revolutionary revolutionary."
Now, it's almost two years, since the libysche revolution is inspired by the waves of the waves of the waves of the massive revolution in the Egyptian revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, with many other libyers, and outside Libyens to corns to start a day of the Zorns and to start a revolution to start a revolution to start a revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Boysche, libysche and men and men, in the first series, the end of the regimes, hold slogans of the freedom, and social justice, and social justice.
They've been able to provide mother by using the brutal dictature of brutal dictature Gaddafis.
They've shown sense of solidarity, from the farm, from the far, until the farmers, until the south.
Finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 deadly 50,000 deadly, and we're going to stop our country and tyrants.
But Gaddafi, but a big citizens, a great corruption, the tyrannei, the basis of the corruption and the basis.
Over four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannian regime, and the infrastructure, and the moral structure of the lybic society.
The consciousness and the challenge of challenges, I burned out how many other women, I women to build the civil society, and we're going to record a civilization and never been regarded by democracy and neveral equality.
And so, in 200 organizations were during and unmedened after the case Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exil, I came back to Lybia, and with a unique, and I started to the same thing, I started to the subjection, human development and leadership, human development and leaderships.
With a wonderful group of women, I started to go to the peace, I women, and I women, a movement of women, leaderships, and it's approaching public transportation of the women's public strength of women's.
And in the previous pollinators, I met a very difficult environment, a polarized polarized. One polarized by the egoistic politics of dominance and exclusion.
I was a slide of the peace of peace, and I'm going to be achieve women to collect available choice, and no citizens, no matter, no matter, no matter, and to pick up the right, and citizens.
And at the end of our initiative and successful.
Women women women's 17,5 percent of the National choice in the first choice for 52 years.
But long, but the euphories, the euphories and the whole revolution, and the whole revolution, we'd growing up to news of violence.
A morning, we grow up to the money to the money, and Sufi-Grebern.
In another morning, we got news about the morning about the message of American message, and the attack on the message.
And then, again, the morning of officiences of officiences.
And really, really, we're going to grow up under the miliples and their other military understanding the people rights and their power and their power and their power and laws and laws.
Our society, our society, in a revolutionary, polarized, polarized by the ideal and principles and principles, social justice, social justice, social justice she had started in the beginning.
Intolerance, exclusion and roachs were revolution, the Iconents of the revolution.
I'm not there today to inspire you with the success story of our remarkable story and the choice and the choice.
And I'm a lot of time today, we're like a nation that we've been miserable choice and the wrong choices.
We've been set up our priorities.
Because the choice needs to be stability or security or security in Lybia.
Hat the retirement of the rest of the wech and the way between female and men's brought and national powerful consumption?
No, she didn't.
What is it that?
Why is our society is polarized by ourselves and dominated by self-dominance politics of dominance, and the exclusion of men and women?
Maybe the women didn't have the only thing that has been missed, but the female values of the compassion, the gnade and the inside of the including.
Our society needs a national dialog and consensumering the educational education, and the choice, the polarization and decade, and the distance.
Our society needs the qualitative required the female of the female of the female of the female of the female.
We need to stop in the name of the zorns and a day of the roach and a day of the roach.
We need to start in the name of the compassion and the gnade and the gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that wouldn't just going to follow the female, but also too, but also instead of the gnade, instead of working, instead of collaboration, instead of stattle, instead of stattle.
These are the ideals that are a completely crime, which is a range of war.
Because the peace has a alchemy, and in this alchemy, it's about the feminal view of the femines and masculines.
This is the real remarkable remarkable.
And we need to do existence, before we do it before we do it before we do it.
After a transportation of the Coran "Salam" -- "The word "the-down God, raw God, raw.
The word "mheemic turns out in all the time," and everybody's known as the same Arabic terms like the word "rahem" and symbolized the word "mbolized the whole feminal feminal feminal feminal humanity, and that's the whole of the whole mank
And just like the motherleibrating the embryo, which is growing in him, so next to the currently the whole existence of the current existence.
And so, so, we said, "My gnade, everything is all things."
So we said, "My gives us, my gnade has been prediction.
Well, there are all the grains of the gnade.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought, my country, and I grew up with the song with the song, and I grew up.
And I was very proud of it.
In school, we were looking at the story of Kim Il-shape, but we don't learned to be out there, except that America, South Korea, South Korea and Japan our enemy.
And even though I was often asked me, I thought, I thought I was going to spend my whole life in North Korea to a whole life to a change.
And with seven years, I saw a public he was a public he thought, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to suffering.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter of the Swester a colleague.
And you know, "If you're going to be here, our families are not going to be five families, because we've been eaten in the world, because we've been eaten.
We're going together on the ground and our body are so tough, we're soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time, I heard that people in my country.
And I went to the terms of the terrible and I saw something that I didn't looking at my memory.
One living woman lay on the ground, and a hold child in their arm, and a sky in their arm,
But nobody helped them because all of them were so carefully to care about itself and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hungernot in North Korea.
And at the end, more than a million North Koreaner's hunger, and many otherwise, and many otherwise, and many otherwise, because they were bugs and tree, and tree.
In the homeworks were always been highly holding me up to me, except for me to the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the
I always asked me why they had lights, and we didn't have.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbora and his neighborhood.
This is the river, the river, which is the border of the border of North Korea and China and China and China.
As you can see, the river, the riversity of the river, and it's the river, and the river.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw lights in the river.
I can't say a lot about how I finally remembera, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I was sent to China, I was sent to China.
I thought I was just sure that I was a short time of my family.
I never thought that it needs 14 years to live 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very hard to live without family.
I had no idea of how life would be like the life as north Korean flying. But I was going to be involved. But I realized that it's not just extremely dangerous, but also very dangerous.
So I lived in stronger that my real identity could be fly identity, and you would be in a terrible sending in a terrible shocks.
One day, my greater alptraum was true when I was dreamed by the Chinese police, and in the police, and in the police.
Somebody was to be north Korean, so they tested my chinese, so they tested my chinese and asked me to tell me about my challenge.
I had this fear, I thought I thought I was exploding.
Would be sort of unnatural, I could be innoved innovation, I could be used.
And I thought that would be the end of my life, but I was able to control my feelings and responsible to answer the questions.
And after they were finished with the experience said, "That was a false of the other: "This was a wrong.
It's not North Korean.
And they were going to go. It was a wonder.
Some North Korean message in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had girls.
And even though they were expanded, they were free, they were free, they were able to released international pressure.
These north Koreaner, not so much lucky.
Every year, every year, in China, in China, and after North Korea, where they followed to North Korea, invited or public,
Although I had lucky, I had a lot of other northern Coreans don't know.
It's tragic that North Koreans are missing their identity and hard to survival.
And then, after they've found a new language and work in a moment on the head, their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the hidden of the hidden of the hidden, and so I started to go back to South Korea.
Mich in South Korea never returned out, was a bigger challenge, when I thought it was thought.
English was so important that I had to start learning my third language, my third language.
And I've been doing the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all the Korean, but inside the inside, we've been very expanding, we've been able to part of 67 years.
Islowed by an identity.
Bin me, I'm South Korean?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that my home, which my home.
Although, even though, I didn't southern Corean life, I had a plan.
I was already for the task for the university.
And I was set up in my new life, I was high schocking a shock.
The North Korean tests, the money I started to sent my family, and as a punishment, and as a punishment, and as a punishment, and when you're going to put a country.
They had to fast as possible as possible, so I started planes.
North Koreans need to be an incredible strips on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to overcome the border and South Korea, Ironically to China, I was a plane to China and to China and to the north Korean borders.
Because my family, I had to talk about 2,000 miles, I had to suffering it, and then I had to Southeastasia.
The business is a week, and we've been created more and more massive.
Once, when the bus, when the bus, a Chinese police came in.
He took the exactly the exactly and started asking questions.
And I didn't understood a Chinese family, I thought they'd being a chinese.
When the Chinese practice, my family, I decided to tell him that she would be dream, and I was taking her attention, and I was.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, he was happy.
We did it to laotic borders, but I had to start almost all my money to border to border the border of Laos.
But even after we had the borders, my family, my family in the family, because of illegal border.
After I was paid money and shortly paid, my family, my family inside a month, but I was repeated in the capital, my family.
This was one of the biggest returns out of my life.
I had done everything to family to family to freedom, and we were so close to the family, but my family, just my family.
I went up and I went to the instruction and the police and the police, and I tried to family, and I didn't have enough money, but I didn't have enough money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man, "What's going to go?"
I was completely surprised that a piece of stranger.
In broken English and with a words, and with a words, and without a bank without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two other northern North Koreans, and two other northern Coreans,
And I thanked him from all the heart and asked, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he said, "I'm going to be.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The reviewed foreign foreign collection, and he'd need to take a new hope that the North Korean, and he showed me the friends and he showed me the friendly of foreign and the support of foreign, and the hope of the northern community as the northernational community as
Finally, after our long journey, my family, and I was returned to south Korea, but the freedom.
Many North Koreaner, they're going to get them in a new country, and as soon as they go to a new country, they're not going to start with little bit or even not a money.
The international community can help us in the education, the English limitation and many more.
We can also be the bridge of his bridge, and the outside of us in North Korea, because many of us in contact with families, and we send them information and we're going to help them information and money, North Korea, North Korea.
I had a happiness, so much help and inspiration inspiration in my life, I hope that I'm hopeful north Koreans, with international success.
I'm sure you're going to be a lot more successful North Korean, in the world, in the world, in the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I've just a bit of a bit.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now, I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very well.
He can't talk about, but he's communicating for a way that it couldn't be a way that it couldn't be a way.
Remi white, what love is.
He shared it condition, and he shared it involved.
It's not gone. He's not on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and imagine, and imagine that he never tells you never tell a lyer.
When he songs from our childhood, when he's trying to remember that I don't even remember one thing: how little we know about the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's a great. He's very good.
He's a absolutely uncomfortable memory.
But he's also a selective.
He can't remember if he was remembered my chocolate, but he remembers, but he reminds of the public songs that we had conversation, as he was in my iPod, as four, as four, as four, as the most public slide of the television of the television of
Do they don't hear incredible?
But many people are not true.
And in fact, because you don't understood in society of normal version of normal version often understood and wrong.
But what my heart, my heart, and my soul, and my soul, even though this was the case, even though they were not as a case, even though they were just a case that it was just autism, it was autistic and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so trusted with the terms of you, it's autism, it's a complex faction of the brain, which is social communication, and sometimes the social skills and sometimes the learning.
It's extremely different from every individual, it's Remi, it's like Sam.
And global world is going to be in a new person autism, and even though there's one of the most fastest growings, and even though there's one of the world, there's no known as a known as a cause or hold or hold or hold or holding.
And I can't remember the first time I'm autism, but I can't remember, but I can't remember it.
I was born three years old, when my brother, and I was born, and I was even a new west in my life.
And after a few months, he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and actually, and actually, it's not very interested in me.
Remi, and he lived in his own world, with his own world, and he founded with his own rules, and he found things like this little thing in the smallest things that are in a set of the space of the space, and everything machine, and everything that's what it was.
And when he was older, he was different, he was different and the differences were invisible.
But behind the wutances and the frustrator and the frustrial hyperactivity was something really unique, a reine and unique, a boy, a boy, a boy, a human, a human, a human, a human, a human, a human,
And also, extraordinary.
Now, I can't teach that there were some exactly some moments in my family, I gave me, moments that I wish I was wished that they were exactly as I was like I was.
But I'm going to learn the ideas that they've taught me to the things that they've been talking about individuality, and I understand that these things I don't understand that these things I wouldn't want to thousands of normality.
Normality, the beauty that's beauty, and the fact that we're not different, and the fact that we're not that one of us, that one of us are wrong.
It's just means that there's another way of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi, and to share and to you, and then it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You're extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a gift, and we have a gift, and in all of us, and in all the early, and in all the early, the ultimative opencial.
The chance of size, progress and chance and chance in the moment where we're trying to be different.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has filled us with earlier and curiosity with this photo on the photo on the photo on the photo on a million-time million-time million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and see the world, and we see the world, but a billion pictures per second.
I'm going to show you a new way of photography that femto-Fotography, a new picture of technology that they can make time, that they can make time to make time light in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build cameras, and we can look at each other, or without a <unk>-ray picture in our body, and really in our body, and really in our body, and really in our body.
Now, if I take a laser pointer, and I'm going to take a billion seconds -- that's more femtoseconds -- that's a package, I'm a package, and this photon, and this photon, and this photon, and this photon-paketer, and this photon-petrometridge
So if you take this projectil, this photon, this photon, and it's going to take it into these flaps, how are these photones in the flasks in the flask?
What does light in timelupe?
So this whole eventually eventually.
So, think about it, you think that's actually less than a nanosecond, it takes less than a nanoseconds -- so light to return to the light, but I'm light, but I'm light to see the factor of the factor of the factor of the light.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financial exploration.
So, in this movie, so much, so you can analyze what happens to show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, our project, we're going to start a photonpaket, and that's starting to move around and the breaks into the breaks.
And part of the lights outside the table, and you see these exhibition and you see these excuse.
Many of the photones of photones, the last last, and exploding the rivers of the flowers and exploding directions.
As you can see, there's air, which is air, which is in the flower.
And as a result, the waves are crossss on the table, and because of the reflexions of the top of the reflexions of the rivers on the end of the flashing.
Now, if you take a projectilure project, and it's the same streets and the video back to the factor 10 billion, you know, you know how long you have to see how long you have to see how long you have to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long-term -- from a slow -- from a slow-long projectil in movement.
And what about something still looks like a still piece of picture?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like when you're in a piece of a piece.
I was like this, it's like this, the nature would be a photo, the photo, but of course, but of course, of course, our eye, of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the light, you're going to remain this light, that's not going to stay. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and the light, and the light in their lights, and after some of the seconds.
So in the future when these femto-Camera in your camera in your camera in your camera, it could be able to make it possible that you can go to a supermarket, and they're going to touch it, without touching them.
So how did my team at MIT this camera?
So, as a photograph, if you're a photograph of religious light, you have very little light, but we're very little lighter than your cutting males, so faster than your courts, so good as well.
So we're doing this is, we send this projectil, this photon, this photones, and we're going to show you the synchronization, and we're going to combine these gigabytes of data, we've been able to show you.
And we can take all these rhdates and doing this, and so interesting things.
So, superman can fly fly.
Other sky can make us feel like this, but how would it be a new superherocraft for a future for a future souperheroes:
The idea is that we're going to tell you something light on the door.
It's going to go back into the space, a part of it, part of it will reflect the door, and finally, and finally, and we could use these more simplicated, and we could use these more simplications of the light.
And that's not a science fiction. We even built it.
Links, you see our femto-Camera.
Hind the wall is a puppet, and we're going to let the light on the door.
After our drawings in the Nature communication, and it was published by nature, it was being released by nature.communication.communication.
We're going to take this light projects, and they're going to get to these walls and then they're going to be able to get in all directions, and some of the photones are going to be able to reach the light, and then we're going to reach the light, and then the dry.
And because we have a camera that's so fast is -- our femto-Camera has some single camera.
She's a very good time, and she can look at the world in light.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what we don't know what we're heard.
If we can take a laser on the screen, we can take a roh-picture that -- how they're looking at the screen, but if we look at the screen, but if we're going to try together, and they try together, and they try together, and they try together, and try together, and they's.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a bit of doing this, we can use the lab, we can use the practice, we can use collisions, and we can use collisions, and we can see what's going to look at the curve, or we can look for survive.
But because of the blood and tissue is, of course, it's very, very, very importantly, so that's why this is a way to think about female photography, because a new picture of medical processes, because a new probably the next generation of medical medical medical medical process.
So, as in Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, and we can't have a scientist, and we're going to be a art, and we've been clearly clear that all of these gigabytes of data that we're not only know that we're not just the scientific education that we don't know about the scientif
But it's happening here too.
If you look at these waves under the rivers, you can see that the waves of us, you can see that the waves of us.
The waves should be moving to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we've been in light, because we've almost in light, we've seen this image, and one of the image incredibly incredibly incredibly.
The rest of the events in the events in the world, in the world, in the world, in the camera in the camera, so by relationships, so we can use the relationship, we can correct this distress and time.
So, no matter whether we should be able to create education, or the creating creating medicine or new demands, and we've been able to reinvent the data and datails, and we've details.
It's about time. Thank you. Thank you.
There are many ways of our opportunities, how our middle of our lives.
We don't meet every neighbors on the street, so many ways, so many ways, but we're going to use the same public place.
In the last few years, I tried to share with my neighbors and share things like tasks and crosss, slaps and crossss.
The projects were made out of my questions, how much members of my neighbors?
How can we teach more things without us to stop us to stop us?
How can we share our memories to share our memory buildings and the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for a list homes, so that our communities, so that our conditions and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My soul, my souls are big embracted by hundreds of years, hundreds of years, beds and trees and dreams, and I'm going to be a city where there's always music.
I think every time, every time, every time, there's no one parade, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings, but it's also the city, but it's also the city of the world, most reason in America.
I'm going to be able to survive this house, and I thought it's beautiful. And I thought I thought that my life for always changed my life.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
You were Joan and she was Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, and unexpected.
I thought about death, and I thought, and I felt a big thankfulness for my life, and it brought me to me, and it's important.
But it's hard to me, this is hard to turn this point.
It's easy to lose in the Alltages, and to forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, and new friends of the line of the line, and I wrote a huge tafel and wrote the luck, "Bevor, I'd like to die." Everybody, I want to be a piece, I can take a piece of piece, I't commics a
I wasn't sure what I could expect to expect, but I was able to get the next day, the wall, and they were always walls and they're always wall.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the walls that were written by the wall.
"Be before I'd like to be piratrics, I want to be piratrician."
"Bevor I'd like to die, I want to stand up the International datums."
"Be before I'd like to die for millions of people sing."
"Be before I'd like to die, I want to plant a tree."
"Be before I'd like to live, I want to live "netics."
"Be before I'd like to die, I want to keeeep it once."
"Be before I'd like to be a cavallery."
"Be before I'd like to be myself, I want to be myself."
This is after that, this is a sense place, and the hopeful place, and the hope of human beings and dreams, and the wine, and wearing me as the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and to understand and in a new way of a new way.
It's about creating place for me, and to remember and remember what's important and remember what we're grow up and change us.
I've done this last year, and I've made hundreds of people who were going to build a colleagues that were building with their community, and I built my colleagues, and now I've been built in countries, South Africa, South Africa, South Africa, S
We've shown how much power our power public places, if we have the opportunity to share our voices.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever looking at things with the right view of the right view and think that life is that life is after all, and emotion.
We're often being able to talk about death to the death to think about death, but I realized that the preparation, but I've been involved in the death is one of the things that are strength.
The thought about death in the death,
Our common samples of places that are best, which is important. And as individuals and as a communities, and with more possibilities, and stories, and stories, and they can't help us to help us better places, they can help us better places.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm approached me with a particular mathematics. It's a special problem for everyone who's concerned mathematics are, is that we're like companies.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to explain the trial to explain what I'm going to explain what I do.
And then one of the human activities.
We're returned to be able to see the ballett and soups and soups and same same.
And then, in the balletting, extraordinary big scale and abilities and abilities, and possible eventually a genetic consumer that could have a genetic context.
Traurs, testroy neurological disorders like Parkinson slowly, this extraordinary capacity. That's what I was doing in my time, who was a ballettual skill.
And over the years, you have a lot of progress in the treatment.
But yet, there's a worldwide 6.3 million people who are living in this disease, and they need to be incredible symptoms like symptoms, tremor, symor, and more living.
We need to measure the projective message, and we can measure, and finally, really, really, really, if we have a cure that there are a objective measure that these question.
<unk>rouncilially, there's no biomarkins, and other movements, so you can't just do any biomarker. The best thing that there's this 20-minutes.
You have to do it in clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very expensive, extremely expensive studies, and never done never.
But what if patients could do this test to do this test?
That would be a tour in the hospital tour in hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't be a teureshouse personal hospersonal.
It costs 300 percent, 300 percent, in neurological action in neurological relationship.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods that we're trying to reach that we're all trying to get to achieve, because we're all senses like my recognition.
Here you see a video of video of video.
This is what happens in healthy, if someone speech. We can look at our speaker. We can look at ourselves as a stimmorganization because we have to coordinate all these voice, and we all have to coordinate the genes, and we all have the genes.
And as Ballet, it's enormously enormous.
Think about how long a long time to talk about how long a child.
And by the loud, we can certain the position of vibrate voices, and as the marriage of parkinson, and as the voice of parkinson.
On the bottom of the bottom of instance, you can see an example of voice movements.
We're always seeing the symptoms.
If you're awaker, sister, sweat.
The language is actually afford to the time, and that's an example, and that's an example,
And this impacts on the voice, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, but with digital microphones and presence, and presence of microphone, combined with new line, and now we can now be very exactly involved with news, we can now be very exactly.
How can you measure these tests with clinical message? Well, they're both invasive. The test.
But also, it's a little bit. The infrastructure is there.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. There's not going to be true.
So you can be done by self-down.
They're very quickly, three times 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something extremely brilliant, you can use it in big scale.
And this amazing goals with this.
We can reduce logistic systems for patients.
Patients don't have to leaders in clinics in clinics.
We can see if we can relate through highly objective data.
We can do a counter-cruting massive studies and first studies, and we're going to be a supply the whole population of the whole population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for biomarkers for the disease before it's before it's before it's before it's before it's before it's time before it's time before it's time before it's time.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we started the parkinson's sative.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to voices to voices, to provide enough to the rich of these goals.
We have Ruffering, the dreiving a billion people on this planet,
Everybody, or without parkinson, you can't get to get a few center to get a few center. I give you a few center. I give you achieve for six percent of our goal.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people, you can say 10,000 people say, who's healthy, and who's not?
What are you going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients are going to be patients, whether these person on parkinson't suffering.
Some people are not going to be able to create it.
But we collect a huge database, under a huge database, which is interesting. These environment, because we are important because we are important because we're really important to parkins, which are actually the real marker for parkinson.
Time, you know, you know, 86 percent gene?
It's much better.
My students, I have to love him -- I have to love it because he's so fantastic work -- has shown that it's also working on the mobile phone works, and we're going to work on what this project, and we're in 99 percent.
I call this a connection.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the cell phone calls and the test. Parkinson, and people with parkinson, so that their voice, so that their doctor of the hospital.
That's exactly what I think.
Thank you. Max Life, my dad, my dads and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenya, I live in Kenyairobi national parks.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the cows is the nairobi national park.
The Nairobi national park is in the southern Counters. It means that wildlife. That means that wildlife, like Zebras the park.
The radio, the solutions, the solutions, and then they do this.
They kill killed our field.
This is one of our cows that was killed. I was killed. I was great. It was dead. It was awful. It was our only buildings.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we believe that we were collapse with our animals and the way together.
I learned to hate solutions.
Our warrior, our heaters. They're protect our stamm and our hearts. They're also brought to our heart.
and kill the solution.
Here's one of six solutions that were killed in Nairobians.
And I think there's a national park, there's a few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few
In my stem is a boy between six and nine years, and nine years, and nine years, and it was also the cows.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fewers. Lions. Lions for me.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to see the solutions, but the cows that are better.
But I didn't go on. I didn't do it.
I had a second idea. I tried to a bird.
I wanted to think that the solution, I thought I was standing up the cow.
But solutions are very smart animals.
You're going to see the birds, and they go back. Because next time, but they're going to move, and they're still not, that's still there.
And they're going to kill our fields.
One night, I thought, I wake up with a packel in the hand around the hand to get him, and that's not great.
So forwards for light that moves.
I had an idea.
And I was a little boy, I worked on my room, and I took the whole day in my room and took the new radio of my mother. And I had learned me. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took an old car, and I'm going to show a direction of a motorcycle. The right or left. He's right or left. He's blink.
And I was a switch of a switch to switch the lights.
This is a little bit of a caps from a captained tape.
And then I built everything.
The solar panels the battery, the battery, the battery, the battery. I call it a transformator.
And the direction of the right.
You see that the bulbs are going to show you, because of the solutions,
And this is what it looks like this, if they come to the solution.
The lights are blinking and the solution, and the solution, and I was about the stall.
Thank you.
I've been doing this installed, and we had no problems, we didn't have a problems.
And then our neighborhood.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of their animals, and she asked me if I could ask me if I could install them.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed. They can see the lights. They can see the solution.
Since then, I've been in the neighborhood in the neighborhood, and they work really good.
My idea is now used to be used in all the country, even for other predators like hyen or leopards or leopards, elephants, elephants.
My invention, I'm going to be a stip of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school, my new school, and helps and helps and helps and help.
I even brought my friends with my friends and common installing the lights where there's no lights, and I'm going to show them.
A year ago, I just a boy from the Savanne, who was a boy. I saw airplane, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a sitting in a sitting in a sitting!"
And here I'm going to stand up here.
I was involved with a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a big, I want to be airplane. That's my great dream.
I've got a solution. But I can go through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the solution, and we can live without side, side, side, without strong without strangers without strangers.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language means that, I'm really thank you.
You know, you know, you know, how to hear a story like your story like your story like your story like your story.
So you've got this stipel. Yes. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
Now, my next invention, now I work on a electrical caune. One electrical caune?
Yeah, I know, electrical cities are already invented, but I want to required my own.
You've already trying to give you, I'm trying to give you away, but I've been trying to give it, because I got ...
All of the beginning is hard Turere, you're a very special best.
We're going to be in every step in a way to help you, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm since old enough to hold a camera in the hand, photography, but today, I'd like to share with you today, and I'm going to share with you, and no one of them.
There was no kind of director, no style, no chance, no chance, no chance, and not even the picture.
In fact, mostly, mostly, mostly, mostly, mostly,
My story begins when I was in New York, and my wife, and my wife, and my daughters on my daughters on my arm, and we were on my arm. We were on the corner of 57thers and 57thers.
And so we were going to be able to go back into New York and so we decided to shoot the same picture.
Well, you can see what you can see.
When the third birthday, my daughter said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina didn't make a father-down, and it's a father-down, to lead the ritual for the ritual for the ritual for the ritual?"
And then we started to make a picture of tourists, a picture of us, a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, as universal as universal totally fully free of their camera.
Nobody's never said, no one has never been lucky, and fortunately,
And then we didn't know how much these rice, how much these rice.
This journey is very holy.
This one was just after the 11. September 11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, and I had to understand what happened in the day.
These images are much more than just one, or a moment, or a certain moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way to reflectober that week in the october, and how we change our time, and how we change our time, not just physical, not just physical but in all,
Because even though we're doing the same perspective of Mal. While they're always reaching new miles. While they're always seeing the life with their eyes, and how they see it with all about how they see it.
These are very intensive time that we're going to spend apartment that we're expecting every year.
Last, as one of our rice, as one of our rice, and we started to suddenly, and suddenly, and she's suddenly drawing in a puppet of a puppet of a puppets, they love to love to love to love to love to love to love to love to love to love to love to lo
And she told me about her feelings that she had five-year-olds that she had five-year-old.
She said that she remembers like her heart from the heart of the breast, when she saw the late of the late of the first time.
And now she looks like in New York, because she's in New York, because she's in New York.
And I was created, the most important thing we're all created, are memories.
And so I want to share with you with you the idea of aware of memory in the most conscious memories of memories.
I don't know how it looks like this one, but I'm going to look at this 15 pictures, I'm on a families.
I'm always doing this picture.
I want to get every one of you today, and I want to get to the image, and do not want to ask you, "Would you do not ask a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
