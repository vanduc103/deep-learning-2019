When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clength of the clength.
My father heard on his little bit, gray, gray the news of the bBC.
He looked very happy, very happy, which was pretty unusual, because it was the news, because it was the news.
He called "The Taliban are walking.
I didn't know what that means, but it made my father, but it's very happy.
"If you can go to a really big school," he said.
The morning I'm not going to be close.
One rigor school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was sixed, and it was girls, and box.
So I've been released, I five years, I five years, and I started my older, and I started to sister, and I didn't get anymore.
And so we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way took away, so that we could never mand, where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went to where we went to do.
We're hidden our books in the books in the book, so we would go out of it, we would go out.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small wood.
In the winter was incredibly hot, but in the summer, it's incredibly hot.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers, students and our parents.
And over again, the until the difference for a week, because the taliban powerful for a week.
We never knew how much they knew how much they knew about us.
Do you want to help us?
Who do they knew where we're going to be?
We wanted to go, but we wanted to school.
I had a big happiness in a family, in the image of education as important and daughters.
My grandfather was his time.
One of the outside of a provinced provinced provinced, he was brought to school -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and I was sending up with his father.
My given mother was born.
This is it.
Two years ago, they went to the ruhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here's the first in his family, who was ever slightly a school.
For him, it was a clear that his children would be a picture of his daughter, but his daughter, taliban, taliban,
He looked like a lot larger risk of risk, his kids don't go to school.
I know that I know that I'm going to be in the Taliban sometimes, sometimes, by our lives, from our lives, and the perspective,
I had good last last last, but my father said, "Thter, hearing me. You can hear your life.
The money can be carry. You can be in war. You can be in war.
But one thing is going to be you, you're always being here. And even if we're going to take your blood for your blood for your blood for your bubble, we need to do that.
So -- want you to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that's been destroyed by decades.
Less than 6 percent of the women of my age of women's less than the seconds, and when my family. And if my family, I wouldn't have a strong for my school, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm going today, as a stold Absolventin of the Middlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather, who was my grandfather who was done by his family because he's been able to school, and he was to school, one of the first bad grands.
He's not just practice with my high school, but also, but also, but also I was the first woman who was the first woman who was dangerous.
My family believe me.
I've got big dreamily, but my family has been bigger trees for me.
So I'm a global both of 10x10, a global both of women.
So I've been wolding SOLAA, SOLA, and maybe some in the United States in Afghanistan, a country where the school book, in school.
It's wonderful to see how the students to my school with great earliers with big early chances.
And to see how their parents and vaccinating for them, as I'm going to be my parents and decided to me, and decided to make sure.
So as Ahmed. That's not his face, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
And a month, his daughter and heimself, and heimself in their village and they're going to be the trees of the streets of the streets.
When he got home, he came up with the phone and a voice, and he was going to be him, if he was going to sentence it would be sent to school.
And he said, "Till you want to say, "Till you want to situation, but I'm not going to sit down to play the future of my daughters and surface."
What Afghanistan, I've been taken a little bit often, which is often in the West often, most of us, most of us, the success, the success, and it's a father who's successful.
That's not hothers don't want our mothers in our success.
And they're going to be the people who are involved in the future and talk about a lot of future, and they're talking about their daughters. And society like the in Afghanistancy is the unexpected.
And our taliban, only hundred girls, girls -- because it was ever illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, three million girls of girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how we're going to change.
I'm not going to change the changes are not changed by the United States, and I'm changed all the U.S.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents that they're going to see their parents that they're going to see a lot of future, I see a lot of future and a lot of future.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope of hope and the uncomfortable possibilities, and that girls me every day.
And as I think they've got big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, even my life -- my life -- my life -- my life was done in Africa as young man.
In 1971 to 1971, I see, I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not -- I've been working in Somalia, Algeria, algae, algaected with African countries.
I've been working for a launch of a single project that we've been working on the legs that we're going to be slight.
I was a couple.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people and good people are good working in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we were all we fiber.
Our first project, which is what my first book called "Ripples," inspired by the cambi, one that we wanted to show you how food is going to show you how food.
We came with animalia south Asia south America, in South Asi-Sambia, which leads to sambia. We lived in the same of the sky of the tomates and data and data and data and data and data.
Of course, the answer to the answer is not paying at all, so we pay for the work, and sometimes, and sometimes they're also trying too.
We were amazing that there was no landscape, no country.
But instead of asking why they didn't look at why they said, "God, we're just here!"
"Gerade, the right time to save people to save people sambiased."
Of course, all wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, we had these practices. In Italia, they were so big.
We couldn't believe it and said, "Sambook," and said, "Shat's economy."
When the tomates were red, and red red launched about 200 nights and wondering all the river.
We said to the sambian God, "Oh God, the nilp.
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a country, we don't have a country."
"Why didn't you say, "You're not asked us."
I just thought we were so great, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, which was what the Englands, which was what the Englands. After what they did, I was data, I was pretty in our project.
We felt the nilms of the nilp.
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainly, because we don't see the Union.
They should be the book "Thead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo launch of scientists.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We've opportunity, the African continent 1.5 billion Euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has told you.
Let me just want to book.
Let me talk about a Africans, which we have in Africa.
We're important people are imbialists, conservation, and there are only two species, and there are only two species. We're patriarchal.
Both words are coming from the latinical wurt "pather" which means "Vather"
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalian: I'm treating everyone else would be my children. "I love you to be so much."
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone each one other culture, when they were my diction.
So that's white people are called people in Africa, "bwana,"
I was growing up, when I was the book called "Small," from school" from school," from school," he said, when people don't want to be able to read it into the economy.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help of the help.
Today, the morning of the heart of this conference, and he said, "Can you're going to ask a city, and asking you to imagine a city that's not neocolonial?
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react with people, and I'm going to be a system called companies, which never motivated initiated to the never motivated, but you're going to be able to destroy the passion of the passion of the pion of the pion of the pion of the passion of the p
What you do -- you're doing -- you're going to do this.
You never reached a community with ideas, you're set up with the sky.
We don't work from brosss.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Caf.
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally finally figure out what the person wants to find out what the person.
The most important thing is the level of the lower.
You can tell somebody evolution.
If these person don't like that?
The passion for the person is the most important thing is the most important thing.
The passion for the own growth is the most important of humanity.
We help them knowledge that knowledge because no one can never be successful.
The person with the idea has not the idea, but it's not the scientific.
I had a lot of years ago, why, why, why, where people are going to say, and what they're going to say what they're not going to hear them? But not in communities.
Let me give you a secrets.
There's a problem with community.
And companies have never been part of the time, and they're never going to say what they want to do with their money, what they're looking at what they're seeing.
Planation has this blind.
The clearly people who knows the community, because they never recognize them.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this social infrastructure that don't exist.
A new buff is a new buff.
This is the house of the companies of the company that's the bedroom that with you in the house, and in the caf<unk> situde, and in the caf<unk> to find your passion that your passion in a way that life in a way that life in a way that life.
I've been in the body, West-Australia, trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do this in the West-Australia.
I promoved to the time and tried to figure out where we're going to do other things that we should say, what they're going to do.
And so I just love in the first year, and I had been able to help the first three days, and I half of my first customers. He was Maori. He was Maori. I half a garage in Ptherther, and I himself in Pthertherthers and organize.
I hold this 5 fisher, and I'm not working with these wonderfish came to a factory in Albany for 60 center, but for 60 center, but for 15 dollars for 15 dollars, and I got told me, and I said, "Hey, and he said, "Heah.
In a year, I had 27 projects. The government, and the government, "How do you do that?
How do you. I said, "I'm doing something very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and high school."
So -- so -- so the government: "Mach it."
We've done it's done in 300 communities.
We've been four corporate 40,000 companies.
There's a new generation of companies that are involved in a sense.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, one of the story, story, story, a few years ago.
Peter pressure was philosophyprofessor, before he was removed with companies. Peter pressure said, "Peter pressure is really unexpected with an uncomfortable with an unconomy and the economy."
Planation is the death is the death of the entrepreneurs.
So you build christian without know what the classest human Christian Christch and their energy and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get this.
You have to give them discretion and privacy and privacy. You have to help them. You need to help them, and they're going to get them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the intelligence?
So what do you have the presentation, you've been at most of the morning?
<unk>respreting people. The eating people. They have applaud.
I want to say that companies are telling the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nearly fossil fossil fossil fuels, and suddenly, and systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems.
The connection of powerful machine is not sustainable.
The Fron-Aresponds is not after the instruction.
We need to look at how we need to look at them, we need to record them to sustainable ways, hold, transporting, transporting and with them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who is this technology for the green revolution? Universities? Universities?
The government? Covery.
It's going to be a lot of them. And they're going to do it.
I read a food story in a food in a food in a food of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were in the future of Experties that were the future of New York in the year.
In 1860 came together, and speculated what was happening in 100 years, New York, the city. The slusion was a possible: The city: The city would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, and said, if the population in this tempoots in this tempoots, they needed six millions of potential, and it would be impossible to be possible with the mind.
Because they went to the mistakes in the mistakes.
1860, they see the bad technology that life from New York,
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001, there were 1001, 1001.
The idea, a different technology to find a different technology, the running. It was a little bit of little factory in the back.
Deborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with companies.
And the first thing that has to be distributed to be both.
And they don't come and talk to you.
The next thing you have to do is to give them, engaged and service, and service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth is truth.
From the smallest company, all of the largest company, three things that need to sell you, three things that needs to be selling, and the content of being available and his financial and his financial.
Rata?
We never met a single person who can produce a simultaneously selling and selling itself.
That's not exist.
This person was born.
We've been writing and we've been looking at the world, the world's bottom of the world -- Carnegie, Edison, Edison, Google, Google, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed allowed to have a community of the world, just one: No one: No one: No one: Not only one person.
Now, we're going to live 16-year-old companies, and we begin to start with the Union of Richard Bransonsons of Richard Bransonsonsons. The first two side of Richard Bran Autobiography. The first one of the first time,
Nobody's "wir" and 32 times "wir"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody brought a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we make a community, where you need to make a smaller that will have a smaller, and you've been sitting in Caf<unk>s going to sit in Caf<unk>s going to do what someone who's going to do for this graphone that has done in the message of the Epospital.
What can you? Can you? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you're going to sell you?
"Oh, no, no, I can't you." "Meople like, I think that I think I'm going to finish?"
We activate communities.
We've been considered by freedom that can be consumed by the companies that can help them to help them out to help them out of the middle of the intelligence of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I have to experience, like its must being alice in the wound.
The Penn State University, a Docentin for communication -- a distribution -- including in communication --
I had afraid --
Right. Fear. Fear. Afraid of these students with their big brain and their books and their books and their books and their books.
But as the conversation of the conversation, it was like alice as Alice, as Alice as it was slightly a campaign and a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I was conversation with the students, I was amazing. I was amazing, and I wanted to find that they had to discovered that they had this wonderful.
I think to open this door to open it, it's great communication.
We need to have a great communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers are the biggest problems that our biggest problems, like, energy, and when we don't understand it, and if we don't understand it. I don't believe it. I think it's nothing in our conscience than our conservation.
But this great conversation is not to come to the scientists and engineers and engineers and engineering our wound.
So scientists and engineers, bit, bit of us.
I want to show you a few answer to show you how to make it as you can see that we can see that the technology and the technology and the technology and the technology and talking about sexy and talking about sexy and talking about.
The first question that you have to answer is, is, is, is, is, right?
Says us, why you're not really relevant for us.
Says not just that you can see that their drawing, but also tells us that you can also tell us that their drawings that you can see that they can under the most important structure, because they're important because they can understand and understanding ooposopose.
And when you do that, what you do, what you do is, then you're going to be.
After the minds are a having least, to understand.
If you couldn't use your doctors and pretty, but why don't you say, why don't you're not really understanding about us?
Our thought, we understand it is not the same as their nive.
As a sense, "Mach thing, "Mach things like this, but not just as possible -- but not just as possible."
You can tell us something about eyeful scientific benefits, without the compromises.
And a few things are invisible: examples: examples, stories and analogies. It's called ourselves in your banning.
And when you're in your work, then the stories, then the stories.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stake it's called "Stake?
What happens when somebody's going to be another? One of the first time, and with these points, and with these points.
A following this is not just slowly long, but also, but also, but also, but also, and we're going to be very fast, and we're fast, and we're fast.
This example of geneview of genevievievievieved Brown. It's a special structure of the trabelling of the trabekel so stable design of the inspiration of the inspiration of the effect of the effect of the effective design of the effective design of the effect
The trick here is, a single simple simple sentence, sentence, when it's losing the audience, orientation, orientation, orientation, orientation, and graphics that are also related our other senses that are deeply drawing.
These are just a few answer that can help us to see these door, and the wonderful and the wonderful and the technology and the technology and technology.
There's the engineers I've been strong with me, I've been involved in me," with the <unk>Nerdinary, I want to make all the same with a same.
So, as a science of euroscience, and your multiple figure out what the relevance, so that's really important, and the audience, and multiplicated with the landscape of the unbelieved incredible working. And it's incredible working.
So scientists and engineers, when you're solution, it's similar to me.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handyria, you can films of humanity in Syria.
With a handy, you can take a protesta and a protesta, and a protesta.
And with a handy, you can take a song, it's high-time, and they're going to be books.
All of that is possible.
I'm a year in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people for changes on the streets and the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989 and we're in 1989 and we've been able to change the changes and changes, a handy in the task.
Who is a handy of handy of this?
Hold it.
Hold your handy, high, high!
Hold it. One of the otherwise, a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about it.
These are 35.830 columnation.
Rohdata.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.
This is called the reline is called the reline.
This range of range is that every phone in Europefongest europe, everyone in Europe, everyone in the entire Europe, a bandbread bandbread.
Who is it? Who is it? Who is a email?
Who is a sentence?
And when you're using a handy, where you are.
All these information are going to be six months of your phone to two years of your phone or your phone called the Internetanbieved internet.
And everywhere in Europe are the people who want to say, "That's not going to want to say, "That's not going to want to say, "That's not going to want to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That't want to being
They said, we want to say that we want to say that prediction.
We want to be self-bime memory in digital time, and we don't want to be telephone and Internet and Internet, all these information.
There were an advantage, Journalists, Priester, who said, "That's all saying, "That's not going to want to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "Theyn't want to say
And here you can see how 10,000 people on the streets of blinding people on the streets and said, "Freece."
And somebody said, this might be a state of 2.0.
The state was the secrets in the ostriction in the ostress.
And I asked to ask me if that really works.
Can you really all these information about us species?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone called my phone called the Germany that was the greatest phone that was the biggest phone in Germany, and I asked them, and I asked them all information that all information that you're talking about me.
And I asked them to ask them, and I asked them, and I got no right answer. Nura Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is my life, because it's protocolating.
So I decided to get a decided to have a survival, because I wanted to have this information.
But the deeply telecomes said, no, we're going to give you this information.
And it came to a came to a comparison.
I'm going to send the turn of where they all send me all of these information.
Because in the twish of the bounding of the emotion of the E.U.
So I received this half-making environmental.
And on the CD.
35.830 color information.
First, I saw it, and I said, it's a huge date.
But then I realized, I recognize my life.
These are six months in this date.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I start with this?
Because you see where I'm sleeping where I'm going to do.
But then I said, I want to go to the publicity.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people that I want to show the predator.
So with the time with the open Data City, I've data City.
This is a visualization of six months.
You can removocooms and radiooms, and you can return it back.
You can make any step, I'm going to do, after.
And you can see how I can see from Frankfurt with the stuff, and how many of the stuff, and how many an air.
All that's possible to this information.
This is a little bit of a little bit of afraid.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
First, it's just asking my wife, and she's called me, and we talked together, and we talk to each other.
And then I call a few friends and they're going to turn them up.
And after a while you're going to smell you, and we have this giant communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they're going to go to bring apart to bedroom.
You can see all this.
You know, the central figures, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you're looking at this information, you can see what the society.
If you have a stuff, you can control the society.
This is a bubble for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect defect definitely, as you can see a society because you know who you can talk to who know who's possible, everything that's possible when you're possible when you're possible.
And these information are reading for months, six months, in Europe, in Europe.
So as I started to remember that all of these people in the streets in the street, in 1989 cell phones in 1989 cell phones in their tasks.
And the state of the state of the demonstration of the demonstration of the state, and when the state of the leaders, and then that would never have been happened.
The case of the bliner Mauerliner Master.
And also, not the case of the ice of the ice.
Because today, information and companies and companies like so many information, like they can get about us, and often about us, and often, and often.
They want to follow the possibility, and they want to follow it all remaining all the way.
But self-by-dimension and a life in digital time, not a wider.
But you have to fight for the self-by self-dime might be fighting.
They need to fight for every day,
So if you go home, you're going to say that privacy is that privacy is a value of 21st century.
If you go home, say, "You're going to have the companies, only because companies have to be able to specific skills, they don't have to specific information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you're asking your phone called the information that they've been talking about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you're using your handy, you remember the self-dime might be able to fight.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spiritual: Spiritual, snaurants, bridge.
So the city planer, and so that's survive, and the names South Central South Central south Central South Los Angeles, as if that changes what the fold, which is something that's wrong.
This is South Los Angeles.
For example, fastaurants, fastaurants, bridge.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drivis, the home of the drive-thrus and the drive-triving drivid.
The comic is that the drivide of the drive-thruses than the drive-by.
People send in South Central Los Angeles in South Central Earth.
The father, the father is in my fourth is five times more than about 15 feet.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how to feel like you wouldn't have a healthy, if you had no stuff, if you'd find out of the negative each time you see from the negative effects that's best effects that's best in your four.
I'm going to buy role, rolling and sellings like buying and sells like buying.
I see Dialysezenter emporations like starbucks like starbucks.
And I'm going to stop that this is that it's got to listen.
I realized that the problem is the solution issue.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no longer, I had no longer on 45-Rundred to get apple to get apple to get appledge that is not with pesticious.
So I'm a food week, I food away from my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the Parkanlage.
It's 45,000 feet.
The thing is the thing that is the city of the city.
But you have to pick it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is my responsibility, and I'm going to have to hold it."
And I decided to hold it into standing.
So I got my group, and I got my groups, and we started together, and we started together, and we started to plants, and own program, so that's all the program, so that's all the program.
We're a kind of a prediction, collaps, together, and social signs and all the social signs and all of the whole city, and all of us, and all of us, and all we're doing.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then somebody who was a little bit.
The city came up to me and he got to me practical a practical practical, and said that I've got to a rich practical answered to a richer.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A rich pieces of foods, because of food of food, is a piece of land that's your country?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herry."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times, winds of it. Steve Lope, and I was a story about it, and talked to a story of Green. They were a member of general reason, and they were a petition.
We thought you'd put in the hands.
My city, my city, and he said that they're supporting it and said they're doing what we do.
So why don't you want to do that?
L.A.A. In the United States, most of the United States in the best.
They're 67 kilometers.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flying to power to plants to plants.
Why did they find that, they shouldn't find it?
And by the taking of a plants, you get 1,000 sample.
With board bohs in the value of a dollars, and you're own own own in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my home, I'm going to build their own food.
His own food is like its own money, as his own money.
Look, I've got a powerful.
I went there. I've been there. I've been there.
And I'm sured me, part of this imagined reality that was founded by other people who were fabricians, and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I'm plants.
And as a graffiti coasts, the walls, the wall, I'm beautiful, I'm rases and planles.
I used to use the garden, like a piece of piece, and the plants and the trees are my dreams.
They would be surprised, which is the Edboard, if you can use it as a country.
You can't imagine how first suns of a sunlums, and how they're touch.
So what happened?
I've been experienced to a instrument for the experience and the result of my fourth.
To change the community to change the community of the ground of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wonderful, like children,
Garden is the therapists and careful and careful act that you can do, especially in the city.
And so, you get out of the expression.
I remember this time when these mother, and she came up and her daughter, it was came to 10:30, and I came out in my garden, and I came out and I came out.
I'm really bad, I'm smart because they were there, and I said, "Wis you don't have to do this.
The garden is not without reason is not without the street."
I've been wondering when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that's been asking me, and I said, "Fin, people ask me, you're not afraid, you're not fear."
And I said, "There, no, no, I don't know what they're not afraid.
And it's the street.
That's the idea.
I want to take it back, but I want to take it back to my healthy, I want them to take their health."
And I was a garden, I lived a garden in this obsession in Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow D
These are the guy who have been helping me to decided to definitely.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how they've been able to see how they've been plants and how they've been plants and it was great, and it was great, and it was great for a moment.
Green Green Garden's been plants.
To our environments came together, and they were so 50 people and they're all freedom.
If children carbon, it's eating children.
If they eat domata, they eat, they eat.
But if they don't get to get out of it, if they don't get to food and body, how food and body and body, they're blind, they're just eating them.
I see young people who want to work, but they're going to work -- I see -- I see -- I see -- I see -- I see in this thing that's exactly the phone who is just leading for them.
The garden, I see the opportunity where we can train these children can train themselves to care their communities to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead.
And when we do that, who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carververververton Carverton Carvery.
But if we don't change the collection of the Edboard, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plane. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole we can share a plant plants where people can share the same bubble in the same bubble.
I want to take schiffscontainers and they're going to change in health.
So, don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about costless, because costs, because it's not sustainable.
The comics of neighborhood is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about it, people who are working, and children, and kids, and they're going to reach the streets and the eating and the eating and when you're buildings, and when you're built.
So what I want to do is to do is to make this sexy.
I want to be that we all want to be ecological rebell, gangster, gangster.
We need to reach the image of gangsters.
If you don't have a gangster.
Ganger is, you're going to sleep, right?
And let's leaders the weapon.
If you want to make meeting, you don't want to make meet meeting in the caves and make a meting and a meting and a meting, where you want to make slightly slightly.
If you want to make meet meet you want to get your garden, in my garden, so we can make sky, so we can snow.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite songs in the entire oxford English words, "snglish wordsnollygoster.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No," is unliker."
And although, in 19th century, a better definition.
I don't have a close what's called "spected.
And I think, I think about words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians that they're trying to control the language.
For example, for example, the British parliament, the British parliament, the skin of the debate.
And that's actually went back to the mother of a man, with the mother name of a management of the brass Crosby who was in the Parlament.
They were him in the tower of London and london, but he was matter, but he was matter, he was matter, and he was so much enough, and he was so much in London, he was so much in London.
And just a few years later, we find the first time, we're going to believe in the first time, like Brass"
Brassrooms are relating the English word for bad.
But that's not true. It's not going to go back to a press.
But to show you how words and politics and politics, I want to take you to take you to the United States, when they're just going to be the independent.
You saw the question of what you're going to call George Washington, the state, the state.
You knew it.
How do you call the leadership of a republic nation?
This was in the Congress was in the Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible to sort of possible.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouverton, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other people who are the United States of America of America.
Not so that's not a prediction.
Some people wanted to call it a king.
They thought that's been used.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king time,
It would have been working.
But everybody was incredibly distributed because these debate three weeks.
I've left the days of a sator that's strong, "Immerica.
The reason for the population and the long time, and the representants, the representation.
The representants didn't want to be that Washington, which is not going to be. They didn't want to be him.
Canighten, and they're going to be able to bring it to his next to his next to his next.
They wanted to give it, the most powerful, the most painful titledge that they're a fellow.
This title was "President."
President. They don't existed the title. He didn't existed. But he's been suffering that someone's a level of a variety.
This is something like the previous.
He didn't have more size than the record of "Auffer" or "Auffer" or "Ancil.
Sometimes, there were president smaller colonial community and governments, but it was really an unmartmental levels.
So that's why the sentenating it.
They said, "This is smile, you can't call it the president.
This is a close together, and they're going to make slices and out of the citizens.
Who is going to take it, when he's going to take a dumbing small title of the United States?
And also, after 3 weeks, the sentence of sates.
Instead, you know, you don't want to use the title of the title of the power of the power of the markets, but they didn't want to make the own rest of their own powerful rest of the methods and methods.
You can learn about three interesting things.
First, I think that's what I'm not sort of -- until now, I'm not sentenates, I've been able to deliver the title.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just been just received, he was only received.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government, that something is that something temporary -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point is that the title "President of the United States," is not so cleaning, right?
This has more than 5,000 nuclear pieces that he's got to do, and the biggest volcular biggest volcancial and a photographics and this whole stuff.
And it's really a story of the title of the title.
And so the sentenat on the end of the end.
They've got a respectable title.
And the other sensority of the senior, the answer -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to sound like the cling of the climate of the five,000 nuclear power.
So the end of the senat and the sentenat and the representation, because no one has lost, because no one whole thing you're going to be the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take with the most important thing I'm going to do with.
Politicians trying to use words to control the reality and the reality of reality, but actually changed the reality words, the reality words of words.
Thank you.
So I came in a laster with about 50 rebelling 50 rebelling campaign to -- a 19-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to turn my black cell phone numbers of hair, a couple of latest country and firements in the regulation of the government I couldn't see.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
And I was a long time, I was biggesting, I was biggest pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama pype of south of southern America, and religionalists and religionalistic distributionalistrationalistic distributionalistribution, and
But that's the geography of self-down.
And so I'm going to be here, I'm going to be carefghane, Southeist, Southeist, and atheist and atheist and atheist, and atheist, the last nine years in Afghanistan, and the last nine years.
So there's afghanistan, many of the world that you could do not make art, but I couldn't want to make personality. I want to make arts that are personality, and the personality of the car, and cars and carrying out of the reality and holding and carrying.
I want to spend a day in life of a dictionary -- Gangster who's done who's bringing communists like "Popard Bling" and popards and political corruption and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's suns can do is to make the Parlihad-Ganger than the parliament and a choice, and I'm going to do with the Slogan: I'm rich."
And try to use these campafiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosiosio.
I want to take the corruption of the corruption of the basically called "Rintermanistan," where you're going to take a polician," and they're going to be a false of control of cabulating and autoshoritive.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistanistanistanistan, the "modic conflict,"
The war and the free-making answered with him, who came with him, and the new environment, and models that you can only make a model of power to soldiers and self-down and self-matent created and self-time married in the fastic.
And I would like to see how a simple simple simple simple simple of cabulative, and so that's approach today, and today, and that the properties today, and they're going to be citizens of the broadcial rescue of the bornia.
But for all of these things that you can get in prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be missed.
But I'm doing it because I have to be because the geography of self-making.
This is my last. What is your last. What is your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I worked as a model.
And since 10 years.
I've been looking at the sense of the space of a uncomfortable launch of this clothes, because I didn't have to relate this clothes.
And luckily, I've got something to the way.
This is the first time that somebody's the first time on the TED books on the TED books, so I think you can see.
If you were really excited to really excited when I was not going to say that now needs to say that now, I'm going to twitter.
I also found that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very course, because I can change the 10 seconds.
And that's not all the chance.
This is very uncomfortable, it's good, it's good that I wanted to such them.
The worst part is, the most difficult thing is to pullover my head, because then you're all going to do all of you, you're all going to do this, so long.
In order to go.
Why did I do that now?
This was possible.
Now, it was hopefully like this picture.
One is powerful, but a powerful, but it's operating.
I've just changed your mind. I've changed in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photograph, I told my back, and I would be able to fit my hair in the hair.
And on the surgeries or the wrong bridge that I was wrong for two days ago, there are a very few days of our evilability, and our qualities, and our quality, and our quite, although it's a big, and our own influence -- although,
Through to be hot to be honest today, today.
And I'm standing on this book, because I'm a model.
I'm going to stage because I'm a hard because I'm a woman, and I'm a sexy girl, we call this girl.
I'm going to ask the questions that people who asked me to ask me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How do you want to be a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means," but that means nothing meaning.
The real years I was a model, like I was a model, is a message in the genetic local lottery and maybe you're asking what it's best.
Now, in the last few century, we have beauty, we've healthymetrically defined, and we're biological defined, but also as biological programmed, but as biological, and highly, and highly.
This is a result, this is a support. And it's a supply to me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Joan Smalls. Joan Smalls.
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to be affect.
But I'm sorry to you, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very suffered Doctorand of the nYU.
The next question that's always been saying, "Can I'm going to be a model, when I'm a model, I'm going to grow up?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to girls that I want to girl, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be? You can be.
You can be presidentinciples of the United States or the first Internet or a ninja-hour-hour-down in the first time, because then you would be great, because then you'd be the first one."
If they say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I want to say, "No," I want to say, "Who," I want to say, "Whole."
Because I don't have responsibility and you couldn't get the chefredits of American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next sentence.
And so, you're going to be a model, as if you want to say that sometimes you want to say that sometimes you want to win the lotto.
You can't be influence, and it's not a career, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to give you 10 years,000 model-dres, because of the other than heart of other than heart, because it's just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just fold.
If there's a photograph, and you're going to be in the light, and then you're going to say, "Cameron, and then we want to go to the light," now," now," now," and then you go to the legs, and then this arm, and then this arm, and then this arms.
It's about this.
Hopefully more comic than that.
This was .... I don't know what happens.
If you're going to sleep and a few jobs, and you can't have a few jobs, you can't say that you're not going to be a lot of the United States, but in life, "10 years," you're going to be completely completely come from the United States.
The next question that's opened me, "Who is, all photosed to all photos?"
And yes, so pretty much all photos, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is all the first photo, which I've done, and that was also the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of my painting. I had not even my periode.
I know that's going to be pretty personally, but I was a young girl.
So I just looked at a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is I'm at the day, this shooting.
My friends had to stay with me.
This is me on a pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama.
This is I'm going to football-timeam and in V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's artructs and it's artructs of profession, from profession, from Hairlists and photographs and photographs and photographs and all their approach and all the ideas and the construction.
Okay, asking people ask me, people ask me, "Is you always asking me?"
Yes, I've been working for many 20-Abs that I never met away that I never met, but the things I'm going to be able to talk about, things that I'm not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge and a day, I went to a laden, and I had a laden, and you had the clothes forget.
And as a teenager, I'm going to be a free, and it's a fire, and they were survived a redular fighting, and of course, and it's just a question, and we could only further, and we could further.
I have this cost of my personal things, I don't get to my personality and not because of my personality and there's people who don't know how to personality of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last devices and filters, 85 percent of the black and latinos and latinos and latinos and mostly young men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men and latinos that don't say, "Who I'm not going to say, "Who I'm going to be able to do?"
But I'm going to say, "How often, I'm going to give you? When I'm going to give?"
And I found my researchers, I found out that 53 percent of all 13-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-old.
The last question is, "How is it, how is it is, it's a model of model?
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit more dinner, and longer you're very happy, you feel very happy and felt very happy and fabels."
And Backstage, we're answer that maybe we might be able to food.
We say, "It's really great, and it's great, and it's greative, inspired to work inspired to work."
Everything is true, but it's just the story, because what we never might never says, because what I never said, "I've never been told me, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, I feel like, "I feel."
And I feel like I'm sure because I have to think about my exactly.
And if I'm going to ask, "What do I want to be happy when I was lucky and longer legs and longer?
And then you should make a few models because they've got the thin, because they've been the most free and the most coolest coolest coolest coolest, and they're the most coolest coolest coolest women's going to be able to see the planet.
When I was not signed to ready to tell me that I'm very difficult to make a very difficulty, because one of the picture of a very uncomfortable, and I felt really uncomfortunately, and say, "I got all the brought me to my grandchildren." And I was really felt. And I was really felt.
It was very difficult to be very difficult, a suppressive biggest and rass of open, when I'm one of the bigger nutrition.
But I'm happy and I'm going to be here, and I'm going to be here, and I'm going to be here, and I've been here, I've been in the past 10 or 30 years, and I would not be filled, because I wouldn't be like my career, because I wouldn't be like to tell youn't say, because I't say, because
If you take out of this talk to this talk to this talk to this talk about the power of the power of the imagination of the implications and mistakes more likely.
Thank you.
I've been the words of my grandmother, which is never been in the exility of life, "Son, lifi Widafi Widafi Widafi Widafi Widafi Widdafi Widafi Widafi Widafi Widafi Widafi Widafi Wida
But who never been to be as a gaddafi Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, almost two years, since the library revolution is inspired by the wave of the wave inspired by the way in the egyptic revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, inside and outside the radio, and I'm a day of the norns and to start a revolution and to start a revolution of Gadaffis.
And it was, she was a big revolution.
June, liby women and men standing men in the first series of the first slogan, hold slogan of the freedom, and social general giveness.
They've been used to use mother, by using the brutal dictatafirectatur Gaddafis.
They've been a strong sense of solidarity, from the farming oast, until in the south.
And finally, after a time of six months and almost 50,000 type of war,000 tyrane and freezing our country and the tyrane and the tyrane.
But Gaddafi, but a big big big big big big dynis of the tyrannei, and the basically for corruption and the reason for course.
Over four decades has gaddafis Tyrannian regime, the infrastructure, and the moral structure of the lybic structure of the lybic society.
The consciousness and the challenges of challenges, I found out how many other women who were so many other women who are repeating away from lybia, and we're going to make away with devices and neverthal equality.
And so, 200 organizations were during and unmed and unmed and unmed to the case of Gaddazi, almost 300 in Benghazi.
After 33 years in the exility, I got back to Lybia, and I started to Lybia, I started to the same thing, I started to the topication, human development, human development and leaderships and leaderships.
With a wonderful group of women, I found the peace of women, I women, a movement of women, leaderships, leaderships that are public life that's public life that is a public.
And I met the paying, I met up a very difficult environment, a environment that was always polarized by the Egoistic politics of egoistic politics of Dominancial politics.
I lived a policy women's powerful women to reach a women to reach a laws to reach a laws that any citizens, and to be a laws that we should be bad and citizens and citizens and citizens and citizens and citizens and c
At the end of our initiative and successful.
Women women women to the national National Women's been in the first choice.
But long, the euphories of euphories and the entire revolution of the whole range of the whole day, we went to news.
And one morning, we wake up to the money, we're going to changes and sufi-Gral.
And one other morning, we were surrounded by the morning of the message and the message.
And again, the morning of officients were recorded to the poor.
And really, we're looking at the heart of milixed by the milize of military and their power and their power and their power and their power and laws and laws.
Our society, involutionary, in a revolutionarized polarized and founded by the ideal and principles and principles and principles, social Genderness.
Intolerance, excussion and rest of the icones of the icones of the revolution.
I'm not there today today with the successful with the success of our reversion and the numbers and the choice.
And I'm a lot of time today, I'm as a nation that we've been wrong choices that have distributions.
We've been wrong with our priorities.
Because the choice, the choice or security or security or security in Lybia.
Hat the running of the rivers and the white and the white and men and men and national female female war and national level?
No, she didn't.
What is it?
Why is our society is going to polarized and dominated by self-dominant politics of the dominance, and the dominance of men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been done, but the female of the female of the middle of the middle of the middle of the insight.
Our society has to have a national dialogue and consumptional distribution as they've been brought the polarization and decision and decision and decision.
Our society has to have the qualitative requalitative remarkable than they need to be the numeric, quantitative requirement.
We need to listen to the name of the name of the name of the roll and a day of the roll.
We need to start in the name of the middle of the middle of the gnade.
We need to develop a female discovered, who would not just followed, but also would also be simply, but also too, but also together, collaboratt concerts, instead of concerned concerned,
These are the ideal that's a visual war, which is a frame Lybia, to reach peace peace.
Because the peace has a alchemic and in this alchemy, and it's about the feminal sense of feminal sweets.
This is the real remarkable river.
And we need to do that, we need to do this, before we do it sociopolitical.
After a trial of the Koran "Salam" -- Fried "ister's the word of the barmers."
The word "rahead," that's going to get in all the time," which is known assume, the same Arabic Wurzel like the word "mbolized," and symbolized, and the whole female of the whole female of humanity, and the whole thing that's mence of humanity of humanity
And just as the mother of the motherlebryo, which is growing in himself, completely the basically, the whole existence of the whole existence.
So this is why we said, "My Gnade, all of us."
So this is why I said, "My Gnade has been predictioned by my grand."
Now, all the guns of the guy of the guy.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, I thought that I knew that song with the longest "Nothing" on the song.
And I was very proud.
In school, we're looking at the story of climate, but we learned, but we learned that America, except that America, America, South Korea and Japanese.
And although I was often asking my eye, I thought, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea to a northern life in North Korea.
And I saw years, I saw a public having a public habitat, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to live myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought my mother was a letter of the sister.
And that's what you're going to be here, our families, our families, because we've been in this world, because we've been since weeks.
We're going to start together and our bodies are so hard to such a body."
I was so high school.
I heard to hear the first time of them in my country.
And I went to the board, I went to the board and I didn't see something that I don't get anymore.
One living woman lages on the ground, and a high school in their arm, and a blicket in their mother.
But nobody would hold it because all of them were all so that all of themselves and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hungry in North Korea.
At the end of north Koreaner's millions of north of the victims, and many otherwise, and many more than they're bridge, because they're boom.
And so, stronger, always been half after that, so that's all sorts of china on the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the U.S.
I always asked me why she had no lights, and we didn't.
This is a satellite of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the river of the river of the flymrocast, who's between North Korea and China and China.
As you can see that the river, the riversity of his face, and he's possible north Korean.
But many smart.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't say a lot about how I can finish, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I can removed to change the hungry of China.
I thought I thought I was a short time of time of my family.
I never thought it was 14 years to live 14 years to live back together.
In China was very hard to live as young girl without family.
I had no idea of it, as a north Korean, as a north Korean flyinger, but bald. But balds, but I think it's not just extremely hard to be very hard.
So I lived in stronger, I would live my growing, and you would be able to flying my wrong, and you would be able to North Korea to North Korea.
One day, I was bigger alptraum, when I was true when I was brought by Chinese police and in the police and in the police.
Somebody recently, North Koreanerina, so they did my Chinese and asked my Chinese and asked me to ask me.
I had this fear, I thought I thought I thought I was exploded.
Would be awas unnatures, I could be sort of course, I could be evaluating.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I thought it was to control my feelings and remaining the questions.
After they were asked to asked to say, "That was a remote a false.
It's not North Korean."
And they loved me. It was a wonderful.
Some North Koreanera in China in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police and required and related.
This girlfriends had lucky.
And although they were expective, they were free, they were free, they were free international pressure international pressure.
This north Korean, not so much lucky.
Every year, the north Koreaner in China, and after North Korea, where they're followed, where they're going to be able to be highly high-shaped.
And although I had been lucky, it's not going to be a lot of other northern North Koreaners.
It's tragic that North Koreaner's might be survival and hard to survival.
And they've learned a new language and working and working their world, can be in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the most distribution, I decided to South Korea, and I got a new life.
Mich in South Korea nobody was a larger challenge, when I thought it was a bigger challenge.
English was in South Korea so important that I had to learn to learn to learn.
And I've been the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all the Koreaner, but inside the inside ourselves, we're very excited by 67 years of part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the technology.
Identually, Identity.
If I'm south or North Korean?
Where I'm going to come from?
And it wasn't a lander, there was no lander, that would have my home.
And although, the anpassion of the southern Eastern life, I had a plan.
I'm already for the task of the university.
And I'm going to be a new life, I was able to pick up a bright, I got a shock.
The North Korean Behind, the money that I started my family, and as a street, and as a street, and as a street, and as a powerful place.
They had to fast as possible as possible, so I started her flight.
North Koreaner has to be an incredible streets on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to the border between North Korea, Ironically took a flight, Ironically returned to China and made me back to the north Korean borders.
Because my family didn't have to talk about 2,000 miles, I had to south, and then I had to South Asia.
The business is a week, and weeks, and we were almost remained.
One of the bus once was a chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the exercise of all, and he started questions.
And I didn't understood, I thought, I thought they would be family.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided to turn it out and said that they were taking itself, and I would believe her to suffering their attention.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but lucky, but I believed me.
We were sleeping it up to the laotic borders, but I had to brought the border of Laos.
But even after we had the borders, my family, my family inhavior, because Illegaler borders.
After I had money, and I had a money, and I had been payed my family in a months, but I was briefly in the main repeated in the mainstad of Losaft.
This was one of the biggest back of my life.
I had done to family to family to family, and we were so close to the family, but my family, just my family.
I went up and family between the police and the police and trying to family, and I was trying to family, but I didn't enough money or money or money or money or money or money.
I lost all of my hope.
And I asked the voice of a man, "What's losing?"
I was completely surprised that a free-making.
In broken English and I recognition, I recognition and without my situation and without a bank, and he went to a bank, and two other numbers and two other northern Korean, and two other northern Korean,
I thanked him from all the heart of heart and asked me, "Why do you want to help me?"
"I don't help you," he was going to be.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The review is symbolized for me took a new hope for me took a new hope that the North Koreaner, and he showed me the friends of free with the free of freezing and the international community of the north of the north of the northern Engineermunity as the n
And finally, after our long journey, my family, and I returned to Southcorea, but the freedom.
Many North Koreaner's done by their families and soon as soon as they come to a new country or even not a little bit or guy or guy or guy.
The international community can help us to help us, the English licensation and many more.
We can also be able to change the bridge of people in North Korea and the outside of us in contact with families, and we're sending them information and money, and we're helping them information and money, North Korea.
I had a lucky, so much help and inspiration inspiration inspiration, I hopeful north Korean, to successful northern United Stational United Stational United Stational United Stational United Stational United Stational United Stational United Stational United
I'm sure you're a lot more successful North Koreaner on the world, and also on the books on the book.
Thank you.
I just have a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of today.
Please don't tell me that I'm not normal.
Now, I want to imagine my bridge.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't talk about it, but he's communicated freely, like some of the best red memory.
Remi white is love.
He's part of it, and he's participants, and he's uncomfortable.
He's not a lot of it. He's not skin.
He doesn't care about religious difference, and I'm not just tell you, and he's never been a light.
If he's lower from our childhood, trying to remember that I don't even remember one thing: how little thing we need to know about the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He's a absolutely unfortunately.
But he also has a six.
He can't remember if he was my chocolate war, but he's remembers, but he remembers of each songs of every songs that we had been able to have conversation, as four, as four of all of the bridge of all the bridge of the bridge of the bridge of the bridge
Did they don't be incredible?
But many people don't have a lot of people.
And in fact, because you don't understand in the society of normal value, they're often, they're often wrong.
But what my heart, and my soul, and my soul, although this was that the case, although they were not as a case, even though they were not as a case that they could just be authority -- they were extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary.
Now, for those who are not socials that don't trust to reefs," it's a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, and sometimes the social communications, and sometimes learning.
It's extraordinary individual, it's remio is Remi.
And the world's going to be 20 minutes in a new person Autism, and even though there's one of the most fastest growing developments of the world, there's no known as a couple of the world, or health or health.
And I can't remember the first time I remember the autism, but I can't remember, but I can't remember.
I was born three years old, when my brother than my brother, and I was so on, and I was so on.
And after a few months again, he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and it actually didn't really interested in me.
Remi, and regulated in his own world, with his own world, and he found found found founding, and he founding things like the little bit of how to make cars in a set of the room, and what might be in the room, and what it's food.
And as he was older, he was different, and the difference, and the difference.
But the wood, the wood and the wood and the frustrating and never been a really briggest hyperactivity, and unique, and unique, a boy that had been looking at the world without the world, a human, a human, which never been a human,
And it's extraordinary.
Now, I can't live that there were some family, there were some family in my family, moments I wished that I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like.
But I'm going to come back to the idea that they've learned me to the things that they were considuality, communication and love, and I don't understand that things I wouldn't want to be normality.
Normality is the beauty that's beauty, and the fact that we're not being different, and the fact that we're not that one of us.
It's just a different way of rather than any kind of rich.
And when I just want to say to Remi, and I couldn't be a sample, it wouldn't be normal.
You're extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the difference that we have a business, we have a business. And in all the ears in all the early, and in all the strangerality is the ultimative victims of potential.
The chance of chance, running and walls in the moment where we try to be able to be different.
Please -- you're not saying that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has led us with edgs and neuriosity with this photo on a projectil, and with this photo on a projectility of just a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times fast, and we see the world, and the world, but a million or a billion pictures per seconds.
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography femto-Footography, a new educational technology that they can make time, that they can make time.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the absits of our sights or without a race of sights or without a rest of our body, and really in our body, and really in our body.
If I'm going to take a laser potentially, and I'm going to take away -- that's more femtoseconds -- that's more femtoseconds -- that's a photon, and that's going to be a millimeter.
So if you take this projectil, this photones project, and it's in these flashed in these flashing boton in the rivers?
How do you see light in time?
So this whole eventually eventually --
So, think about it, that's all the eventually, the whole eventually less than a nanosecond -- so light, and so light, but I'm light, but I'm light, but I'm light, but I can see the factor of this video.
No, Coca-Cola coca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-Cola coca-ca-Cola coca-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-Cola-C
So, in this movie, so much, so much, so let me show you what happens.
The puls, our projects, we tried to move in the river, a photonespaket, and that starts to move and the finally inside.
And one part of the lights outside the table and you see this exercise of the wave of the wave.
Many of the photones of photones, the last last last, and exploding explodes in different directions.
As you can see, there's air, which is air, which is in the river.
While the wave breads on the table of the table and white the reflection of the reflexions of the reflexions of the rivers are focused by the focused.
If you take a end of projecture and it's the same street, and it's the video back to the video back to the factor 10 billion, you know, how long you have to see how long you have to see how long you have to see the film?
Are week, a week? No, a very last year.
This would be a very long film -- from a long movie -- from a long projectil in movement.
And how do you see it with something still silence fiction?
You can see how these wave the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's when you're a sentence, we're going to be a part of the power.
I'm going to be as if the nature of nature as a photo males, the photo males, but of course, but of course, but of course,
But if you look at this domate, you'll see that when the light, you're going to remain the tomate, this is going to remain this one. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the tomate is reify and the light and the light and after a few million seconds.
So in future, when these femto-camera in your camera in your camera in your camera, it could be able to make it possible, and if you can make it in a fruit, without it.
So how did my team at MIT, this camera?
So when you know, when you know, if you're a photograph of picture, you have a very few light, but we've been a billion light, but we're really fast, so fast, so you get a light, so well, so well, so well, so good as well.
So we're doing this project, we're sending this project, this photonized, and we're going to show you the very clever and recording together, and we're reconnected to record this female to tell you that female the female to show you the female that female that female.
And we can take all of these roheds and so interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can make us feel like, but how would it would be a new superfect for a new superhery bright superher?
The idea is that we're doing something light on the door.
It's going to go back into the space, a part of it, a part of it, and we reflecting the door, and we could reflect this more simplications of lights.
And that's not Science fiction. We've built it.
Links, you see our femto camera.
Here's a puppeared, and we're going to leave the light.
After our attention in the "Nature Communication" was published by nature.communication, it was from nature.communication.
We're going to get these lights, and they're going to get them together, and they're going to get in all the directions of the photones, and some of the photones that are going to reached ourselves, and then the lights that will reach the lights, and then the lights.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our femto-co-camera has some single camera.
It has a very good time, and it can look at the world, and it can look at the world.
And so, of course, we know, we know, but also the door, but also the most victims, but we don't know what we don't know what the dotion.
Indeed a laser on the bottom, we can see a Roh-Picture that -- how do they see it -- how do we see it -- not really sense, but if we're looking at these images, and they're trying together and trying together, and they're trying together, and they're try together, and they
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit of doing this, we can see the practice, we can actually build the practice, we can see the collisions, and we can see what the collisions, or we can see, or we can see what the course of lights, or we can see in the lights.
But because of the blood and building is very, of course, of course, that's really a way to thinking about female, is now a way to think about female, now, and now, because a new bright probably the next medical probably the next generation of medical probably medical picture of medical picture
So, as well as a scientists, even a scientists, and we can't have a scientists, and that's a art, and that's not just a message of the ultraphy, and that all of these gaby, and that all of these giants that we're not just smartments that we're not just not just not just not just not
But it's happening here.
If you look at these waves of the rivers, you see that the wave, you see that the wave of us.
The wave to us to move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we've been almost in light, because we've been able to have a same effects and astone, and one incredibly learned this image.
The range, the rest of the event in the world in the world, in the world, in the world in the camera in the camera, so that you can make the relationship of space and time you can correct the distribution of space, we can correction.
So, even if we're going to show you whether or the exploration of a new creatures, and we've been able to remain the medicine or new data, and we all have to requirements and datails.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many opportunities, how our middle of our lives.
We don't make any neighborhood, so that many ways, so many ways, so many ways, we're using the same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighborhood and sharps and crosss, slime.
The projects of my questions, how much might be like many mine, how much might be my neighbors?
How can we listen to more things without us, without us?
How can we leave our memory of the memory of buildings and the country?
And how can we share our hope for houses, so that our communities, so that our communities and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea is going to be bigger embrace that's been hundreds of years, the hundreds of years, beds and tears and tears. I'm trusting town.
I think every time, every time, any time, there's no one parade, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings, but it's also the city of the world, but it's also the city in America.
I'm going to be able to do this house, and I've been wrong. And I thought I thought that I thought that my life for always changed.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved very much.
You were Joan, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, and it was suddenly and unexpected.
I've been thinking about the death, and I'd been a big disease, and I took me to my life, and it brought me in life.
But it's hard to me, this is a hard, this is a day.
It's easy to lose in the Alltages and what really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I wrote a side of the lose of the luck and wrote a huge tails, and I want to take a sentence, I want to take away."
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could expect, but I was the next day, and they were completely completely filling out of the wall.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to be smart piratterns."
"Bevor I want to stand up, I want to stand up the International datums."
"Bevor I want to sing for millions of people singinging for millions."
"Bevor I want to send a tree painting."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netting"
"Bevor I want to send them in my arms, I want to hold it."
"Bevor I want to be slight, I want to be somebody."
"Bevor I want to be smart, I want to be myself."
This is after place that was remained to a sense of place, and the hope of people and dreams and dreams, and the laughters and drive me as the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not all.
It's about our neighbors and understanding and second to a new way and in a new way.
It's about place, place for remembers and remember, and to remember what we're really important, and what we're growing and change us.
I've done this last year, and I've been hundreds of economics that were building with their community, and I wanted to build my colleagues and now I've been built in the world, and now, and now, and now, and now, like artifica, South Africa, South Africa
We've been shared how much power our power of power, when we have the opportunity to share our voices and more with other people.
Two of the most valuable things that we've been time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever, it's important than ever thinking about the right bubble of the right blewing and realize that life is cried.
We're often out oftended to talk about death or even thinking about the death or even thinking about it, but I realized that the proposition of the death is one of the death is one of the things that are strong.
The thought about the death is used to death us.
Our common samples of places that are important, which is important, and as individual. And with more important. And with more opportunities, and stories, and stories that can't help us to help us to help us to help us to help us better place them better places, they can help us to hel
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to turn to me to approached mathematics. One of the problem for everyone who are considered mathematics, is that we're like companies.
Nobody knows what we're actually doing.
So I'm going to tell you about today, today, I'm going to explain what I do.
Tanze is one of the human activity.
We're decided to be awful balletting ballett-time might be same.
For Ballettle is an extraordinary big massive big big mass of capacity and ability to have a basic componential eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually.
Traurbships like parkins, like parkins like parkinson long-contential capacity. It's also doing it with my moved Jan Stripling, who was a ballettuitude.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the mission.
And yet, there's a world, there's 6.3 million people who live in this disease, and they need to live with the unconscious symptoms like symptoms and other things that we need to live in the disease.
We need to figure out whether order to know if we can use, and last, and we've got to know if we've got a single possibility, that's answer to be answer that this question.
<unk>ress is that there's not a parkinson and other movements can't just a biomarker, so you can't just a simple biombs. That's this 20 minutes.
You have to turn it into the clinics. It's very expensive, and that's very expensive studies, and that's never been done.
But what if patients would be able to do that, could make this destinction?
That would be a very hospital tour in the hospital. What if patients. What if patients?
It wouldn't be a teures hospital.
It costs 300 percent of the neurological action in neurological action.
So I want to tell you a unconventional method, and we're trying to reach that we're all trying to reach the senses of senses, in some senses like my replings like my repling.
This is a video of video of vibrating vibrating vibrating.
This is what happens in health, when somebody language, we can look at us as a stimular ballettle, because we've got to look at all of these voice, because we need to coordinate laughters, and we all have to movement.
And as ballet, it's enormous.
Think about how long a child, as a child, until it's learning.
And so we can relate the position of vibrating vibrating vibrating. And as the morganisms of parkins of parkinson's also the voices of parkinson.
And the example of the involved you can see an example of unregular voices.
We're always seeing the symptoms.
You're going to be swarmor, switch.
The language is going to be a level of time, and that's a symptomsymptoms.
This is affects of the voice, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, but with digital microphone and presence of the microphone, and more combined with new sources, and now we can actually fixed with new limits.
How can these tests with clinical message? Well, they're both of them are both in neurologists.
And they're slight. The infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. There's not being the voice is not by experts.
So you can be constantly removed.
They're very quickly, three times 30 seconds.
They're very brilliant and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can use it in big massive.
This first amazing question, we can reach it.
We can reduce logistic skills for patients.
Patients don't have to leaders in clinics in clinics.
We can remember if we can remain the objective data.
We can make a couple of massive massive studies, and we can get a clinical studies and first of all the population of the whole population of the whole population.
We've got the possibility to look for Biomarkers for the disease of the disease.
Today, we're going to do this direction, we start to do the parkinson's settimming.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high-day, we're going to take a very high-dates to start enough to provide the earthquake of these goals.
We have space, we have the dreams of a billion people on this planet, people on this planet.
Everybody, or without parkinson, or without parkins to get a few center to get a few center. I'm going to get a few center, we've been already in the real stranger of our goal.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people say,000 people say, who says, who's healthy, who isn't it?
What do you do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients have to give you approach, whether these parkinson't have to parkinson't.
Some people don't maybe it's not to make it.
But we collect a huge database, different database, undermination is important. This is important. This is important. This is important, because we're really important to fixed to fixed to parkins that are actually the real marker.
Two-cent definitely, right?
It's much better.
My students, I have to love him, because he's so fantastic worked -- now, now, now, now, now, now, now, that it's also working on the mobile phone, and we're going to work on, and we're in 9 percent.
This is what I call a connection.
This means that people can do -- people can make people -- people can make the test, and people can make people with parkinson, people with parkinson, their voice, so that their doctor, so that you can represent the disease of the disease of the disease.
That's what we're doing.
Thank you. Thank you. Max Life, my dams and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
So here's what I live in Kenyair of the Nairobi nairobi-National Parks.
In the background of my father, and the cower of my father and the nairobi-National Park.
The Nairobi-National park is just in the south of the south. That means that Wildlife, that Wildtil the parkets of each one of the parker.
The running, the solution, the solution, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that were made up. I was wake up. I was wake up and found it was a great. It was ourselves. It was our only buy.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we believe that we came together with our animals, and the way together, and so much. That's why our animals.
And I learned to mean that I learned.
Our warrior warrior, you're going to be used our stamm and our stamm and our hearts. They're bright.
and they kill the solutions.
Here's one of six solution that were in Nairobian.
And I think there's a lot of time, there's only so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so
In my stamm is a boy between six years, and neine years of his father. That's how it was also for the cow.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Feuer. Lions for meching fire.
But then I realized that wouldn't really help us really help us to see the solution, but the cows to see better.
But I didn't go. I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to try to a bird.
I wanted to think that the solution, I thought I'd start.
But solutions are very cleaning animals.
They come to see the birds and go back. Because they're going to go back and say, yes, and they're not, and yes, yes, that's still there.
And they're going to kill our viety.
One night, I thought I was a packle in the case of a packle in the hand, and that's not going to be the solution.
So solve forching light, which is moving.
I had an idea.
She was working with a little boy day, I was working all day in my room, and I took the new Radio my mother Radio my mother. And I had to be almost. But I had to be almost a lot about electronics.
I took a old car, and I'm a radiation of a motorrad. The motorrad. It's right or left or left.
And I was best, I was a switch to switch the light and out of the light.
This is a little bit of a bit of a caps.
And then I built all of this.
The solar panels the battery, the battery, the battery, the battery. I call it a transformator.
And the right thing.
You see that the birness of the birth, because of the solution, because of the solution.
And this is what it looks like the solution, when they come.
The lights and the light and the solution, I believe that I was going to believe the stall.
Thank you.
I've been so installed installed and since we had no problems with solve.
And then our neighborhood.
One of them was this great thing.
She had a lot of their animals in the lose and she said, and she was asking her lights installing the light.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the light. They can see the solution. They can see the lions.
And so I've been working on the neighborhood with the lights and they're really good.
My idea is now used to be used in all the crosssss, as hydroparent or Leoparning or leopards. The lights.
My experience is a stopped me to a stopped schools in Kenya, Brookhouse in Cenyse in Cenyse in Cenyse.
My new schools and helped and helping and helps and helps and recording.
I even brought my friends with my friends and common slightly where we're not going to show where there's no, and I'm not used to use them.
I just a year ago, I just a boy who was savanne, who was slight. I saw Flane, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a sitting in a situation!"
And here I'm going to stand here.
I thought to airplane to airplane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a big, I want to be airplane and Pilot. That's my graph.
Fromers, I've been able to remember my invention, I can return the cows of my father, and we can live in side, side without side, without the solution, without the solution.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, I thank you.
You know, you know, it's not what it's like your story, it's a story like your story.
So you've got this starts to do this stuff.
You're working on other electric inventions.
What is the next one on the lister?
So my next invention, now I'm working on a electric cave. Onectroza. Onectroza.
Yes, I know, electrical cities are already have been found my own, but I want to figure my own.
You've been already trying to try to kep -- Yes, I'm tried to get the trying to give the trial, because I got ...
Everybody's hard. Richard Turere, you're a very best particularly best.
We're going to be infect your way, your friends, my friends.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm since I'm a camera in the hand, is photography, I want to share with you today, but I want to share with you today, and I don't want to share with you.
There was no way of Director, no picture, no chance, no chance, not even the picture. Not even the painting.
And in fact, mostly, mostly, mostly, mostly, mostly,
My story starts when I was a talking about a talk about a talk in New York, and my wife, and my daughter, and I was birthdaying on my arm, and we were at the end of 57sters and 57sters.
And so we were a year later, we were able to look at New York and so we decided to look at the same picture.
Now, you can see what you can see.
When the third birthday, my daughter, my wife, "Hey, why, why, why don't you're not New York and makes it a father-down, to lead the ritual force?"
And we started to make a picture of tourists, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's noticed, as universal, as universal face is when you're going to be a volume.
Nobody has never said, no one is also never been lucky, and somebody's never done with our camera.
And we didn't know how much these rice, how much these rice.
This journey is very hold.
This is only weeks, only weeks after the 11. September, and I had to understand what happened on the day.
These images are much more than just a fixed moment, or a particular moment.
They're also a way to refuse for a weeks in the october, and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical, not just physical, but in all of us.
Because always doing this same image, changing our perspective of miles. While they're always seeing new miles, and I think about it, and how they see the life with their eyes, and how it looks like it.
