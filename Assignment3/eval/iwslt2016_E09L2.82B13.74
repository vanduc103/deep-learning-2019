When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the closed by the closed.
My father heard on his little gray, gray, gray, the news of the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual, and it was pretty unusual, because the message of the news.
He called "The Taliban are fine!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father obviously, very happy.
"Yes can go to a real school," he said, "That's right.
I'm not going to forget about.
A real school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I spent it was girls, and then they're girls.
And so I was small, I was five years, and I started my older and I started my older sister, who don't get anymore, to a secrets.
And just as we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way to get another way, no one couldn't get anyone.
We hidden our books in the books in the books, we would just look like this.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small walking room.
In the winter was incredibly, but incredibly hot.
We all know that we knew that we were risked our lives: teachers and our parents.
In the repeated the difference, suddenly for a week, because the Taliban decided to the Taliban decided.
We were never sure what we did.
Do they follow us?
Did you know where we live?
We had afraid, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a big deeply lucky to growing as important as important as important as important.
My grandfather was his time.
As a carrying out of a decided province Afghanistan. He was to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and he was sending his father.
My given mother, but my mother, teachers.
That's what they do.
Two years ago, they went to the rest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhoods.
And my father -- this was the first thing -- the first in his family, who was ever received a schoolbook.
And for him, it was sure that his kids would be a children would be a children, but also his daughter, despite all the risk of all the risks.
He looked like a much larger risk of a lot larger risk of kids.
I know that I'm sure that I was in the Taliban sometimes, sometimes it was from our lives, and the perspective and the perspective lossibility,
I was like to give you a good lust. But my father said, "Taughter, you can hear me. You can lose your life.
Your money can be done. You can be distributed in war.
But one thing is, you're always staying here. And even if we're staying with our blood for your blood for your blood for your blood for your school.
So -- you still want to still?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than 6 percent of the women of my age of my age, age, and when my age, and if my family, and if my family, and if my school powerful powerful powerful possible for my school.
Instead, I stand here today, as a standing as standing here today's a college.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was my grandfather who was taken by his family because he was to school, because he was to school, one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first.
He doesn't just like my high schoolables, but also I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman who was the first woman who was driving him.
My family believe me.
I have a big dreams, but my family has a larger dreams for me.
And so I'm global messages for 10x10, a global campaign for 10x10,
And so I've help, SOLA, SOLA, and maybe the first and maybe a single Internative in Afghanistan, a land, a land, and still girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students of my school with great early with great ears with great early chances.
And to see how their parents and fathers and fathers for them, as well as my parents for me, and I'm going to make all the time.
It's like Ahmed. This is not his face, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
A couple of a month, and heavy, and heaven, and heaven and they're the village, and they're just took a bombs in the road.
When he got home, he came home, and he sounds, and a voice threatened him, if he sent to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "Till me, if you want to sit me, but I'm not going to sit down to the future of my daughters to play out of my olderly and overhold imaginations."
What Afghanistan, I realized something like this, I realized something that's in the West, the most of us, most of us who have a father who's a father who is a father who is a father who is that their daughter.
It's not succeed that our mothers don't play a very important role in our success.
These are the ones are holding, they're involved in a much more convinced for a much more convinced their daughters. But in a society as the infghanistan is the inevitable.
Our Taliban to the Taliban girls, because it was some hundred maybe it was the girls.
But today, but in Afghanistan, three million girls of girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America,
The Americans are recognize how we change.
I don't think that change not by Dauer and change the crashed with the U.S.
But if I looked in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents that they're going to make them a lot of them, and then I see a much long-produces a much long-long turning a long turning a long turning a long-long wall.
Afghanistan is a land of hope and the hope and the unfortunities, and it remember every day, and I remember the SOLA.
And that's what I have a big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, I'm also asked my life -- my life -- my life -- my life in Africa as young man.
In 1971 to 1971, I see, I'm not -- but I don't -- I've got in Sambia, Kenya, algeries and Somalia, algeria and Somalia, and technical countries.
I've been working for a nRO, and every single project that we put on the legs that we put on the legs.
I was a doubt.
I, two1 years, thought we were to be good people are good people and good work in Africa, and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we killed everything we started.
Our first project that my first project, which my first book, "Ripples," inspired," inspired by the Sambias, inspiberia, as nutrition.
We came together with Wian Saatgut in South South Asian South Asi-Flussi fleetching the sambia. We're leading the population of the populationalian tomata and Zucini.
Of course, the answer to the answer, so we don't pay for the work, so we didn't pay for the work, and sometimes they also turned it on.
We were just astonishing that there was no so early no landwork.
But instead of question, why they didn't say anything, we just said, "God, we're here!"
"Gerade, right now to save the right time to save the people who save the people."
Of course, of course, in Africa.
We had this practices. In Italy, they were so big, they were so big, in Sambia so big.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Looking, "Look, like simple landworld."
When the tomata, and red, and they were about 200 nights, and then the rivers and wondering everything.
We said to the Sambian: "Oh God, the Nilp.
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have a country."
"Why didn't say, "You don't say, "You've never asked us."
I just thought we were just, we were so great in Africa, but then I looked at what the American, I did what the Englands, which made the French, which was pretty much what they did, I was pretty strong.
We felt like, we found the nilp.
They should see the unfinished -- you should see the uncomfortable of African people.
They should read Aid, "Tead Aid" by Dambisa Moyoyoyoyoyoyoyo.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have a countries have been given the African continent 1.5 trillion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has this money.
Let's just read your book.
Let's reading from an African, which we've been strong.
We western people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, and there are only two species, and we're patriarch.
Both words from the latines from the latines," which means "Father" means "Father"
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalic: I'm treated a different culture, as if they were my kids. "I love you."
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone each of another culture,
And so people are called Africa, "bwana," Chef,"
I was growing up when I was a book called "Small," by small," by small," he said, especially, if people don't want to help.
This is the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help of the help.
Today, the morning of the heart of the conference that conference, and he asked a stab on the ground, "Can you imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to people, and I was invented to a system called companies, and never heard of the nevertheless, no one's ever going to be initially a service, but you're going to be the service of the services.
What you do -- you're going to do is the mouth.
You never reached a community with ideas, you're sit down together with the same way.
We don't work from office.
We're going to meet in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Cneips.
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally finally find out what the personality and find out what the person.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can someone can be a idea.
If that person doesn't like what should you do?
The passion for the passenger growth of person is the most important.
The passion for the passion for the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge, because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea has not the idea, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, why I had this instead of community instead of saying, and people say what they shouldn't hear about why don't we hear them in community.
Let me give you a secrets.
There's a problem with community.
Intern entrepreneurs, and they're never going to say what they're going to do with their money to see what they want to see.
Planel has this blind flow.
The most smartest people who don't know, you don't know, because they never seem to be open.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, to be social infrastructure out.
A new reportion to create a new job.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the house, who is in your house, in your house, and in your caf<unk> sitting in the caf<unk>s a way to transform your passion in a way that you can make the life.
I have this in food in its in its trying to try to try to try to do this.
I was promoved to the time and trying to make the time, which we're going to say what they should do.
And so I walked in the first year, and I had only three days, and I had three days. I was half of my first customers, and he was half of fish in a garage, and I was half of a restaurant in Perth Athanthaurant in Perthanthanth and doing.
I think that's what I'm going to work together and that wonderfish, and this wonderfish, and they were selling a Fabric in Albany for 60 cents, but after Japan for 15 dollars, and then they said, "Hell me and said, "Heybuy.
In a year, I had 27 per year. The government. The government, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I hold the mouth and hold it."
So -- so -- So -- so the government: "Make it again."
We did it in the worldwide in 300 communities.
We have 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are insight.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, one of the best companies, a few years ago.
Peter pressor pressor, Philosophype of companies before he was business. Peter pressure, Peter pressure, Peter Peterminable with an unfairs and the economy and the economy and the economy."
Planel is the death russ of the entrepreneurs.
So you built a Christch, without know what the clocks, which is the clocks with their money and their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to avoid.
You have to give them discretion and privacy, and you have to help them to help them to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who imagined and the intelligence and the passion?
For what predict what the presentation, you have the most applauday?
<unk>Trator, the passionate, you have applauded.
I want to say that companies saying that companies.
We're at the end of the first industrial Revolution -- nicherbles, fossil fuels, fuels, and suddenly, and sustainable.
The turning powerful machine is not sustainable.
The Fron-Art of instanding is not sustainable.
We have to look at the seven billion people look at seven billion people on after the sustainable way to cure, transportation, and we can correspond to them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will the technology for the green revolution? Universities? Universities?
The government? Because you're you!
It's going to be entrepreneurs.
I read a food story in a fooduristic magazine a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were in the future of the future of the city of New York in 1860,
In 1860 came together, and speculated in 100 years with the city of New York, and the city of New York, and the city was a city, the city of New York.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population in this tempoint, they needed to be six million pathways six million pathways to be the human beings, and it would be impossible to be able to be six millions of six millions of six millions of si
Because they were already in the master.
1860, they see the worst of New York, which is the life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001 cars in the U.S. 1001 car.
The idea, another technology, and the running, and there was a little factory of little factory in the backland.
Desborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secrets to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing that you have to be retion to them.
Otherwise, they don't talk to you.
So when you have to relate them, you have to definitely engaged and empowerful service.
And then you have to tell them the absolutely truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the smallest company to be able to sell you all have to sell you, three things: that must be able to sell the product, the power, and the financial market.
Do you know?
We never met a single person who can sell the same time, and sell something, and sell the money, and to sell the money.
It's not exist.
This person was born.
We have research, and we looked at 100 iconically, we looked at the world -- Carnegy, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford the new fords, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle,
There's just one thing that all have a successful companies of the world, just one: No, just one: No one person.
Now, let's teaching 16-old in Northumberlands of entrepreneurs, and we start to give them two sides of Richard Branson Autobiography. The first two-year-olds. The first two-olds.
No one time, and 32 times "wir" and 32 times.
He wasn't alone.
Nobody green a company, no one company. No one.
So can we make a community?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you sell it on the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Maybe you're you that I think someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have a groups of volunteers who can be support the companies, and they can help them to help them to help them out of the middle of the middle of the intelligence of the intelligence of the population of the population and the culture and the culture and the culture and the culture and the c
Thank you.
I've got to be five years ago, how it must be in the wonderland, alice in the wonderful.
Penn State University, I asked me -- a Docentin for communications -- in the communications -- in communications.
I was afraid.
It's afraid of this students with their great brains with their big brains and their big books and their big, not trust me.
But as the conversation of the conversation, it was like Alice, as they looked like Alice, and he looked down to the canniny, and a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I was talking about the students. I was just a students. I was amazing about the thoughts that they had discovered that other wonderful.
I think that to open up to open up to open it, it's great communication.
We need independent communications of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers, and the largest problems that are the largest problems, like energy, and if we don't understanding, and if we don't understand it, and I don't understand that it's nothing in our conscience than science than science than science than scientists
But these great conversation is not to come to our scientists, and in their scientists and engineers and engineers.
So scientists and engineers, please, please.
I want to show you a few anti-down you can see it instead of how you can see that the science and technology and technology and technology and the technology and spaneous.
The first question that you have to answer to us, and?
Say, why don't just know why you're relevant for us.
Don't just say that their dragoning, but also says, but also says that you can also treat us that you can see the massive structure in our bone, because they can understanding oxygen, because they can understand oast.
And if you make that describe what you do, then you're avoidet Fachward.
Afterwards are a handships,
I mean, you could use your doctors, and they useful, but why don't just say why and why and time, and why and time, and time, what's much different for us?
Our idea of your thoughts, is not the same as their nive is not the same as their nive.
As an instein was prepared to say, "Mach things like this, but not just as possible.
You can tell us a little bit about your scientific areas of scientific areas, without getting a compromise without getting a compromise.
A few things are involved to retreat, examples, stories and analogies. It might be able to pulling us in your banned.
And if you're going to do your work, then you read the story.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's called "Stich Point."
What happens when someone else? As you get to another one, and then you get to the first time, and with these points.
It's not just like this is not just slowly, but also in the long-locking part of our brain, and we're going to talk about our brain, we're fast.
This example of genes of genes of genes, and it's much we're much we're much more we're so structure of the traffic, it's so stability is that they even the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration.
The trick here is to use a single simple, just to use the public sentence, when it's audience, orientation, orientation.
These are just a few anti-conts that can help us to see this door, and the wonderlands and the technology and the technology and technology and technology.
And the engineers I've been teaching me to me, I've been considered in me," I want to make anything with a same contact with a same with a same with a same together.
And you can see, you know, you know, your stories and your stories, and your piece of the relevance, so you can say, so the audience, and that's important, and multiplicated to the whole works for yourself, and it's incredible work. And he's incredible working. And he's.
So scientists and engineers and engineers, if you've got this equation, I'm sounds me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy can break a cell phone in Syria.
With a handy handy, you can start a protesta, and a protesta.
And with a handy handy, you can take a song, it's high-Cloud and famous.
All of that is possible.
I'm a year 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in those city.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people for change in the streets and the streets and the street.
We're in 1989 and imagine, and we've been involved in the cell phone, and change a handy in the cell phone.
Who in the Saal has a handy?
Hold it up.
Hold your hands, you hold, you holding it up!
Hold it up. It's another blackberry, wow.
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy and my handy and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 cells.
Rohdata.
And why are these information?
Because in 2006, the E.U.K.
This relines is called Rightlinia is called the presence.
This direction is that every phone is that every phone in Europe, every Internet, every Internet, every Internet, a bandwidth of Bandbrewide bandwidth.
Who's going to call a pick? Who sent to a piece?
Who short, why is a text?
And if you use a handy, where you're used to be.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years of your phone, or your phone or your Internet, or your Internetanbield.
And everywhere in Europe, people are saying, "That's what we don't want to say, "That's not."
They said, we want to say, we want to do this idea.
We want to be self-building in the digital time, and we don't want the phone, and we want to be information about all these information about all of these information about us.
There were answered, Journalists, Piester who said, "That's not going to say, "That's not."
And here's what you can see, like thousands of people on the streets of blin streets, "Freedom,"
And some people said, you might even say, this could be in 2.0.
The stasi was the secrets in Easti in East.
And I asked me, I'm really works.
Can you really know all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone called my phone, the Germany, the greatest telecom, and I was the largest telephone, and I asked them, and I asked me, and I asked me.
And I asked them, and I asked them and he didn't get a real answer. Nural Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bl
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is protocols.
So I decided to make a decided to remotely to remote because I wanted to have this information.
But the Germany telecom said no, no, we're going to give you this information.
And at the end of it came to a compared to them.
I'll just pull back to what they're all send me all of me.
Because in the twice of the bundamental crimination of the E.U.
So I got this hold this high-classive environment.
And on CD: this is.
35.830 pieces of information.
First, I saw it, and I told me, it's a huge datei.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this datei.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I start with it?
Because you see where I'm, where I'm, where I'm doing.
But then I said, I want to go to the public information.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people what I want to show you what it means.
So with time, with time, and open data City, so I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reminzoomen and out and out and out and you can predict the way.
You can make any step, you can do any step.
And you can even see how many founded by Frankfurt with the stuff, and how many answer, and how many answer.
All of that information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just like this, and I call my wife, and we're talking to each other.
And then I called me a few friends and they call a couple of friends.
And after a while you call up and you call it and you call this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate people with each other, they're going to communicate, when they go to bed.
You can see all of you can see all of this.
You see the central figures, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to these information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect defection, how to grow a society about who knows who can talk to who is a long time, who is a possible when you're going to have access to these information.
And these information are going to be seven months, in the Europe, in Europe,
As I said to the beginning, we're going to put all these people in the streets in the street in 1989 Handy in 1989 hands.
And the stasize of who had been to be who had been in the demonstration of what happened, and if the state of who would have been the leaders, then maybe that would never happened.
The case of the mountains maybe not stattle of maybe not stattle.
And it's not the case of the ice case of the ice.
Because today, because of information and companies and companies, as many information, how they can get to wrong within.
They want to have the opportunity to remove our lives, and they want to remain the long time.
But even in the digital and a life in the digital time, and age.
But you have to be the self-buildings today.
They have to fight every day, you have to fight.
So if you go home, you say, you say, you're friends, you know, a value of the 21st century is not old-century.
If you go home, you say, you say, you're just because companies, just because companies and state the opportunity to specific information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you're asking your phone to the information that they've talked about you.
So in the future, every time you use your handy, if you use your handy, you remember that you have to remember the self-digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoids, snaurants, brestaurants, bridge.
So the city planer, and so they're survived the Named South Central, so that it's change for something else, and it change in South Los Angeles, what's going to change what's going to change what's going to be wrong.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituogenes, short, short, brestaurants, brestaurants.
It's like 26,5 million other American living in the food, I live in the eating South Central Los Angeles, and the drive-bys.
The comic is that the driving driving more people killed than the driving bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles.
The fat, the father of my fourths in my fourths, five times more than about 15 miles, which is about 15 miles in Beverly Hills.
I couldn't see that.
And I asked me how you would have a healthy when you didn't have access to healthy when you see any time you see any moment, if you see the negative effects that are the best effects that are the best fourth of your fourth system.
I'm going to sell you that role in the collection and selling as well.
I see the dialysis of dialysis, and I see starbucks.
And I've got to stop that this is what it's got to stop.
I caped that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And then I had no light, I didn't have a light-minute round apple to get apple, not with pesticides in the presence.
So I plant a food-wood woods ago.
It's a piece of land that we call Parkanles.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is the thing is the city is the city.
But you have to flew it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I have to stand it."
And I decided to kep it into standing.
So I came up and my group, and my group, and we started together, and we started together, and we started to plants, and own, and the own program, so the whole program, so the whole program.
We're a kind of a paper group, we're city, and all of social signs, and it's completely free, it's completely free, and everything we do, and everything we do.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone.
The city city came to me and he was practical approached me to say that I had to say that I've got to a rich prediction.
And I thought, "Come, really, right?
A richters are awful anticipation of foods on a piece of land, that's going totally matter?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The L.A. Times windows of it. Steve Lopez, and I talked to the city of the city of Green Right? They were a member of green ground. They were a petition.
We thought you could think of the hands.
My city rather than they're actually support it and said they're support it and love what we do.
So why wouldn't do that?
L.A.A. has in the United States most brought in the city of the city.
They have 67 miles 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flowers to plants to plants to plants.
Why is it shouldn't find it okay?
and by a plant of a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 -- 10,000 sample.
With green boating in the value of a dollars, you're own value of 75 dollars.
It's my holy, I say, I say they should be able to build their own food.
His own food is to build your own money to print your own money.
Look, I have a powerful in South Central.
I grew up there. I grew up there.
And I remember, part of this prepared reality to be regular reality, and I fabrician, and I fabricity.
Look, I'm a artist.
Gardence is my graffiti. I plant my art.
And just like a graffiti coast, the walls, the walls, I think, beautiful, I'm a parkanels.
I use the gardens that are the Earth, and the plants, and the plants and the trees, and the trees for these stuff.
They would be surprised what the Earth, if you can use it as a line.
They can't imagine how he's amazing a sunlums, and how they're touching people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my gardens to an instrument for the instrument for the fourth of my fourth.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wonderful how kids are going to be affective.
Gardens is the therapistic and coastal and coast, especially with the city.
And you know, you get earthquake.
I remember this time, when this mother, and her daughter, it was about 10:30, it was about 10:30. They were in my garden, and I came out.
I was really badly bad, because they were really bad because they were there, and I said, "Well, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not own reason on the street."
I've been looked at me when I saw people who were so close to me, and I was just asked me to do this. And it's just asked me, "Fin, you don't have a fear."
And I said, "Tum Puff, no, I don't have afraid.
And it's not too is on the street.
But that's the idea.
I want to take it back, but I want to take it back to me, I want to take their health."
I was a different time, I was a garden in this observed in this observed LA.
These are the guys who have helped me to reflect the laster.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how they've been influenced with her mother and how they flew their grandmother, and it was great, and it was a great moment.
Green grounds like 20 gardens of 20 garden.
And we were came up with our environments, and they did, and they're all freedom and they're all freedom.
If you children carbon, it's children.
If they're taking tomata.
But if they don't get anything about it, if they don't get done, how food, how food and body, and they're blind, and you're blind, and you're blind them.
I see young people who want to work, but they want to stick, but they're looking at this thing -- I see, and I see the exactly the path, and that's what they're never seen.
The gardens, I see a opportunity, where we can train these kids to care their communities to care of their communities to feel after life.
And if we do that?
We could bring the next George Washington Carvernment.
But if we don't change the collapse of the Earth, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole hit a whole harms, where people can share the same blocks in the same blocks.
I want to take schiffscontainer, and they turn them into healthy Caf<unk>s.
So, don't understand me.
I don't talk about costlessly, because costless is not costless.
The comicated thing about neighborhood is that you have to kep them through them.
I'm talking about how people are working to hope, and kids from the streets, and they're going to leave the streets, and then you can experiences when you own food, and if you open your own farmers.
So what I want to do is to do is to make this exy to do.
I want to be that we all want to all ecological rebelling, gangster gangster.
We have to make the image of gangsters.
If you don't have a gangster.
Gangster you get to 'They, right?
And let's get the waves of your choice.
If you want to make meeting meeting meeting meeting meeting meeting in the cool, and you want to make a meeting, and you want to make a meeting,
If you want to meet meet you want to come to your garden, in my garden, so we can sort of pitches.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite sounds in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster.
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No," means "No,"
While it's a century in 19th century, and it's better definition, "It's a better than a century, someone who is an attention, independently, program or light, program or long-time monkey.
I don't have an idea what "speakeral."
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians that they're trying to control.
For example, for example, for example, the British Parliament, not the exactly the words, the debate.
And that was actually going back to the mother's going back to the man with the man's extraordinary name Brass Crosby, who was involved with the Parliament.
They were him in the Tower of London and he was a muthority, but he was mutigh enough, he was muty enough to smart enough he was so much in London he was so much in London that he was so much in London.
And only a few years later, we find the first message for the first message of the sentence, and a lot like Brass"
Brassed on the English word for book.
But that's not true. It's going back to a reference.
But to show you how to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you to the United States, when they're just to the United States.
You see, you looked at the question about how to call George Washington, which is called State,
You didn't know.
How do you call the a leader of a republican nation?
It was infinite longress infinite longress.
And there were all sorts of all sorts of possible proposition.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernur Washington, and others, and others, and others, and others, and other, and other, in the United States of America Washington.
Not as a presentation.
Some people wanted to call him simply nice.
They thought that was aware of it.
They were not even monarchistic, they wanted to choose the kingdom.
It would have function.
But everyone was unpreciated, because these debate, because these debate, because these debate.
I have the days of a senator of a senator who is still the same is, "Immmmers.
The reason for the relationship, and the long time, and the representation,
The representation didn't want to do that whathington, what's going to do.
Could call it, and they call it, and we're still going to be able to bring it on ideas.
They wanted to him, they wanted to give it, the most extremely give them a great thing that was a fellow.
This title was "President."
President. They don't have the title. He existed. But he's existed, but he's suffering a vision.
It's like the predicted a jury.
He didn't have anymore than the recording "As" or "Aprops" or "Apasser."
Sometimes, there were president smaller colonial communities and government groups, but it was really an indeed.
And so the sence of the senate.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't president.
This guy is to write appears and exploring and countries.
Who will take it to take it to take a thumbs, like President of the United States, "America?"
And also after three weeks, the senate of senate.
Instead of course, you know, the title of the title of the course of the course, but they didn't want to make sure that they didn't want to be honestyle of their opinion, and they're not avoiding and methods and methods and methods.
You can learn from that three interesting things.
First, I think that's the best -- I don't have to figure out if the senately, whether the title president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just reading the title.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something temporary -- then you know, you know, you know, you know, 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, the most important point of the United States of America," ordinary, right?
This has more than 5,000 nuclearly, and it has to do something that he's got the largest volcular volcular volcular drones and a picture of the world.
I mean, and story, and the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of size of the s
And so the senat at the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end.
They have a respectables title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of the sense of the time, it was that.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the candlearly '5,000 nuclear pounds, and so on.
So at the end of the senate and the representating and the representation, because no one who feels, because no one who feels that you're going to be the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with what I'm going to do with.
Politicians to use words to control the reality to control the reality and the reality, but actually change the reality of Worlds, the reality of words, the reality of reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster of about 50 rebelling a campaign to campaign -- a 19-old, a 19-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I was a thousands of my black Converse half-shot couple of lands, and celebrator and celebration panzer, I couldn't even see.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was a long time, I was a long time, and I was going to play with the same pyjama Pyjama, and the walls and fights and rassistic southern Cinders and religionalistic southern Commonstrations,
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to put this, I'm citizens, Southeists, Southeist, and atheist, and atheist, and atheist, and atheistan, who's been born, who's been working in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do is to make art, but I don't like any restore, I don't like to make a personality. I want to make the personality and carries and car and car and car and returns out and returns out and returns out.
I want to spend a day in life of a distance, I want to spend his dying his dihad, like "Popstar Bling" and popular bling," and political corruption and political corruption and political corruption.
And what else can do is to make the Derminister, as a country, and a choice and a choice and a choice and I'm doing with the slogan: "Whad and I'm doing myself."
And try to use these campaign to use these maybe to remove these magnitude that are remove.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and they're called "Ref," and they called "Revaluate," and you're wrong with a wrong control streets of cabular cars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan, I wanistan, I think, "modic conflict.
The war and the war and the foreign approaches, who came to a new environment, and a new environment, and models that you can only a model of soldiers, by such a models and self-mattledating settledge of the fellow of the fellow of the fellow of the fell
And I'd like to see how a simple shoots of cabular cabular cabularly, and it looks like a dialogue to create a dialogue today's a distribution of the past minitiative evolution of the retiative of the retirection of the retiative develop
But for all of these things, you can get in the prison, they can be misunderstanding, they can be missing.
But I do, because I have to do because I have to do it because the own self-long.
That's my last. What's your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I've been working as a model.
Since 10 years, right.
I have the feeling that now in the room, I've built in the spanted, because I wouldn't have this clothes.
Fortunately, I have something to change something to the way.
This is the first time that someone who's the first time on the TED stage, so you can see, so you can see, so I think you can see.
If you were really a few women were really exploring out when I wasn't need to say that now, I don't read it to Twitter.
I also think I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds, because I can think about 10 seconds.
And it didn't have the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I wanted to make them,
The most difficult part is to pullovering my head, because then you're going to pullo, because then you're nothing, so long as it's nothing about my head.
In order.
Why did I do that now?
That was a personal.
Now, it wasn't hopefully as this picture.
And one of the powerful, but a surface, but it's also an image.
I just have just changed your opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this image -- I had never really never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photographer, I told me, and I would be solve my back in my hand in the hand in the hand in the hair.
And then, from operations or the wrong bridge, or the wrong brunch of two days ago, there's only very few opportunities, and we have a few opportunities, and our quite and our own lives -- although it's operating and unless.
To being approach to be honest today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I stand up on this stage because I'm a high school, and I know a woman, and in my branches.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that means nothing.
The real reason I was a model, is a minute, and a mattery and maybe a important earthquake and maybe you're going to ask you to see what this is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have a healthymetrically not just as healthymetrically defined, and we're biological programmed, but also as a biological, but also finish and highly.
This is a created for me. And it's a result of me.
I know there are people in the audience, and I think there are some of the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some maybe, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls."
And first, I'm going to comments, I know. Shark. Shaking.
But unfortunately, I have to share that in 2007, a very experienced Doctorand of the NYU all the models on the single mold, and that was booked by 67 or less than 67 or less than 27 or less than 27 or less than 27 or less than four percent.
The next question that I'm always said, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm a mathemat?"
And first of all, I don't know, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to girls really girls really girls, why?
You know what? You can be? You can be.
You can be presidentin of the U.S. or the inventor of the next Internet or a ninja Herzchirurg-Dicher, because then you would be dead, because then you would be dead.
If they still think about this great telling, "No, no, no, no, I want to say, "No," I want to say, "Who."
Because I don't have anything, and you couldn't have to the Chefredacts of American business leaders or the next same.
And you say that you're going to be a model, you'd like to say that you want to say that you want to win the Jackpotto.
You can't affect it, and it's not a career, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, because you know, knowledge of the idea of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart.
If you look back there, and you can just go back there, and you can just as a nice, and you're going to be a nice, and then you want to go to the cameron, and then you're going to go back to the legs, and then you go to the legs, and then you go to this arm.
It looks like this.
I hopefully than that in the middle of the middle.
That was ... I don't know what's happened.
If you're finished and a life, and you have done a few jobs, you can't say that you can't say that you can say that you want to be presidentin of the United States, but in the United States," you'll be able to look at the United States.
The next question that I'm often being, "Who are all photos?
And yes, so pretty much all of the photos, but that's just a small part of the story.
This is all the first photo, and that was doing this, and that was also the first time I was the first time I was a bikiniode. I didn't even have my periode.
I know that's pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
And I just looked at a few months before, with my grandmother.
I'm at the day, I'm on the day.
My friends had to start my friends.
I'm in a pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama, a couple of days ago.
This is me with the football team and in V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you see that these images don't see pictures of me.
It's constructs and it's constructs of a group of profession, from Have and Make-up coasts and photographs and stylists and stylistants and the piece and the predators and the predators.
Okay, askay, people are always asking me, "Car I'm going to say, "Can you?"
Yes, I've never been able too many 20-cm-common, but the things I'm not going to be, but the things I'm not going to get things that I'm not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went to a day, and I was in a launched my money, and you gave me the clothes.
As a teenager, I was in my friend with my friend with my friend, and they were red law, and of course, and of course, and of course, and it's just a couple of waiting, and we could go on.
I have this cost of my costs of my exceptions, and not because of my personality and there are people who are personality and there are people who don't know because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and they were filmed in the latinos and latinos and latinos and latinos and latinos and most of men.
It's live in New York only 17,000 young, men's not the question, and latinos, "Who I'm not going to ask me?"
So, how many often I'm going to holding? When I'm going to stop?"
And I found my rights for this talking about this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States. And these numbers.
The last question of myself, "How is it, how is it?"
And I think they expect them, they expect, "If you're a little bit of thinner, and you feel long, you feel very happy, very happy and fabulous and fabulous and fabulous."
And Backstage, we give answer that maybe this impression.
We say, "It's really great, so much to be greative, and it's greative, inspired, inspired people."
All of that is true, but it's just the story, because what we never say, because what we never said, "I've never said, "I feel what I've never say, "I feel like, I feel like, "I feel safety."
And I feel like me, because I have to think about my exception, because I have to think about my exception.
And if you ask yourself, "Would I be happy, I'm happy when I was final legs and longer legs?"
And then you should make a few money, because they have the thin, because they have the thinest legs and the most coolest harm and they're the coolest clamothes, and they're the most of their expects on the planet.
When I didn't even say, "I've been very difficult to tell me a honest, because one of the honest, because one of the stage, because one of them, and I was really uncomfortable, and I got to say, "I got all the benefits. And I got it. And it's felt. And it's the most forever.
It was very difficult, it was very difficult to relatively difference and race of biggest non-sized nutrients, if I'm a largest nuts.
But I'm also happy and I'm not going to be here, and I think it's great, and I think it's great, and I've been able to do this, and I wouldn't be able to be remember, because then I wouldn't believe my career, because then I wasn't tell me how to tell me how to tell me how to t
If you take a talk to this talk to this talk to you, we all have the power of the power of the image of the image of the imagination and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never forget my grandmother never forgets that are never forget about life, "Son," is, living in the Exili Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi World him.
But who never to be like a gaddafi Revolutionary revolutionary."
Now, it's almost two years, since the library revolution of the waves of the waves of the waves of the waves of the waves in the Egyptian revolution.
I was spending me with many other lobyers, inside and outside and outside of the Libyens to type of the corns and to start a revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Now, library women and men and men and men in the first range of the regimes, the end of the regimes, the freedom, and social general skills.
They have an example, they've provided mother by taking the brutal dictature Gaddafised.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the east, from the most farms, until the south.
And finally, after a while of six months, and almost 50,000 takes us, and we're going to stand our country and tyrane.
But Gaddafi, but a big citizens, a large corruption and the corruption and the corruption and the reason for course.
Four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannic regime, and the infrastructure, and the infrastructure and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The desertifying and the challenge and the challenges, I realized how many other women, like so many other women's civil society of loybia. We've been recording to Democracy and never memocracy and negative.
To see 200 organizations were during and unmed and unmed, and in Benghafidence in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After three years in the exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a unique, and I started to organiasm, I started to organiasmshopshopshops, human development and leaderships.
With a wonderful group of women, I was the peacebuildings of women, a women, a movement of women, leaderships, and it's public public public strength.
I met the popularly, I met a very difficult environment, a collection that always polarized by the environment. It's a politics of dominance and exploration.
I was suffering a set of peace-controlling the women and women and certainly achieve a law, and a law, and no matters, and no matters, and the right, and the right, and to choose.
And then we were recorded to our initiative, and we're successful.
Women women women,5 percent of the Nalkongress in the first choice for 52 years.
But slowly, but the euphory of euphory of the wealthy revolution, we thought we were growing up to news.
So a morning, we wake up to the money, we're going to change the suffering and Sufi-Gral.
In another morning a message on the murdership on the messages and the message of the message.
And again, again, the morning of officients of the army.
And really, really, we're going to grow up under the milize of milize their minds and their minds and their missing and their power and their power and laws.
Our society, our society, and it's why we've been polarized by the ideal and polarized by the ideal and principles, social skills, social genderness, social genderness.
Intolerance, exploration and Rach, and Rach, and Rache, the Icones of the revolution.
I'm not there today today with the success story of our records of our redesigns and the choice and the choice.
So I'm here today, I'm here today, as a nation that we've met, and the wrong choices.
We've been wrong our priorities.
Because the choice of peace, nothing stability or security or safetybia.
Didesign the records and the white and the women and the women and men and men and national peace and national peace and national peace?
No, it didn't.
What is it?
Why is our society is going to continue to the dominated by itself, and the dominant politics of the dominance and the dominant, and the women?
Maybe the women't the only thing that has dropped, but the female values of the middle of the middle of the including and the including.
Our society needs a national dialogue, and consumers, and consumers, and the choice, and the choice, and the end of the end of the end of two decision.
Our society needs the qualitative recruitative requality of the Weible, quantitative requantitative requantitative requality.
We have to stop in the name of the name of the name of the roach and a day of the roach.
We have to start with the name of the middle of the middle of the gnade.
We have to develop a female discourse, which is not just a following values, but also to do it, but also to work with the roach, instead of report, instead of collaboratts, instead of statts.
These are the ideal that is a common crowds of war, which is to reach peace to reach peace to reach peace.
Because the peace has an alchemistry and in this alchemy and in this alchemistry and mines and maskulines.
This is the real rowing redesign.
And we have to do that existence, before we do it before we do it sociopolitical.
After a vers from the Koran "Salam" -- Friede," "ist the word of the barmers, raise."
The word "rawing," and then all over against all of the same as well, and all of the same Arabic we all have the same as the word "rahem" and symbolized the word "minute, the whole feminal feminal humanity, and the whole humanity, and the whole humanity, and the f
And just like the motherle of the embryo, which is growing up in him, so it's so nutrition of the middle of the middle of the middle existence.
And so we said, "My gnade, "My gnade all things."
And so we said, "My gnade, "My gnade."
Maybe we're going to be the gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country, and I grew up with the long, and I grew up with the songs."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were powerful story of Kim Il-ship, but we didn't really much about the world, except that America, South Korea, South Korea, and Japan our enemies.
While I was often asked me how the outside of the outside of my life, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, to a change.
And then they saw years, I saw a public he looked at the first time, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to live myself.
But in 1995, my mother was a letter of letters of the Sister of a college.
Darin stand: "If you're going to be five five five five family members, because we've been for two weeks.
We're going together and our body and our body, and we're soon as well die."
I was so shocked.
I heard about it, I heard about that people in my country.
And I went to the bothofully, and I went on my memory that I couldn't solve my memory.
A live woman living on the ground, and a board, and a piece of their arm, and it's the face in the face.
But nobody didn't think they were so that allowed to care about itself and their families and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big children's a big chorea.
At the end of north Koreaner of the hunger of the hunger of the victims, and many other than they were just because they only because they only because they were just because they were just because they're bags.
In the case of the case, always been holding myself, so that all sort of the lights, except the light of China on the other side of the other side of the other side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the s
I always asked me why they had no lights and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea, and his neighbors.
This is the river of the river of the Amrocovering between North Korea and China and China and China.
As you can see, the river of the rivers, and it's very simply north Korean.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't say much about how I can say, but I can say, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I could turn on the hunger.
I thought I was thinking that I would be a short time from my family.
I never thought that it would never thought it's 14 years to live back together.
In China was very hard to live in China, without a young girls.
I had no idea of what would be a north Korean finish rivers would be soon as a northern I'm not just extremely difficult, but also it's not just extremely hard.
So I lived in strong in the strong idea that my realized that my realized me in a terrible school, and you would go back to North Korea.
One day, my biggest alptraum, when I was liked by the Chinese police, and in the police of the Chinese police.
Somebody relatively, North Korean, so they test my Chinese cold my Chinese and asked me.
I had this kind of fear, I thought I was exploding my heart.
If you could sort of course, I could be innatural, I could be inside, and I could be inside.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I did, I did, but I did, I felt my feelings and answering and answered.
After they were asking them with the excited, a case, "That was a false.
It's not a north Korean."
And they love me. It was a wonderful.
Some North Korean, some North Korean messages in China, but many of Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and records.
These girls had great happiness.
While they were expected, they were expect, they were finally finally finally finally finally international pressure.
These north Korean didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, unfortunately, in China, and in China, and after North Korea, where they're followed or public, or publicly hard.
While I was lucky, I was lucky, it's not so much other north Korean.
It's tragic, it's tragic, and they're hard to survival, and hard to fight.
And then, after they learned a new language, and works in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the hidden of the purpose of the South Korea, and I started to go back to South Korea.
Mich in South Korea, I never report, a larger challenge, when I thought it was thought it was thought it was thought it was.
English was so important in South Korea, I had to start to learn to learn.
And I started took the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all the corean, but inside ourselves, we have a very expecting, we've been in the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the text.
Islands a identity crisisis.
Is I'm South Korean?
Where do I get? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country more, that my home.
While I was not approaching the south Korean life, I didn't easy, I had a plan.
I'm prepared to the attention to the university.
I'm just as I was in my new life, I was a new life, I got a bad called a bad.
The north Korean body, the money that I started my family, and as a street, and as a street, and as a streets, and as a street.
They had to fast as possible as possible to planning her flowers.
North Koreaner has to be an incredible strong to their way back to the freedom.
It's almost impossible to over the limits between North Korea, Ironically returned to China, and I got a flight back to China and I got to China and I got to China.
Because my family, I had to talk to a chinese, I had to suffering in more than 2,000 miles, and then I had to Southeast Asia.
The busycled a week, and week, and we were expecting more mentioned.
Once, when the bus once, a Chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the evidence of all, and started asking questions.
And I didn't understand Chinese family, I thought they would be family.
When the Chinese related my family, I was decided to him, and I told him, and I told him, and I was told her job.
He looked at meisstrauic, but happy, he thought he was happy.
We did it created it up to the line, but I had to do this, but I had to border to bordership to borders of Laos.
But even after we had the bordership, my family increased, because of illegal bordership.
After I was paid struggled, and smallery, my family inside of a months, but I was in the months, my family, my family in the mainstadian city.
This was one of the largest running my life.
I had done everything to family to family to freedom, and we were so close to the family, but my family, just before the South Korean message.
I went down and I went down between the police and the police and trying to substantly trying to family, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money or money or money.
I lost my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man, "What's rid of a man?"
I was completely surprised that a friendly care of it.
In fact, in the English and with a words, I explained my situation and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two more money and two more north Koreaner to get them out of the prison.
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he didn't.
"I help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The most popularly removed foreign for me to a new hope for me to required to me, and he showed me the North Korean friendly, and he showed me the freedom of foreign and the international community as the hope.
And finally, after our long journey, my family and I recorded to record, but the freedom.
Many north Korean, from their families, and soon as they come to a new country, and so once they're not going to start with little bit of money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us learning and many mountains and many mountains and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea, because many of us in Korea, because many of us in contact with families, and we send to help them information and we send to help them to change the hard, northern Korea.
I had a lucky, so much helpful, and inspiration in my life that I hopeful north Korean successful northern Corean success.
I'm sure you're going to see more successful north Koreaner in the world, but also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a bit.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good at the great.
It can't talk about, but he can't communicating on a way of the best rather than some of the best rather than that.
Remi is what love is love.
He's part of it, and he's sharing, and he's unknown.
It's not gone. He's not attention.
It doesn't care about religious differences, and you're just going to tell you, and he never told you never religiously.
If he songs from our childhood, when he was trying to remember the words, I remember one thing: how little bit about the important thing: how little we know about how little bit about the unknown.
Samuel is 16th is big. It's very good.
He has an absolutely unfairable memory.
But he also has a selective.
It can't remember if he remember my chocolate war, but it remembers, but it remember the public longer, conversation that we had four, as he was four, when he was four, when he was four, when he was four of the telets of the teletism.
Do they don't hear about it?
But many people don't true.
And in fact, because it's not in society of normal version of normal paste, they're often getting wrong.
But what my heart, and my heart and my soul, and my soul, although it was the case, even though they didn't seen that they couldn't be an extraordinary, that they were extraordinary, and extraordinary,
Now, for those of you who don't trust the people who don't trust the terms of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, which is social communications that are social communications that are body and sometimes.
It's also extremely different individual, and it's about it, and it's different than Sam.
And the worldwide will all 20 minutes in a new person autism, and although it's one of the world, and although it's one of the world, there's no known as a familiary.
And I can't remember the first time I'm not remembering autism, but I can't remember, I can't remember it.
I was borning three years old, when my brother, and I was born, and I was so excited to my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play how it didn't really interested in fact, and actually not really interested in me.
Remi lived in his own world, and he found in his own world, and he found my own rules, and he found like the smallest things in a set of a set of a set of the rooms in the room, and all of it.
And when he was older, he was different, and the differences were different.
But behind the water and the walls and the Frust and the hyperactivity was something really unique, and it was a recordable non-conscious nature, a boy who had never seen the world without a human being.
And also, extraordinary.
Now, I can't live that there were some of the moments in my family moments in my family, moments I wish I wish I wish I was like I knew they were.
But I'm going to go back to the ideas that they've lead me to the done that they're learned me to communications and love, and I don't understand that this is not going to be sounds that I wouldn't want to turn out.
Normality about beauty, the beauty, the differences, and the fact that we are different, and the fact that we don't mean that one of us.
It means that there's a different way of relatives.
And if I could only be a thing to say to Remi, and then you must be, and then it wouldn't be normal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, autism or not, the differences that we have a story, and we have a story. And in all of us have a story, and in all the striveness, and in all the victimate open-potential.
The chance to the size, research and walls and walls in the moment where we're trying to be different.
Please don't say that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has a honesty, and neurosurosity, and neuroscience on a project of apple picture of apple picture of a millionth of size of a millionth of second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and see the world, and see the world, but a billion pictures per second.
I'm going to show you a new way of photography, the femto-Femto-Femto-field, a new approach is that they can make time light in the movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build appearance of our views or without a <unk>-ray or without a <unk>-ray, and really can ask them in our body, and really in our body, and really, "Kamera.
If I take a laser potential, and I'm going to take a billionth of seconds, and that's more femtoseconds -- I'm going to create a package, and I'm going to breaking a millimeter, and this project, and this project, this project, and this project, this project
So if you take this projectil, this project, and this photones, and it's going to take this botones in the flowers in the flower?
How does it look like light in time?
So this whole events --
So, think about it, thinking, all of the events, in fact, less than a nanoseconds -- so light, so light, but I'm going to return to the light, but I'm going to see this video to the factor, so you can see that the light.
No, Coca-Cola Coca-Cola.
So, in this movie, so much, so you can see what happens to show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, we driving in the flower in the flower, and then the start, and then the finally, and then the brought inside.
A part of the light, and you see outside the table, and you see these table, and you see these effection of waves.
Many of the photones, many of the last few of the last slow the rivers of the rivers and exploding in different directions.
As you can see, there's air.
While you're breads are the waves on the table, and because of the reflexion of the reflexion of the reflexions of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers.
If you take a projectily projectily projection and it recording the same streets and the video, and then you have to see the video, you know how long you're going to see how long you're going to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long-long movie, a very long-long projectil in terms of movement.
And how does it look like this with something still like a picture?
You can see how these waves, the table, and the waves and the wall, and the wall.
It's like if you put a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece.
I mean, it's like this, as if it's a photo might be a photo matter, but of course, but of course, our eye.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that when you'll see that when the lights, you're going to remain this tomacle. It's not going to remain.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and the light in their light in their lights and after after after after after a seconds.
So, in the future, if these femto-camera in your camera in your camera, it could be able to go into a supermarket, and you can go to a supermarket, and if a fruit, without them.
So how did my teamera on MIT this camera?
So, as a photographer, if you know, if you're doing a picture of light, you have a lot of light, but we've got a billion times faster than your course, you get a light.
So we're doing this is what we're going to send this projectil, this project, and we're going to recovering this project, and we're going to combine these gigabytes, and we recording these femto-to-Videos.
And we can take all of these rowates and doing things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other harders can make us feeling, but how would it be able to see a new superpowerful superheroes: to see events?
The idea is that we're going to street.
It's going to be able to go back to the room, a part of it will reflects, and then we could reflect them back to the camera, and we could use these more simplications.
And that's not a science fiction. We even have built it.
Links, you see our femto-Kamera.
And the wall, the wall is a puppeared, and we're going to leave the door.
After our treatment in the "Nature Communication" was published by Nature.communications, and they've been publication.
We're going to recording to recording together, and they're going to make a little bit of the photones, and then some of the courage, and some of the photones, and then we're going to reach the lights, and then the lights, and then the door.
And because we have a camera, which is so faster, our femto-camera has some skills.
It's a very good time, and it can look at the world in light, and it can look at the world.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the course of objects, but we don't know what we don't know what the distance.
And then we can see a laser on the bubble, we can see a roof, how they can see a rolling on the screen, but if we can see a lot of these images, and then we can try together, and they try together, and they try together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We can also see some of the laboratory, and we can see the lab in the lab, we can see the cars, we can see the cars, and we can see what's going to see, or we can see in the curve, or we can see in dangerous course, by looking for survival lights.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, it's really a way to think that's why it's why it's why I think about femto-Femto-Femto-Femto-Femto-field.
So, as well, like a scientists, even a scientists, and there's a scientists, and there's a collection of the ultra-shaps, and I realized that all of these gigabytes that we can't just know any time, not just knowledge.
But it's also happening here.
If you look at this waves under the flower, you see that the waves, you see that the waves.
The waves to move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we've been able to take almost in light, we've seen, and incredible effects and incredible effects of this picture.
The records, in the events in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, so you can relationships, so you can relationships by space and time, we can use this distribution of space and time, we can correction.
So, no matter whether we should be able to create the medical creating a new data, and we should have been able to required to our invention, and we've all details on our website opening on our website open.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our middle of our lives.
We don't meet any neighborhood, so that we don't have a lot of ways, but we don't use the same public places.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and share things like Aleber, such as a boards and circlones.
The projects, how much mine, how much members, how much memories my neighbors?
How can we start to stopped to stop using anymore?
How can we leave our memories and share the landscapes and understanding and understanding?
And how can we share our hopes for living houses, so that our communities, our communities and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea is going to be huge edge of the huge education that have been hundreds of years, beds, beds and trees. I'm trusters. I'm going to talk about music.
I think any time someone nobody would never be a parade, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the world, and most reason.
I live in the narrative and I have this house, and I thought it could changed my life, and I thought about something that my life forward.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, and it was suddenly and unexpected.
I thought about death, and I thought, and I was a big disease, and I got a big death to me.
But it's hard to me, this sort of views, every day.
It's easy to lose to lose and forget about what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I wrote a huge homeworks and wrote a huge, and I wrote a big piece: "Bevorite, I want to die.
I wasn't sure what I was experiment, but I was experiment, but the next day, the next day, and they're always been filled.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the people who were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to die, I want to be piratrically, I want to be clear."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to stand up the International datums.
"Bevor I want to die, I want to die for millions."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to plants."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to live "netzunabhed."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to keeeep them in my arms."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to be someone."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to be myself."
This is a snake of place, and it was a senseful place, and the hopeful place, and the hope and trees me to the laughters, and during my hard time.
It's about knowing that you don't know anyone.
It's about understanding our neighborhood and in a new and in a new way.
It's about remember, and it's remember and remember what we're doing what we're doing us, and as we growing us.
I did this last year, and I did hundreds of messages of suffering people who wanted to build a community, and so I wanted to build a wall, and I've been building a colleagues like countries, and now as countries like cases, South Africa, Africa, Afr
We've shown how much power our power our powerful places when we have the opportunity, and we share our voices.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world is more important than ever before, the things that are the right perspective, and thinking about it, and think that's life is that life is that life is.
We're often going to talk about death to think about death to think about death or even thinking about death, but I realized that the idea that the idea that the idea of the things that we are at most strong.
The idea of deaths of death is a life.
Our common slightly, and the best, which is important to us as a community and as a community, and with more possibilities, and stories, and stories can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us better places, they can help us better places.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me with applied mathematics. It's a special problem for everyone who are considered to be companies, is that we are as companies.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to explain the try to explain what I do.
Tances is one of the most human activities.
We're decided to the balletting of most of the ballett and soups, and the same way you see the same way you see.
At the ballettle-like a lot of capacity and abilities and abilities and abilities, and possibly a genetic componential events that could have a genetic component.
Traurossibly destroying newurological stories like Parkinson't do this extraordinary. That's what it's also what I did, and that was a ballettuous jany.
And over the years, you know, you know, a lot of research.
Despite a lot of people who are living in the world, and there are suffering in this disease, and they have to live with the unexpected, tremor, tremor, symptoms, and so that disease, and so that we need to make sure that we need to make the middle.
We have to measure the researching objective message, and finally, and finally, really, really, really, if we have a challenge if we have answer that question can answer this question.
<unk>Trorists, there's no evidence, and other evidence, so you can't have any biombs, so there's no simple blood visited what it's this 20-minutants.
You have to do it in clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very expensive, and that's not going to be smart.
But what if patients could make this test to do with this test?
That would be a strong tour in the hospital tour in the hospital, what if patients?
It wouldn't be a teures hospital.
It costs <unk>100 percent, 300 percent, in neurological action.
So I want to give you an unconventional methods, which we're trying to reach that we're trying to reach in a way, because we all know, virtuosen, virtuosen.
So here's a video of video of vibrate stimmlipping.
This is what happens in healthy when someone who created speaker. We can look at the state of a stronger, because we have to look at all of these voice because we have to coordinate all these stimmorganize, and we all have the genes, and we all have the genes.
And as Ballet, it's enormously exercise.
Think about how long a child, how long a child, until it's talking about it.
And by the skin, we can turn the position of vibrating stimulate stimulate stimulate stimmorgane, and the voice of Parkinsoninson.
And on the bottom of the example, you can see an example of unregular stimulation.
We're always see the symptoms.
It's true, swallow, swallow.
The language is actually easier and I'm slightly a symptom of it.
And this is affects on the voice, sometimes, sometimes, but sometimes, sometimes, and the presence of digital microphone, combined with new mediating with new machines, and that's very clearly regularly, we can now see now, we can now see now, we can now, we can now, we
How can you measure this tests? Well, right? Well, they're both of them are not invasive.
And it's not very little. The infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. There's not being true of experts.
So you can be removed by itself.
They're very quickly, three seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also use it in big mass.
This is amazing goals, we can now reaching this.
We can reduce the difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to retrolinic controlinics.
We can make objective data, we can relationship.
We can make a serious massive massive studies, and we can leadership and recording to realize a difference.
We have now the opportunity to look for the first time to look for the disease, before it's before it's before it's before it's before it's before it's possibility.
Today, we're doing this direction, we started the parkinson's Parkinson's slims.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of voices around the worldwide of strange enough to bring enough exciting for the exciting of these goals.
We have a called Ruff that are the dreivated a billion people on this planet.
Everyone without parkinson, can be approaches to get a few center to get a few center for a few center. I'm going to get a bit of our goal in just eight hours of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you say, if you say,000 people say,000 people say, "You can't say who are not healthy and who is not?
What's worthing about all these probably?
What's happened is that the patients, while this person's parkinson, whether these parkinson.
Some people don't get to the end of the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is important. These are important, because we're important, because we're in order to make these parkins.
At the time, you have 86 percent decision?
It's much better.
My students, I have to love it, because he's got to love it, because he showed it -- has now shown that it's also showed that it's also functioned, and we're going to make this project, and we are in 9 percent decision.
I call this a better way to relatives.
That means that people can make people can do -- people can make the cell phone and the test. Parkinson might be able to take their voice, so that they can take their voice, so that you can take the research.
That's what we do.
Thank you. Max Laugh, my dad and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
So here's what I live in Kenya on the southern Randi Nairobi national parks.
In the background, you see the cows of my father's the kitchen is the Nairobi national park.
The Nairobi national park is in the south, just in the south. That means that wildlife, and that means that wildlife.
The regularly, the solutions, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that were killed. I wake up. I wake up, and I found it was awful bully. It was our only bully.
My struggle, the stamm of the massai, we think we're came together with our animals, and that's why we got our animals.
I learned to hate, I learned to hate.
Our warrior is called Moran. They're protect our struggle, and our case. They're actually case, and they're actually case of this problem.
And kill the solutions.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a nairobi- Nairobi- National Park.
In my stamm is a boy between six years, and nine years, and nine years, and it was also the cows.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Lions. Lions for fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to see the cows, but the cows.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to a virtual bird.
I wanted to think that the solution, I was standing next to the cow.
But solutions are very clearly clues.
They come up, you see the birds and go back. And then they come back. But they're going to move the thing that's not, and that's still there.
And they killed and killed our viety.
One night, I wake up the case. I love with a fackel in the hand around and that time, and this time, and this time.
Lions for the lights for a light that's moving.
I had an idea.
And I was a little boy worked on my room, I was in my room, and I took the new room, and I took the new radio of my mother. But I had a lot about the day. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took an old carship and autobattery and a motorcy. The one motorcy. It's right, or left.
And I was worried age, I was a lights and explore a lights.
This is a little bit of a capture of a caps.
And then I build everything.
The solar panels the battery that battery that battery, the battery. I call it a transformator.
And the direction of blind.
You see that the businesses, because of the outside, because of the solutions.
And this is what it looks like this, if they come to the solution.
The lights blinking and the solutions, I think I was to believe that I was the case.
Thank you.
I've been installed this installed installed and since we didn't have a problems.
And then we heard our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had many of their animals, and they lost my animals and she asked me if I could installing the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
Since I have seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights and they're really good.
My idea is now used to be used in all the cenya, too, even for other predators like hyenes. The lights. The lights of colories.
My invention, I'm going to a stip at a stip of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really excited.
My new school, my new school, and helps and helps and helps and religious.
I even my friends with my friends with my friends, and we're using the lights, and I'm not used to show the people, and I'm using them.
A year, I just a boy from the Savanne, who was high-lipped. I looked at me and I said, "I'm going to me, I'm going to sitting in a sitting in a sitting!"
And here's what I call it.
I was like airplane with airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm great, I want to be airplane and pilots. That's my great traum.
I've got a solution, but by my invention, I can save my father's retire the cows and we can save the solution, we can live without side, without strip without street.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language is, I'm thank you very much.
You don't know what you don't know how you're talking about your story as your story as your story.
So you've got this stipingium. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list of the list?
My next invention, I'm working on a electric caunch. Amaza. Amaza.
Yes, I know, I know, electrical dragic draged my own, but I want to have my own.
You've been trying to ready to try to try to try to try to give it, but I've been trying to give it.
Every start is hard Tures, you're a little bit of the best.
We're going to put your way to remember your way to refuse me.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm since I'm a camera in the hand, is photography, but I want to share with you today with you 15 of my favorite, and I don't want to share with you.
There was no way of director, no chance to shoot, no chance too shoot. Not even the picture. Not even the reportant.
To be honestly to be honests were tourists were tourists were decided to the tourists.
My story begins when I was in New York, and my wife, and my wife, and my wife, and my daughter on my arm, and we were on my arm. We were at the end of 57th of 57ths.
And that's what we were later, we were in New York and so we decided too shoot.
Now, you can see what you can see what it looks like.
When the thirday, my daughters of my daughter, "Hey, why don't you why don't you do it a father-tech, and it makes a father to lead the ritual forth?"
And then we started to do this, we started to make a please, a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, how universal, if you're going to be a completely fighting a completely fight.
No one has ever said no one has ever said, and fortunately, and someone with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much of our lives, how much of our lives.
This journey is very holy.
This is just a weeks after the 111. September 11, and I had to explain what happened to understand that a five-old it.
These images are much more than just a finished moment, or a certainly moment,
They're also a way of a week for a week in the october, and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical, not just physically, but in all.
Because even though we do the same perspective of miles, our perspective of Miles, while they're always reaching the life with their eyes, and how they see it with all about how they look like it.
These very intense very intense we spend with each other, and every year we're expecting every year.
Last, as a last, while, we went to our rice, and we were talking about how they're suddenly redesigned it to a red laws on a puppets on a puppets, and they love learned as small kid,
And she told me about their feelings that they had as a five-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-old.
She said they remember how to remember how to the heart of the breast nine years ago, when they saw the first time they saw the first time.
And now they looked in New York to High schools because they're in New York.
And I realized, I realized, the most important thing we all create, memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you, an active role in the memories of memories.
I don't know how it looks like this, but I'm looking at this 15 pictures, I'm not quite a family photo.
I'm always the image.
I want to start to get today today with you today within the image, and you don't you ever asking you, "Would you do a picture of us?"
Thank you.
