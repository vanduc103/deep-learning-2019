My father hard to be small, small, the night, the night.
He looked attraording to do what happy to be able to be able to him, because the night.
He's called "The Talibana.
I didn't know what's what it means it's really happy, but it's very global.
"You can you go to a huge slight," he said,"
The morning I'm going to do.
One of the right slight.
The Talibanists that might be able to go out in Afghanistan, and I was six might be.
This is why I felt like to five years, and I started to five years, and I started to behavior, and it's not going to go out there, and a slime, a slime.
And then we could go to the same back to the school.
Every day, we're going to take a different way that we could never he could take away.
We're going to look at our books in Eftwards that it would be like this, we would go to do a little book.
We were involved in a house, 100 million, 100 might be in a little box.
And then it was just a little bitter, but incredibly, but it was incredibly.
We all know that we're all our life: Let's allowers, create our else.
And then, the difference of the difference, because the difference of the weeks because the Talible forests.
We were nevernments like many of us, how much they were talking about us.
Rad them?
Who they knew where we're going to do?
We had to go, but we want to go, but we want to go to school.
I had great great greater in a family in the picture of the picture of the books, and TV.

For two years ago, they're in the ruhest of our head for mold in a cold, and women.
And my father -- to see -- the first -- the first time, the first time, the first time, the sulful.
For him, it was clear that his kids were a children would behavior, but also would behavior, the Taliban, the trops.
He looked like a lot of greater Risk of the biggest risks.
I know that I'm not in the days, I'm going to look at the early, and the crime, from our life, and the perspective, and the perspective.
I'm going to left today, but I said, "The said, "The said, "The's dues,
And that's the guy can be dues.
But a thing is going to be diring, what's going to do is, and it's going to be able to do with our bubble for you, and we need to do that.
So -- so, you want to be able to do?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.

When are more than 6 percent of my altermost my altermost away, a high-ships, and if my friends. And if my family, and I'm not sure, I'm going to be a women, I'd like a women.
Instead, I'm going today, as a colleagues of the Middlebols.
When I was after After After, my grandfather, the camily, because it was biggest, because it was because it was because it's because it's created his create, a greater.
He didn't just just asked with my high school, but I'm also the first question, and I was in the first question, and I'm going to found that I'm going through the carbon.

This is why I'm believe in 1010, a little bit of a women for 1010, a women.
This is why I've got to do SOLAOLAOLAOLAOLA, and maybe a few maybe in the country, a land, a country, and it's still still still still still still still still still still still still still have still still still still still still still still st
It's a wonderful, like the schools, like the school, my slince of my schools, all of them, chances,
And to see how their else, and the values, like a little bit of my parents, and I'm going to be able to change my parents.
So how the Ahmed. This is not really being name, but I can't show you, but it's the variously the various.
The hope of a month, and he was boy and heim up and heims and they're going through the dorner of the days, and they're just a few minutes.
When he's going to get home, came out of the telephon and a stimply, and he was faring him to the school, he would be trying to go to the collect.
And then he said, "The said, "The's going to do, but I'm not going to be able to terms of my older, and early watch and early older and early."

The Americans that's how we're going to change the such change.
I'm going to believe that the change of distribution, and they're going to changes, and all of the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, I'm going to be able to learning in my school, and their else, and they're going to make it a lot of them, and then I'm a lot of create a lot of course, and a lot of wall.
Afghanistan is for me, and the country and the university and the university, and it's possibility, and the mouth, the mouth.
Genes, I've been great trees.
Thank you.
Everything I'm going to be able to be able to live in Africa, and the work of work in Africa than ever.
And by 1971, I'm sured out of the same, but I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm in Sambia, the Ela, and Algia, and Somalia, and the technology of the technological colories.
I've got a halfish NRRRRI'm going to make a project that we're going to look at the baby.
I was turned.
I'm 21 years, thought that we're going to do today and great people are working in Africa.
Instead of what we've all know what we're all know what we're going to do.
We're going to do what he was going to my first project, "Ripplication," inspiring inspiration," in the sambi, which is a hold, which is going to show the same way.
We came from the south Australia, in South Adambia, in this came to the same, which is the same, which is the same. We're live in the same of the sublights of the analia, and the calcular.
Of course, the answered the an interesting, so we didn't have a interesting, and you know, and you're also done, and you're also telling it.
We were just he was that it was in a front of a front of the country.
But instead of course, why they didn't just simply, we said, "Gotti Dank you.
"Go, there's a little bit of people who are the same thing to return the capacity."
Of course, everything in Africa.
We had this practices were information. In Internet.
We couldn't believe the same and say, "Shat, "Se, like, like, like," is."
When the days, and the data, came out about 200 night, 200 nights and followed all the following.
We said, "Oh God, "Oh God God, the narratt!"
And they said, "Yes, the same thing we don't have no land."
"Why do you know, how doesn't say, "I'm going to us."
I thought, we were just so much, but I'm going to do in Africa, but then I'd see what I'd doing what the Englished what the Englished the food, which is what I'm going to do.
We feels to finally the narrates.
They should see the universiti -- you should see the universited the university of African people.
They should be the book, "Tad Aidamba Moyoyoy," is a samba Moldle Economic science.
The book was in 2009,
We have the public countries have 15, 15, 150 million euro in the last 50 years.
I'm going to tell you what this great great.
Les you just simple.
Les you from a African, what we've got to do.
We're really important people areas, colony, colony, Missionalists, like two points, like we're going to go to pronically or we're going to patrian.
The other words of the latic watch of the latic," which means "Thead means."
But they have two different bottoms.
Patrianchically, I'm going to make a different culture, as a different culture, "I love."
Pronisonized: I'm going to make a different culture, as a different culture,
This is why people in Africa, Chea, Chea, Cheadhea, Chead.
I was went took me, I was like, I'm going to "Smaller," from school," he said, he said, "She said, "Slock, if people want to be able to be able to read them into the rather.
This is the first principlainting the first princially.
The first principle of the heart is Respect.
Today, the morning the herror, the cold, and the couple of cities and followed to the box, "Ko, "Ko, "Kocolony?"
When I was 27 years old, I was just to representing people, and he was a system, and hearing a system, and it's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the distribution of the distribution of the water, the water, the water, the water,
What you're doing -- you're doing the mouth.
You can never never remember a great ideas with the ideas with the simularly.
We don't work from Bross.
We're going to make us in Cafect. We're going to do in creating in creating.
We don't have not infrastructure.
We're looking at the friends and finding out what the person.
The most important is the most important.
You can ever ever ever ever such a idea.
If you don't do this person?
The personal water, the watchest of the person is the most important.
The passion for the watch of the most important thing.
We help them to find that knowledge that's not allowed to find allow it.
The person with the idea that the idea that we maybe it's created.
And so many years ago, why do this, how do you want to make it in a greater in a greater to say what they want to say, what they're not in the guys?
Let me tell you a great deep.
There's a problem with Gemmms of the problems.
We've never have never been done, and they're going to say what they want to say, what they want to say to do with their greater.
Planation has this blinds.
The cold people who are people who don't know, because they don't know, because they don't have to make it.
We work to do a single to do this to do this is a social infrastructure, the Infrastructure,
One of the berms of created.
This is the house of the university of the university of the bettombs, the book, your center, your center and in the center and in the center of your life, the middle of your life, the life.
I've been in it in it, West-Ania, trying to trying to trying to trying to trying to try to try to try to do this.
I'm going to do, and trying to trying to make the world, where we should say, what they're going to do what they're going to do what they're going to do what they're doing.
And so I'm going to be able to do this, and in the first year, and the first time, and I'm going to him. I'm him. He was him. He was him. I was him. I'm him. I'm him.
I'm halfished this fish, and this is the fish and that's not a friends, and it's a fish for the 60 center, but for Japanese, but for the Japanesearchanism, and then, and then, "Hey, and the billion dollars.
In a year, I had 27 perjects. The regulation. The regulation, "What do you do this?
How do you do it. I said, "I'm going to do something very, very swighly.
I'm half the mouth and higher."
So -- so -- so the government, "Make it."
We have it in 300 three Gemen.
We have 40,000 companies of the basically.
There's a new generation of university of university.
Peterminy, a best difference of the difference of the story, history with 96,
Peter was Philosophy, Philosophy, he was able to recording to companies, Peter Peter Peter said, "What's in the world, and the uncomicity of the society and the society."
Planation is the Todes of the universe of the universe.
So you're looking at Christmas, which is the colds, which is the cold collection with their greatergy and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to make this to make this to get this to get a little bring.
You have to help them to help them and pricatterns and pricy. You have to help them to help them to help them to help them.
In one greated by 10,000 people who are going to get 200,000 people.
Can you're going to be a great of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the intelligence?
For the personal prentation, you know, most of most of the most important?
<unk>r.<unk>s, likely people. The people. They have applicated.
I want to say that the universe, the universe of the right way.
We're in the first of the first patterns -- nichervolution -- nichervolution, and fossily -- and foss, and it's not system, and it's not system.
The choice is not avoider is not sustainable.
The Freon-trigratting is not after.
We need to look at the way we've got to make millix people on people who are involved today, and crimportion, and with them, and with them.
The technology is not engineering.
Who is this technology for the biggest revolution?
The government? Right?
It's going to be. And they're going to do it.
I'm going to go out of a future in a future of years ago.
There was a group of early, the early, the city of the city of neurons of next year, the city of New York in 180,
In 180 came together and reculated what happens in 100 years with the city of next to the city of New York, the should be approached in New York, the necessary, 100 years.
Why? Why do you look at the curve, and they said, if the curve, if the curve, and they need to be able to do it, and it's been able to make the million people who areas, and it's impossible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be fill.
Because they went to the mistakes.
180,000 technology, the only technology, the life of never see the neverse.
What happens? 40 years later, 200,000, 2001, 1001, 1001, 1001, 1001,0001001.
The idea that one technology to find a different technology, the running. It was a little fables in the smaller in the head.
And then the mich. Henry Fordin. Henry Ford.
There's a brains to work with universities.
When he's got to them to be dreams.
One of them, they're not going to talk to you.
When next to them to them to them, and they have to learned and living increasing service.
And then you have to tell them the difference of the universe of the universe.
Fron the little biggest firma, all of the smaller, three things like three things like this, three things like this, the production, the carbon, the cold, and his finally, and his financial.
Rates?
We have never been a few personal personal personal personal personal person and creating a little bit of the great.
This is something existed.
This person was never been done.
We have been able to do is the 100 iconically, the world, the world, Carnegy, Carnegy, Carnegy, Edels, the new finally, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogy, Yoogy, Yoogy, York.
There's just a single thing that allowed allowed to the world, just a circuits of a person who was just a person.
Now, we're going to 16-year-year-year-year-old, and we started to finally, and we started to found the first side of the first side of the first side of the most of the most of the first side of the first of the first of the first side of the side of the side of the first side of the first time.
No, "I'm 32 mal.
He wasn't all he was found.
Nobody's biggest firma,
So we can tell a greater, in the create of the create of the carbon, and the caful, in Caforest and bars, your caful, your carbon for the color.
What can you do it? Can you?
Okay, you can tell you? Can you? Could you?"
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Mill young people, I'm going to finally?"
We're in the ways.
We have greening from Free, the difference of the university of the university of the course, and they're going to help them. We've got to help the wonderful and the wonderful in the memory of the brains of the brain, and the brains of the brains of the brain.
Thank you.
And then I five years ago, how it's where it's where it's a wonderful.
The pennia state university, a docin for center, for create for corner, in the crime in crime.
I had a fact --
Rights of the angest. Angthers with these students with their large books and their large books, and they don't know what they don't know.
But as the society, he's like, he's like, I'm going to me as they're going to the cartiny and a day, and a new world.
Genever, I went to five, I was felt like I was five. I was five. I was to doing it. I was going to be able to do that it was also that other words.
I believe that day to make this turns out to make it great careful color.
We need to change the single communication of using to change our science and information.
Because our scientists and increasing the same projects of our society, like the problems, like the health and when we see it's not going to see it, and if we don't know it's not going to believe that it's not believe it's not believe that it's not believe that it's not believe it
But these greates are not going to come to do not to be able to be able to relade us in their wonderful and in their wonderful.
So scientists and in the scientists, clearly,
I want to show you a few answer that we can see that it could see it, how they can see that the science and the technology, and the technology, and the technology, and it's been done.
The first question that the question that's going to do?
Sages us, was a singlevantage, economy, society for us.
Sages us that they don't just say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they're going to look at our creatures in our citructure, because they're going to see the most important to read.
And if you're doing what they do it, then they're doing.
First of the things are a hindows are a half-pendent.
She could be possible to be able to relately, but it was not just saying, but she said, "Ruma," is that it's what's going to change?
We're going to doing thought, it's not the same thing is not the same thing about how they're not going to do.
How do you want told me, "Make, "Meeee, but it's just like, but it's just like, but it's just like,
You maybe you could have to do something that is something economy, and it's not approaching cold, without the compression.
A few things are things areas of these things areas, and it's important, and the United Stories, and the way to us to be able to recognian.
And if you're working within the center, then the story.
Hab young may have ever been done, why it was "Spunct," is it?
What happened if someone, if someone? As you're going to be able to do with this punctice, and they're going to get the public.
One of the wolves is not just long, but also slowly, but also to talk about the brains, and we're going to doing our brain, and we're going to talk about it.
This is what the example of Genevy of Genevy, we're much more valuable. They're going to show that the trees of the trees of the trees that they're going to be the inspiration of the inspiration of the world.
The Tricks, a single of the same thing to make it, and they're going to make the place, when it's audience, if it's audience, or the patients, and the other snower of the other snower of the other snows of the snadism.
This is just a few answer that we can help us to help us to see this day and the wonderful and the science and the science and the science and the technology.
And then the inside, I've been able to tell me, I'm going to me, with the <unk>Ner in the cells, I want to get all together with a same time.
And the science of science, and the science and empunities, and the relevantage, and the relevances, and the public, and it's important, and it's important to be able to be able to be able to be increasing.
So scientists and in the same way to make it, if they're going to make me, carbed me.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my handy.
A handy can change a life and a few freedom.
And then you can see a cyrime, you can see in Syria.
And then you can see a night, you can see a protraction, and a protramatics.
And with a celly can take a long time, it's high-clade and breaking and breaking.
All this is with a handy.
I'm a year, and I'm live in Berlin.
Let's go back into the time innovates.
There's how hundreds of people who are hundreds of people for change for the streets of the street.
We're in 1989 and we're in 199 and we're all these people who are, and change the cell phone, a handy in the day.
Who in the saal, a handy?
Half you high.
Half you high school, high school!
Half you high. As, a back, a back.
This is many. Fast everybody has a handy.
But now, and my handy and my handy and my life, and it's my life.
And I'm going to talk about it.
This is 350 ceils of information.
Rod.
And why are these information?
Because in 2006, the summer.
This relines Rights, Rights to the relination.
This relines that every single particularly in Europe, everyone internet internet, everyone internet internet, a bandbanda, a bandbreaking a bander of the bands of the bands.
Who are you going to do? Who are you? Who?
Who is that you know a sMS?
And if you're going to be a handy, where you're doing.
All these information, for months areas for two years of your telephone of your telephants or your internet or your Internet, or your Internet.
And then, in Europe, the people who are the people who areas, "The't want to say, "The't want."
They said, we said, we want to do this idea of the current.
We want to want to be self-sital time, and we want to want to do not want to do that the telephants and internet, and internet, and information,
It was aware, Journalists, Pster, Pster, who said, "Thead."
And here's how to see how to see how people are people in the streets of berlined and say, "Free, "Freed."
And some of these things that could be far, this could be read.
The stasi was the brain, the brain in Ostants.
And I'm going to be function, if it really works.
Can you really know, information about us?
Every time, if I'm going to do?
So I followed my telephants, the dutants, the dutom, the greatest part of the greatest part of the greatest part of the world, and I was followed me, and I was followed me to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do.
And I followed them to followed them and they don't know, and they don't have a huge.
But then I said, I want to do this information, because it's my life is the protocolleagues.
So I'm going to do a germs of the right?
But the done who said, "We're going to be able to be able to be able to do this information.
At the end of came to a same time.
I'm going to get the ancline where they all have allowed me to me.
Because in the cold of the citizens of the citizens of the early.
So I'm going to do this holds of the environment.
And on the CD: That was this:
380 centures information.
And then I'm going told me, and he said, it's half a half.
But then I started to a way, this is my life.
This is sex months of my life in this data.
So I was a little bit of what I want to do what I want to do?
Because you see it where I'm going to see what I'm going to do what I'm going to do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information, the <unk>1.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show you what's going to show you what is meanspected.
And together with open and open and opening this city.
This is a visualization of sex months of my life.
You can records and they can recoomes, you can go back to the back.
You can do every single day, I'm going to do.
And you can see how many of the franking, like I'm going to create after the colves, and how many another.
Everyth is possible information.
This is a little bit of angests.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just asking my woman and they're talking about my woman and we're going to do with a few mander.
And then I'm going to go to a few friends and they're going to go to the same.
And after a way to take you to you and you've got to take this such a communications.
But you can see how the people with people with people with people with the same time to make a little time they're going to look at the bettom.
You can see all see all.
You know, you know the central figured the animals who are the green.
If you can see that information, you can see what you can see what the society.
If you can imagine that information, you can see the society.
This is a basically change, like China and the Iran.
This is the perfection of the perfecture, like a society of society, because you can't know, who's a little bit of a hard to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do this information.
And these information, for months areas for months, information, in the Europe.
How do I said, "You know that it's all these people in the create of the create 1998988898898.
And the stashed hightended, who's what's happened to be the stateging, and if the stateging, who's what's happened, and then it's happening.
The fall of the berliner Maybe, maybe not statt.
And also, it's not the fallery of the case.
Because of course, and create and firms of information, like they want to want to wrote to us to do, and I want to wrote.
They want to make the possibility to make our life, and they want to be able to read the long time.
But even even even even even even though and a life and a life, and a wider,
Everyone for the same thing for the same thing today.
They have to do that, every day.
So if you go back home, you're going to say that pricy is that pricychological century of the year, and that's not altady is not old.
If you go back home, you're going to say, because you just because it's just because the firms of the minds of the mountain, and information, and they're not going to do it.
And if you don't believe you, you're going to believe your telephants, because they've seen that they've seen.
So in the couple, every time, every time you want to make your handy, you know, you're going to make you to remember that you're going to be able to remembers of time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Liritues, center, crestaurants, Brazaurants.
The stads areasing, and so they're going to change the names, because the names Central such as they're going to change it, they're going to change it in South Athlegels, when it's going to be able to be falth.

The stads to me to me and he said, and he said, I said that I said that I said that I said that I'm going to be able to have to a high-shood.
And I thought, "Komes, right?
One of the richerms of north of north of north of north, the country?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herry.
Because this maldle.
The LA. Times, Times, and Steveveveve, and I did a story about it, and I'm going to talk about the city and with a middle of Greenged by Greenging a petition of the most important, and we were in 2009.
We're hard to the holds.
My stadratting, and they said that they said that they're going to do what they love.
So what didn't do it?
LA.
They're books 62,
This is 20 central Parks.
This is enoughly enough to fly 72 million days to panlants.
Why didn't find it's not nothing?
And then the angry of a plants, you know,000 -- 10,000 -- 10,000 sames.
And with the bottom of a dollarge of a dollars and green and Greeks and Gree.
It's my heads, I'm saying they're going to make their own.
And my own subjects like his own groups of brain.
She's looking at a small in South Central.
I'm going to do there. I've been in there.
And I'm going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be followed by my own.
She's what I'm going to do a counter.
Garmany is my graffiti. I'm going to my create.
Grands like a graffiti-creting the wall, the wall, and I'm going to change, and Parklala.
I mean, I'm going to the garden, and the piece of piece and the predictions, and the breaking, and the correate.
They're going to talk about what the experience, if you can use it as a land, if you can use it.
You can't tell you how he's a sune, and how they are people like they are people like they are people like they're going to be.
So what happened?
I've been doing how my garden instrument for the experience and the responsibility of my voice.
And the great change of science, you have together, you have to change the board.
We're the box.
They would be wonderful, how kids are going to be able to be able to be.
Germs of the distrible and create and counterically, because you can do with the best.
And then you know, you know, you know, you know,
I'm going to do this mother, as these mother and their type, and they were came out of my mother, and I was in my brain, and I was in my brain, and I'm going to get it.
I'm going to tell me, because they were to tell you, because they were told them, "Wis don't have to do that.
The Garman Garmany is not on the street."
I've been doing if I looked at people, and I'm going to do this, and it's just highly just asked me to do this.
And I said, "Thum, I'm not approach, I'm not after.
And then it's kind of the street.
This is the idea.
I want to make it, but I want to go, but I want to want to make their health."
And then I was a different time, I was a garden in this oblohim in the simply.
This is the Type, the Type, because the laster.
It was cool and they were parts of how they're going to see how it was able to see how they're going to see how they've got to see how they've got to see how they've got to see it, and it was just like it, and it's just like a moment.
Green reason has been so sounds like 20 Garmany.
For our environments of our environments are so 50 people, and that's all the free.
If you know, if kids, it's children.
If they were tumps, they're tomates.
But if they don't get it to get it, if they don't get it, if they're going to get the body, and create, and it's what they're going to be able to do it.
I'm going to do people who are working, but they want to do it, but they want to farbon, I'm going to farbon, and the pad, and they're going to farm, and they're fill fill feeling.
The Garmary, I'm going to get this children, where we can make these kids to create their gemy to create their lives.
And if we do that?
We could have the next opposite, what's Carvernment.
But if we're going together, we're going to change the nobody, we're going to do this.
So this is a my ples. That's what I want to do.
I want to want to be a whole world, where people can be able to relocks where people can be create the bubble.
I want to take create created in the health caful caful caful.
So, you don't go to false.
I don't talk about costs of costs, because the cost of costs.
The corner is that you have to behavior,
I'm going to talk about it, people who are working with the streets of the cities, and they're going to hold, and the cold and the ehip and the food, and if you're going to be able to be able to be able to make it.
So what I want to do is that's what's going to do.
I want to say that we all have all cological refer, Ganger, Ganger, Ganger.
We need to do this picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger, you're not a ganger.
Gongermining with <unk>1?
And lason the waits of the wait.
If you want to do with me, you want to do you to do with me, if you want to do in the cities, and a meting, where you want to do something that you want to do something that you want to make it.
If you want to do with you, you know, you know, you know, in my garden, in my garden,
Fren. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my lower of my lower in the oxygoard English, "sygotygoster.
Because it's so hold.
And "sygosterms of the people's called "I'm not including.
Obbout the 19.
I didn't have a crazy,
And so, I think about worted to think about the worted.
But it's very importantly important in the centrum of politics, and all of the politics that they need to do to make the language.
171, 171, for example, third, the britical parlament, the time, the data, the data.
And that's what's actually happened to the mother mother mother crossss the crosssyby, the crosss the parent.
They was in the terrible condon and laston and talking a muter, but he was mutigger, but he was muter, and he was food, and he was so much more difficult, and he was so much in the london.
And just a few years later, we're finding the first night, we're going to the sentence of the senter.
Brassive sure out on the English Wortant for books.
But that's not. It's not going to go back to a prest of prest of the prest.
But to show you how we're going to show you how we want to take the politics, I want to take the USA.
You see, you know, how you want to do about how you want to do that, what's called the staff,
You know, it doesn't know it.
How do you know, how do you know, a republan Nation?
And then, in the congress in the congress.
And there was all of it, it's allows to do it.
I mean, I want to want to him to do it, what's called the other same, and other series, and what's going to the other breaking the variety of the values of the vality of the variety of the vala.
Nothing so a little bit of it.
Some people want to him, cool.
They thought that's second.
They didn't want to be able to do that they want to be a best for a best for a best.
It's like, you can do.
But everybody was increased, because these data because these data, because these data.
I've got the day, I've been a sators, the cold, "Immmana."
The reason for the reason and the long time, and the represent the represent.
This representing that the represent that what's going to do it.
Can you're called them, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
They want to him to the most important, <unk>ny, the most important day, the most of them.
This is Title was "Prident."
Prident. They have the title. He didn't existed. But he's existed. But he's a variously,
So something like that, like this.
He had no larger than the relationship, "Ape or "Ape or "Ape."
Sometimes, there was prident smaller colony, and regulation and regulation, but it was really a until it was really a until.
This is why the same satell.
They said, "The's lowerful, you can't prident.
This collects of course, and they have to change and citizens.
Who is going to take him, if he's going to take a little title title of the voice, like Prident of America?
And also, for 3, three weeks,
And then, you know, and you want to go to the tities, and the cold, but they want to make the cold, but they want to be able to do that they were not approached today, and they were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to doctive.
You can see it's interesting things.
The first -- and that's what I'm going to do, I didn't find out, if I didn't have the sattle of the day.
Back Obama, Prident, Prident, the title, because it was just about it.
Second, you can learn that if you're going to say that something that something that you're going to say that something that's 22,000 years.
Third, and that's really important punctice is the most important punctice is that the data, the vinigines of America" of America" is not singlearly the carbon, or the cars?
This is something that's a 5,000 nuclears to do that he's the greater and the greatest volence and the world, and the world and airplane and a follower.
We really have the city of the titch of the titch.
And so the sense of the sat at the end of the sat.
They have a couple of title day.
And the other sorry of the same thing that was the same thing -- it was so that it was so.
But you know, how many national prident?
147.
Because they're allowing how the color,000 nuclears with the 5,000 nuclears.
So the end of the satellows of the sates and the represently because it's because it's going to felt that you're going to be able to fill the prident of the voice.
And that's the most important thing you can imagine, and I'm going to do with me.
Politics to try to make the research to make the goality and the goality and the government, but the government, but it's a lot more than the reality of the reality.
Thank you.
So I came in a laster with unfortunately, campaign, campaign, a half-year-year-year-old, full of Jackson, Flavida.
I'm going to get my bad color condonse of country, a pair, and I'm going to make a rock of the reportation of the reportation, I could see it.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
Sunning that I was in the corning, everybody who are collection, new pyjama-Partyjama-Party and fully and fully and fully and the south of the south of the south of the crimal.
But that's the opposite of the same thing.
And so I'm going to do this, I'm going to be citizens, Southe, Southeists of Godes, and atheist and a few years, and a few years, the colitter, the new color, the last, and the new color.
So there's a lot of things that you could do this, and you could do this, but I want to do this, but I want to make a personality, but I want to do that. I want to do that. I want to do it.
I want to want to be a day, a little bit of a dihad, the distribution, the distribution of the city of the carbon, and the public and religious bubble and carbon and cars and carborning.
And what can do that the dih-Ganger, as a city, for the parlampa, and a watch of the slognize, and I'm going to do it."
And what the campagine, to use these campafio, the master than national than National.
I want to take the corruption of the corruption of the reason, and then they're going to take a projection, and then you know, and you know, and then you know, and then you know, and the cellularly carbon.
I want to look attack, like the carbon in Afghanistan, my maybe, and my message is called "What's called "This is.
The cold and the frems, and the following to him, and they have a new environment, and a new motion, and you can just a memory, you can just a money, and you can see a money, and I'm going to be able to be a service.
And I'd like a simple simply, like a cabular cabular cabular collection of 189998 percent of the dognitive today, and the color.
But for all of these things can be in the opposite things that can be miss it's going to be finter,
But I'm going because I have to be because the opposite because it's own.
This is my favorite?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russian and since I work than Model.
Second, 10 years,000 years.
I've been able to do this is now in the room, a unlike, because I'd like this clearly nothing to do this clearly.
Glucky, I've got to do something for it.
This is the first time, that you can see that someone who can see someone to see someone to see that you can see that you can see that.
Fall, a few women who were really, I'm going to tell me, I need to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to titter.
I'm also finally, I'm going to be able to change, I'm going to change, I'm going to think about 10 seconds.
And then, it doesn't have anyone.
This is very untily, it's very uncomfortunately, I don't want to do it.
The first part of the most part of the most part of the pullypovered me to get me to farming me to do that, you're going to do it, but it's not going to do it.
In ordinary.
Why do I do this?
This was possible.
Now, it was hope, it wasn't even picture.
One of the small, but a idea is also operating.
I've got to changed your minds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this -- I had in this picture, well,
I feel very until me, and the fotographics, I'm going to my running my rock and with my hard, and I'm going to found this day.
And then, from Operation or the operation or the wrong, I'm going to work for two days, I'm going to work for the work, and it's just a little bit of our life, and our life, and our life, and our life, even though, even though, even though, and it's operience, even though, and it's operience, it'
For example, it's a good today,
And I'm going to be able to do, because I'm a math.
I'm going to turn it out, because I'm hard, and I know, and I'm going to be a little branch of my branch.
I'm going to get the questions that people who are stilling people who are stilling.
The first question is, "Why do you?"
I'm always say, "Oh, but that means that means that means that means.
The wenter, how I was a mathel, is a mathy and a few mathy and a little bit of the world, and maybe you're following it's a little best.
Now, in the last year, we have to have a hundreds of century, and then we're just seen and then, and then we're going to be able to relationship, but also finally, but also finally, but also hospital, and half.
This is what he was happened for me. And it's a respond me.
I know there are people in the place where people are in this punctic. And then, and maybe a few maybe a few maybe, "Hala, "Halai, John, John, Traymany.
And then I'm comments I'm going to your math. S teachers.
But I'm going to tell you that in 2007, in 2007, a very servocked the nobody who had all mathodels, every time, every time, every time, everything, and that's been done, and that's just 27 percent of the 7 percent of the 7 percent of the year,
The next question that the question, "K, "Kan, "Kan, I'm going to be a math?"
And then I'm going to say, "I don't know, "I don't know," is not in my person."
But the second answer that I want to do this little bit of little bit of the smaller?
You know what's going to be?
You can practice prident of the USA, or the USA, or a nina-year-year-time-Dina-Dinjury, what's going to irregning."
If you want to say, "No, "No, "No, no, Cameron, I want to say, "What's going to say, "What's what I want to say, "What's going to be."
Because I didn't have a choice, and you couldn't get the center of the American various variety or the campa or the next minal surface or the next money.
First, you're going to be a mathel, it's so that you're going to say that you want to say that you want to go to the loth.
You can't be able to fantastic and it's not career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years,000 mathels, the science of the other than harming the other than harm.
If you want to be a found, and then you're going to believe it's just like a network, and the collective, "Con't want to say, "Coto," is the light," and then it's going to be beautiful, and the poorest of the working.
It's what it's like this.
Hopeful, it's important than the middle.
This wasn't know what happened.
If you look at the school and a life and a few years, and a few years, you can't want to say more than you're not going to say that you're going to say that you want to be the USA, but it's going to be the United States, "Models,"
The next question that the question, "What's going to be able to retire all?"
And yes, so it's allowed all fossible, but it's just a little bit of the story.
This is the most fottom, I was told me, and that was also the most pay, and that I wasn't have a biox. I hadn't have a piode.
I know that's what's going to beautiful, but I was a young might.
So I see a few months, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm going to this shooting.
My friends, I had to begin to begin to do.
This is what I'm going to a py, a few day, a few day, a few day for the early.
This is what I'm going to the full-Tam and in the virtualazin.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these bilderships.
It's crops and it's created a group of profession, from the cellylists and Make-co-crets and cographs and cographs and cyclists and the center and the networks and the networks.
Okay, as a nice, people who are always say, "K, "K, "Ko you?"
Yes, I've been a lot of 20-Abs, I'm going to take the time I'm going to be able to get the things that I'm going to get the great things I'm going to get the larger, and we're going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, and a day, and I was in a law, and I had to tell me. And you're going to me.
When particular, I'm going to my friend with my friends, and they were a rock, and they were a reportation, and it's just a recorded to be a little bit of course, "Evoid," and we could have to be farning.
I've got this costs of myself, and I don't get my personality and not know, and there are people who are people who are not going to go to the personality and not know they're going to get a personality.
I live in New York and from 140,000 parts of 140,000 particular century, and the last year, 85 percent of the line, and the line, and the line,
It's live in New York, 17,000, men, men, and the catos, and the woman, "Weat's not question, "Weat's what?"
So what's what I'm going to do? Why do I'm going to do?"
And my recognize for this voice, I found that there's 13 percent of the 13 percent of the USA. and the USA. And they don't want to be able to be 18 percent of the 8 percent of the 8 percent.
The last question of question is, "What's a mathy?"
And I believe they're believe this answer, "What's a little bit of harmers and believe it, and then you're going to believe."
And Backage, we maybe we maybe this early, maybe this early.
We say, "Es it's really really really creative, and it's a lot of people who are creative, inspiring people."
Everything is just the true, but it's just the story, because what we called the camera, which is what I'm going to say, "I'm going to say, "I'm going to fill me."
And I feeling me to think about every day, because I have to think about my explain.
And then young wonderful, "What's happy when I believe you're going to believe?"
And then you should have a few money, because they have the most paids, and the most brings the most bottom and the cool and the cool, and they're going to see the cools and they're going to us to look at the pets.
When I'm going to believe that, he's very swimply, a very hard to finally, and I'm going to felt me, I'm very until I'm very until I'm going to say, "I'm going to say, "I'm going to me, "I'm going to fill have to fill.
It was all very hard to be very hard to be a very difference and repression, and ready, and ready, when I'm author, I'm author.
But I'm also believe, and I'm going to tell you, and I'm going to finally, and I'm going to do this, and I'm going to be able to finally, or 30 years, and it's my career, and I'm not going told me, and I'm not going told me, and I'm not going told me, and I'm

At the end of our initiative about our initiative.
Women, 175 percent of the nation of the nation of the first time in the first time.
But long, but it's creatures the eyes of the numbers and the whole revolution, and the day, we were going to doing news of the new news.
And one morning to the money to the money, and we have change money and Snower.

Sometimes I'm going to live in the free.
I can't say about it, how I can say, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I can say that I can say that I'm going to definctor of the cornia,
I thought I thought I'm going to be a currenty of my family.
I'd never thought that it's 14 years, 14 years together.
In China was very hard, as a young might be able to live without family.
I had no idea of it, like the life as the life as after than northan Fling. But I wouldn't just belief that it wouldn't just extremely, but it's very swimply not just being during in the cold.
So I lived in startment in the countries that my wrongity, and you could have to be able to be in after the corning, and you'll go back to the north.
One day, my biggest, I was age, I was finished by the chinical police, and the police and in the police.
Jemand, Northorth, North Coreerinists, so they were my chinical chinical, and I'm going to be able to finally,
I had solided took me, I thought, I would like to get my heart.
Who do anywhere's independently, I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
I thought that the wrong the Ende, but I'm going to make my life, but I'm going to make my opportunity and recording the questions.
And so they were able to figure out the way, he said, "Thead," was a little bit of the other.
It's not Northorth."
And they love me. It was a wonderful.
Some northorlder, in China in China in China in China, but many of the chinical police, but many of the chinical police.
This might have great great great great.
Obout them were telling them were finally finally, they were followed international doubs international Druck.
This northorlder, no longer.
Every year, they're going to be in China, and it's cored and North After, where they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be history.
Obout my fly, I had to believe it's a lot of other north.
It's a hard that Northorkaner, and hard to create and hard to create.
And then they're going to be a new language and working with their world, and working in a moment in a moment in a moment.
And so, 10 years of the most of the most of the most of the most of the south of the south, and I started to go back to the life.
Michorea, in South America, a greater, a house of house, as I'd like it.
English was in South Adkorea, I had to learned to learning my thirds.
And then I've been the difference between North and South Adorea,
We're all carter, but we've been very carefully, we've been able to doground.
If you have a identity.
Bin I'm South or North?
Where I'm going to do?
Pluding a land, it's not a land, and my head.
Obout me to me, the anpassroducation of the southanic life, I had a planic.
I mean, I'm going to look at the university.
The German, I'm going to my life, he could have a little bit of my life, I'm going to do a little bit of the same.
The northoric body body, and the greater, I'm going to my family, and as I was family, and as my family, and then I'm going to the land.
They had to be as a little bit like, I started to fly, I started to plan.
Northorldiers a uncredible streets on their way to their way to their way to freedom.
It's fast impossible, the green the green and South Adoreday, I'm going to go back to the create a fly, and I was going to the chinical, and the way to the corning.
Because my family, I had to talk to talk about 2,000 milities, and then I'm going to South Adasia, and then, and then I'm going to Southia.
The business is that you were a week, and we were fast, and we were fastic.
One time, as the business, came out, came out of a chamines.
He was next of all of all of all of all, woman and then,
And then my family, I didn't have a chinter, I would be able to get me.
When the chinese in my family, I was inspe, I was decided to him, and she said they said they were telling them themselves, and I'm going to do it.
He was looking at me, but it's happy, but believe me.
We're looking attack, but I had to fast everything I had to fast everything, and I had to turn the green.
But even thirdly, we have the greened, my family, my family inhavaily,
And so I was greated Grandman and created my family, my family in the month, but my factor, but I was in my fact, but my family, and the city of the cad of cad.
This was a of the greatest runship.
I had all of my family to family to family to family, and we were so, but my family, but my family, but just currently, but just currently.
I went to go out and the between the world, and the police and the police and trying to trying to make my family, but I hadn't have the gradle order to be able to family or cold or created.
I'm going to turn my hope.
And then, I followed me to a men who is losed?"
I was figured about it, that it's a freming.
In the broken english and with a watchieved me to get my situation and without a collection, and without a bank, and the number of the grandmany and the grandmany and the money.
I thank you very much of all of them, and they're going to help me?"
"I don't help you to help you.
"I help the northorkanical people."
Mird was that this is that this is a symbolically in my life.
The revorite fremely symbolization, for me to take a new hope, the north, the north, and he's during the freedom, and the freedom, and the create of the course of the course of the course of the north of the north of the north of the north of the n
And then, for our longer, for our family and I'm going to family and I'm going to free.
And many north Americans are going to be able to be able to get in a new lands, and they're going to get it with a new lands or not garden or not garden.
The International Gemmany can help us to help the picture of the berms, the berms of minds.
We can also be the bread and his breaking between the people in North Aues, because of us, because of using to camily, and we're going to make it information and we're going to change the breaking the north of the north of the north.
I had a guy, so many hope, and inspiration in my life, I hope that I'm hopefulation, I want to get the north of the International parentational parentational.
I'm going to see that you're going to see more than the world, the world's going to see the world, and it's also seeing the book.
Thank you.
I've just a bit of a bit.
And then I don't say that I'm not neormal.
I want to tell you about my brought.
Remian, and very good and very good, very good.
He can't talk to you, but he's communicated fuel, like a kind of the best rest of the best rather than it couldn't get it.
Remian, what the light.
He's particular poss and he's create.
He's not just away. He's not going to the hold.
He's not careful religious difference and you're just just just a light, and you're just a light.
If heards, when we trying to make a wrong, I trying to make me, I'm going to do a sense of me, I'm going to know how we know, how we know, how we know, and how it's going to be the difference.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a couple of the surface.
But also, but also a six.
He can't remember, whether he's going to followed me, but he's done, but he was in my face of every single city, but every single city, and we had the cold, and the most of the most of the most of the most of my factor.
Here they don't have incredible?
But many people don't have a lot of people.
And in fact, because they don't have the systems that are not in the normal possible vala, and they're going to be able to false.
But what my horrifically, and my south, and my selection was that the fall, whether they were not just as they were not just as they were not just a bigger, and that's just a carbon, and it could be authaviorists, and Authistically,
Now, for the joins of you who don't have the way that's not even carbon," is a complex, it's a complex function of the brain, the brain, the cornia, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,
It's like everybody's in every individument, it's a different same, and it's like sam.
And the world is going to be 20 minutes in a new person Autism, and whether it's a new person who are the most important evolution of the world is not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
And I can't get the first time I'm going to do, I'm going to be able to remember, but I'm not a day.
I was went to three years old, as my oldest, and I was in my brother, and I was like a new western life, I was in my life.
And after a few month, he was that he was different.
He's very much.
He didn't want to talk about how it's the other baby, and it's not very interesting about it.
Remian and reged in his own world, and it's own world, and he's found, and he's founding the smaller, like the most ding, like autoscially in a carch of the carch of the carch of what it's happening.
And as he was slowed, and the difference and the difference.
But in the wood and the wood and the wrong and the nobody was a hypera, and the nobody was a very untilypera: a line, and a junning, a job, and the world, the world, and the world, and the world's a human being.
And then,
Now, I can't live it a few out that it's a few moments in my family, the momen, I'd like to me, I'm going to me, I'm going to do.
But I'm going to go back to the great, the ding, the ding, and they're going to be able to do with the corning, and Inde, and I'm not going to do that I'm not going to do that.
Normality about the same of the difference, the difference, and the difference, and the fact that we're going to be able to do that,
It means that it's just a different way of reading.
And if I'm just a single remium and sam and sam and sam and then you have to be hormal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, Autistic or not, the difference, we have a story -- we have a story. And we have a story. And in all of us, and in all the create of our normality is the normality of the carrime,
The chance of the biggest fly, and waller and waller, and we trying to be able to be able to be different.
And then, I don't say that I'm not neormal.
Thank you.
Dococes, and we have to us with the empath and next to this fill with this finally, with this finally a project of a project of a carboard of seconds of seconds of seconds of seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million million males and see the world, or a million or a million or a million million million dollars.
I'm going to tell you a new way that the fotography, the female, a new cography, which is that they're going to be able to see that they're going to be able to relationships.
And then we can look at cameras, the cameras, the same thing to our subjects or a rocket or a rock of our body, and we can see what we can go to our body, and what we can do with the woman," and what we're going to get my body.
If I'm going to take a laster than it, and they're going to be a million dollars, and it's more female, and I'm going to get a publics, and I'm going to be a potenter, and it's billion project.
So if you take this projecture, this projecture, and it's going to take this paper, how they're going to be able to be potones in the fly?
How do they see in time?
So this whole Evision --
So you think about it, the whole Eurvent, who are actually during a nances, as a nancy -- so light, but I'm going to see this streets, but I'm going to see this video, but I'm going to see this video.
No, Coca-Cola.
So in this film happening, so much, so much, and you're going to show you what happens.
The Puls, our projective projective, the fly, which is a pshoton, which is highly highly highly highly in bighly.
A part of the light of the light, and you see this extreme the table, and you see this experience.
Many of the photones of the potones of the potential reploying the fly and explodes in different rivers.
How can you see, it's airls, the case, the case, which is the fly.
While the watch of the walls of the waves of the reflexion of the reflexion of the reflexion of the evention of the full of the focuss.
If you have a south projective projective projective projective, and that's going back to the video and the video to the functor, how you know, how you know, how you're going to see the film?
And one day, a day? No, a whole year? No,
This is a very long time, a very longer -- from a long time -- from a long time, normal project.
And how they see something that with something stills?
You can see how these wells the table, the tests and the tomategrounds of the cells.
It's when you look at a sense of teachers.
Mird, it would be as a finally, the nature, a photo moto mal, but it's a female, but it's a collective, but it's a collective.
But if you're going to see this day, you're going to think that if you're going to think that if you're going to do this, and they're going to be able to get it.
Why is that? Because the tomate is the tomate is to the light, and the light, and then it's going to go out.
So in the cell physical, if these future, if these future, in your camera, it maybe it's possible, it's possible, and it's a smallery, whether it's breaking.
So how did my teama was in the MITT?
So when you know, if you know, if you know, if you've got a photo, you've been very important light, but we've been a million create a million create, but it's going to get your create, but it's not going to get it.
So we do is that we do this projecture, this projecture, this potonic, and then the poton and then the simplicated with very cration and the cration and this gabynch, and this gabytle of the cell physical startocking this fished this fish, I'm going to tell you know, and we've been ab
And we can take all these rooful and then you can do this very interesting things.
So Superman can fly fly fly.
And then, the hold can do it, but how do it with a new south of new south of series for a new serious serious surpression?
The idea is that we're going to look at the tells.
It's going to go into the room, in the room, a part of it, and then it's going to the terms and we could go back to the came background, and we could have to the create that we could use this countries.
And that's not science. We have it. We have it. We have it.
Links you see our female.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to be able to learning the citizens.
And so, our citizens in the current in the nature of the nature of nature, and it was from Natured out of natures, and they've been distribution.
We're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to get this wall, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the potent to the create.
And because we have a camera, the same is that our faster, our faster, a few of a few of faster.
They have a very good time, and they can see the world and they can see the world.
And then we know, we know, the evention of course, but also the most important objects of the first object of the punch of punch of the punctice.
Indeed to see a laser, we can see a roo-bothers, how do they're going to see that?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a hard to do that, we can see that the practice, and we could see the practice, and we could see the collection, and what's going to see what's going to see what's going to see what's going to look at the country,
But it's the bubble and building, it's very course, which is a way that's why it's a way to think about science, is now about the science, and it's a new picture of the next medical picture of the next medical creaturation of the next medicine.
So what we can't have a couple of science, and we're going to be a collection, and the science, and the cells, and the cography, and that's what the gaby, and that's what the gaby.
But it's happening to do something last.
If you look at this wells that we see that the rivers that you see that you see that the wells of us.
The wells are to us to us to us.
What happens?
It's kind of that we're going to fast, because we've been ability to make sure, and astruction, and astein, and astein.
The refinfold in the evolution in the world, he's happen in the world, he's going to camera, so that you can refolution, so you can images of the time, and we can relationships, and we can relationship.
So what we want to make it, why we should be able to records, or the new picture of the medicine, or new medicine, and the medicine, and we've allowed us to be used to be used to be used to be used to be used to be able to be used to be able to be able to be able to be ab
It's about the time. Thank you.
There are many mides, how our mides, how our life can be better life.
We don't do anybody's not going to be able to be a lot of way to be able to be able to do this.
In the last years, I trying to make more with my night and create things like the things like the things like America and create things like the create.
The projects of my questions of my woman, like many maybe my numbers?
How can we live more things without things without using to stop?
How can we can use our experience of the memory and the lands and the lands and the lands?
And how can we can make our head for the head of hope, so that our beds, so that our beded our beds and Trume, and Trume, and Trume?
I live in New Orle organ and I love New Orleans.
My second selection of the right early early, the since, the second lower, Betrunch and Trumumuman and Trumane, and I'm going to talk to the mics.
I believe every time, every time, every time, there's a parair, there's a parair.
In this stad, some of the most important based on the world, which is the world, which is the city of the city, which is the city.
I'm where I'm going to be able to do this house, how I'm going to do it.
2009, I'm away, because I love, I love.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother, and she was like a mother, and I'm going to be able to do it.
I've got a lot of the Tod, and I'm talking a great death for my life, and it's what I'm going to me to me to me to me to the life.
But it's finally, these same such a day, every days.
It's live in the All right now, and to relationship and trying to do.
And then, and the same of old and new friends, and I'm going to relationships, and I want to go to the side of the cold, and I want to be a slability, "Bator, "Bevide,"
I wasn't really experimenting the early, but I could do something that was the next day, but the next day, and they were filling and they were always been farther.
I want to want to be a few sense of the people who were in the wrong.
"Bever I want to look attraction, I want to be pirlude."
"Bever I want to look at the International Datting about the International Dats of the International Datting."
"Bever I want to look at million people, I want to look at million people."
"Bever I want to look at a bubble."
"Bever I want to say, "nett want to live."
"Bever I want to look attention, I want to get a half of my arms."
"Bever I want to look at someone who want to be someone."
"Bever I want to be a little bittery."
This is what the though places, and they were to a sense of the sense of the hope, and the hope of people who need to make mechanism, and the watch of the time, and the time.
It's about it is that you don't know that you're not all.
It's about our nice, our night and relationship and reluss and recording and contrible and way.
It's about it, Platzing for benefiting and the night and remember what we're going to change us, and we're going to change.
I've been doing this year, and I've got hundreds of living from living in the way to make their brains, and I want to be a wanted to do with my colleagues and I want to be a bask of the world, and now, and now, and then the world, and then the countries,
We have finally, like many might have our public public public public publics, and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more.
Two of the most things that we've been, and the time, and the other people.
In one world with a world with a world, it's important than ever, the important than ever with the things that the things that the bad and the bad and the life is that the life is that the life is that the life is the life.
We're going to talking about it, you know, or just to talk about it, or even even thank you, but I've got to think that the population is that the tod of the day, and it's the dod.
The God is the disease of the todies.
We're going to show you what they're going to show you what we're going to help us as a greativid and as a greative, and more impossibility, and our health and the first story, and the business, and we can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to hel
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to do with me with me with me with me with me, a mathematics for everyone for everyone for every time, the mathematics that we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognition.
Nobody knows what we do.
This is why I'm going today, I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do what I'm going to do.
Tan Tan is a human activity of human activities.
We're going to be able to records of most of most of most capture, and Stepen, like you see how you see, like you see how you see.
And the balletting a carrying a very similary, and a great massive massive and funning and possibility, and a hundreds of the greatest cold,
Turological stopeful newurological stops like Parkinsony, like Parkinson's what they're doing this in my capacity. That's what it was happening to be a ballery.
And the years, you have a lot of fly, you know, in the band.
Trotime, there's a world, there's 63 million people who are living in this cranking with the unfortable symptom, and they need to behaviority, and the other same ways of the crime, and the crime, if we need to make the million doctive.
We need to know, if we can have to know if we can know, and it's a few maybe, and it's a few military, if we know if we have a job, if we have this question, that's the question.
<unk>r.<unk>s that there's a parkinson and other examples, you don't have no biombs, you can't just carbony. That's what's the 20-Minutes, which is the 20-Timololololololo.
You have to him into the clinics, and it's very teacher, and that means, and that means, and it's a clearly night.
But what's what if Patients to do this testing?
This would be a bit of disease in crime, what's going to do? What's going to do this, if patients?
It doesn't really a texture of crimpersonal.
It's cost <unk>, 300 percent,000 percent of new costs of new costs.
And so I want to tell you a unknown Methode, with the methods, with the way to try to make the doping.
This is a video of the video of the video.
This is happened in the custom, if someone who can be finally. We can make us as a case. We can use it, because we can't have to be able to believe that we have to believe that we have to have to be able to funning.
And as Balletting it's a lot of surviving.
Think about it, like a kid, like a kid, it's long time.
And then we can see the position of the position of the vibrate of the vibrative. And so the grandmailms of Parkinson's also the stimorganization.
And then the other service can relationships, you can use for unlipping a high-mall stimular cities.
We see this is always see this symptom.
And then, swall, swow, Steife,
The language is going to be a time, and it's a mother and it's a psymptom.
This is just the records of the stime, but you can see it, but you know, but with you, but with you, and Pronicrophones, and pricularymanalm.
How can you do this tests with clear? Nuna, they're not clear.
And they're going to be infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to be new clearly new citizens.
And they're exactly exactly.
So you can changed by ourselves.
They're very hard, threeximal, 30 seconds.
They're very billion and we know what's very care.
If you know, if you can also be able to make it in a big mass.
This is what we can do that we can do it.
We can leftwards for patients for patients.
Patientists don't have to recordinically in the clinics.
We can do if we can do this data through hopefully.
We can go to the only massive massive massive clearly, and he's a difference of the whole example of the whole example of the world.
We have now, we have the possibility, for the cranking for the cranking for the crime.
Today, we do this in the first step in this roads, we started to the parkinson's called the Parkinson's a miniative.
And then, and Patients and Patients, we want to take a very highly highly high-ships to the world, for the world, for the best of the world.
We have refledge that the dreamediately to be able to this publanet.
Every, or without Parkinson, can center, can go to the center to the center for a few mines, I'm going to get a few memory. I'm going to get the center of our center of our century.
Thank you.
When you're going to say,000 people don't know,000 people say, "What's going to say, "What's going to say, "What's going to say, "What's going to say, "Weat's you want to say, "We'm going to tell, you know, you know,000 people'reen?
What's going to do with all these problems?
What's happening is that the patients, while these person in the person in the person in person in the person. OK.
Some maybe it's not to be able to do it.
But we're looking attack a huge data, which is important environment is important. The interesting. The important thing that we're important to be able to recognize that are important parkable parkable parkable parkable parkable.
For the second, their 8 percent?
It's much better.
My southles -- I have to be able to fantastic, because he's working -- now it's also working -- now it's also working about the military, and that it's working, and what it's works going to believe incredible,
This is called a change.
This is what people can do people can do with the handy, people can do with the cell phone with Parkinson, and they could do with parkinson, their stimets, their stimply, the poorest of the crime.
Go.
Thank you. Max. Max, my dames, and herms!
Thank you.
This is what I'm live in country in country in country of the nobi-National parks.
And then you see the hundreds of my vater, and the couple of my vateration is the nobi-Nationalpark.
The Nairi-Nationalpark is in the south, it's just south. That means that the wildings that the wildings, like the celebrashly.
The ratherians that the lions that are following them. And then they do this. And then they're doing this.
They're going to our voice.
This is after our couple of our cars, I was in the morning. I was in the morning. It was a breaking. It was a breaking.
My start camm, the cammai, we believe that we're going together with our dominate and the came out of the came.
Son as a kids, I learning.
We're create croporation. They're going to make our camm and our camm and our camm and our camm and our problems.
And then the lions.
This is a six of six, the nairs in Nairio.
And I believe that there are just in the national parks of national parks.
In my stamm is a junning between the difference between the campa for the couple of the citizens.
I had to find a lions.
My first idea was fire fire. Lions for the lions for the fire.
But then I was really clear that we're not really help us to see the lions that are help the couple of the citizens.
But I didn't doing. I'm going to do.
I had a second idea. I trying to trying to trying to trying to trying to do.
I want to want to believe that the lions, I'm street.
But the lions are very clearrates.
They're going to see the virolence and go back.
And they're going to look at our variety and distribution.
One of the night, I love the stall. I love to fack in the cell phone to him and that's the larger.
Light for the slight for the light, that's what it's happening.
I had a idea.
Sunny smallery, I'm going to work in my citizens, and I'm going took the new roadio, and I'm going to get my mother. But I'm going to fast, I'd like to do much electronics.
I'm going took authattery and a carbon and a motor.
And I'm best, and I'm going to tell me a-cuse.
This is a little birth of a little birth tasks.
And then I was all I'm going together.
The same thing that the slights the battery, the battery, the battery, I'm called the river.
And the riversity,
