When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the clener of the clener.
My father was hearing on his little, graen Radio the news of the BBC.
He saw very happy, what was pretty unusual, because of the things was pretty much depressed.
He rest: "The Taliban are familiar!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father was very happy, very happy.
"You can go to a right school school," he said.
I'm going to forgether, I'm never forget.
A rough school.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I spent it was girls to school.
And so I five years, I five years long as a boy and I started my older sister, my older sister, who don't have anymore, to a simple school.
Only, we could go to school.
Every day, we couldn't take a different way, even never money, where we went to where we went to where we went to.
We hided our books in the left, so we could just go out of the books as if we just go.
And we've been in a house, we've been in a small wall walls in a small well.
In the winter was, but incredibly, but incredibly, it was incredibly incredibly hot.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the time, the bottom of the difference of a week, because the Taliban power, because the Taliban power.
We were never sure how much they knew how much they knew about us.
Do they asked us?
Why do they knew where we know where?
We had angry, but we wanted to school.
I had lucky in a family in a family in the education as important and turned into the education.
My grandfather was being far.
One of approaches from a decided provinced Afghanistan. He was to school, his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- to school and it was daded by his father.
My basically, my mother, but teacher.
That's what they do.
Two years ago, she went to the ruhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here was the first in his family, who was the first one school picture.
For him, it was a clear that his children would be a children, even his kids, even his daughter, drots the Taliban, trots every risks.
He looked like a lot of bigger Risk, his children's not to school.
I know that I'm just approached in the years, sometimes, sometimes was so early by our lives, from our lives, and the perspective.
I had good lust, I had told you, but my father said, "Thter, you can hear me. You can lose your life.
No, your money can be carbon. You can be done in war.
But one thing is going to be done, that's always going to be here. And even if we have to pay with our blood for your blood for your schools, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I've been destroyed by war.
Less than 6 percent of women, my age of my age, a higher than the second baby as the second, and if my family, and if my family for my school picture, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as stolice Absolventin of the Middlebury College.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was my family who was done by his family because he was waiting his daughter to school, one of the first time that I was greated to school.
He doesn't just like my high school, but also with my high school, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman,
My family believe me.
I've got big dreams, but my family has still a greater trees for me.
So I'm global bottom of 10x10, a worldwide for 10x10, a world's a world for the education of women.
And so I've helped SOLALA, SOLA, and perhaps a few Internat for girl in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country,
It's wonderful to see how the shoes of my school with great earliers with big early chances.
And to see how their parents and various for them, as well as well as well as well as well, and I decided to change the resistance.
So as Ahmed. That's not really his face, and I can't show you, but Ahmed is the father of my dad.
At a months ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village and they're the death of the roads on the streets of minutes.
When he was home, came up with home, and a voice, and a voice him, he would be falling back to school, they would try to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "This is, if you want to say, but I'm not going to use the future of my daughters on playing away from age older and surgery.
What Afghanistan, I realized something that I realized something that's owned in the West, most often, most of us, most of us who are successful, the success of our daughter, and the result of his daughters.
That's not today that our mothers don't play in our successful role in our success.
They're a lot of them are half the people who are involved and convinced to a lot of their distance of their testimate future. But in a society like the in Afghanistan is the unfortable.
Our the Taliban went to school hundreds of girls -- because it was someone illegal.
But today, everyone in Afghanistan about three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans areas, how we're going to see how our change change.
I'm notice that the changes are not from the drawers and repeating the United States.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I look at the school, and their parents who are looking at their parents who they're going to use it, then I see a lot of parents that they're a lot of future and a lot of walls and a long wall.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope of hope and the unfortunities, and it remember every day, and I remember the girls that SOLALA.
And as I've got a big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do what I do is, also, my life -- my life was done by seven years of work in Africa than ever,
In 1971, I see, I see it, I'm not -- I'm not -- I've got in Sambia, Kenya, the Elime, Algeria, algaeks of technology, algae countries working with African countries.
I've worked for a Italian NRO, and every single project that we're on the legs that we're on the legs.
I was doubt.
I thought, 21 years, we thought that we're working in Africa, and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we had all of what we're doing.
Our first project, which is my first project, which my first book "Ripples of the cambe, one that we wanted to show you how food sambias, like Noodbias.
We came with Italia, in South Americ South America, in this topics, which leads to Sambia. We leads to Sambia. We lived the sky of the animals and Zucian table.
Of course, the answer has no interestsolutely not interesting about it, so we're doing it for work, and sometimes they're also looking at it.
We were amazing that there was a such an early talence in a so economy.
But instead of wonder why they didn't look at the simply saying, "God," we're here!"
"Gerade is just a real time to save people to save the people to save the collection."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these practices. In Italy. In Italy, they were so big, in Sambia so big,
We couldn't believe it and said, "Skin, looked at the same landwareness."
When the tomates were red, came up about 200 nights about 200 nights and asked it out of the flows and asked everything.
We said to the Sambiern: "Oh God, the nilpferred!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a landwareness here."
"Why didn't say that, "I'm not saying, "I'm never asked us."
I thought we were so greated in Africa, but then I saw what the Africa, but then I saw what the Americans doing the English, which was doing what the Franzo, I saw what they did was pretty strong with our project.
We felt the nonprofits.
They should see the unmind -- you should see the unminds that we don't see the university of African people.
They should be the book "Thead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambian economic economic economics.
The book was published 2009.
We have been given the African continent 1,5 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has this money.
Let me just her book.
Les you have a African, what we've started in the story.
We're important people are imperialists, colonialists, missionary, and there's only two ways of people around people, or we're patriarchalic.
Both words are stucked by the latest "pather" which means "Vather" which means "Vather"
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalic: I'm treated everyone else, as if they were my kids. "I love my kids.
Patronizing: I'm treated anyone else, as if they were my dying my dyermin.
That's why people in Africa, Chef, Chef, Chef,
I was growing up when I was the book "Small I was the book," by school," he said, "Small," he said, if people don't want to help people to wanted to water, then they don't want to get it into the row.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is Respect.
Today, the herrifying the heart of these conference, and he asked a stabet, and asked, "Can you're not going to imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react on people, and he's going to react a system called companies, which is never going to be a little bitiased once, but you will never be able to distributed to the distribution of the passion of the position of the position.
What you do -- you do is, you're going to make the mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you're going together with the sky.
We're not working from bros.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We do it in Cneipen.
We have no infrastructure.
We finally foundations and find out what the person wants to find out what the person.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can make someone else an idea.
If these person doesn't like this?
The passion for the passion for the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own growth is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge, because no one can be allowed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to find it.
The person with the idea hasn't have the knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this instead of stattle in a community and saying, why do we should hear them, why don't we hearing them? But not in community.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
Our brains have never been part of it, and they're never public, which they're going to see what they want to see what they're seeing for money.
Planation has this blindow.
The clearly people who knows the community of community because they never have never been able to create.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, has to be social infrastructure, which isn't existed.
A new board to be created.
This is the house of the companies of the company of the bedroom, who's house that you're in your caf<unk> and in the caf<unk> sitting you're going to find your passion to find your lifestyle to transform your lives.
I have this in It's trying to try and trying to try.
I promoved to the time and tried to get the time and trying to tell what they should do, where we should do what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had just walked in the first three days, and I had him. I him. I him. He was him. He was a garage, he was Maori. I him took him, and I him took a restaurant in Perthanism.
I half these fish fish fishers and working with these wonderful three-fished throwings in Albany for 60 cents, but for 60 cents, but for 15 dollars for 15 dollars."
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and hope."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Make it."
We've done it in 300 community in 300 community.
We've been helped 40,000 companies.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go to available.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the story, story, starting a few years ago.
Peter Drucker was Philosophyprofessor, before he was recorded to create company, Peter said, Peter said, Peter said, Planation is independential and economic society."
Planation is the death of death of the entrepreneurs.
So you built christches, without knowing what the course of human course, with their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these to get these together.
You have to tell them Disk and privacy, and privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
For the presentation of the presentation, you've got today?
<unk>rime, empower people. The eating you have applauded.
I want to say that compared to say that companies is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial Revolution -- nicherbare fossil fossil fuels, fuels, and suddenly, there's no systems that are not sustainable.
The connection of the future is not sustainable.
The friend of the instandard of the instandard.
We need to look at how we have to build billion people on the sustainable ways to recording, biling, transporting to corresponding them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will revolution for the green revolution? Universities? Universities? Can you're you?
The government? Do you're you.
It's going to be create. And they're going to do it.
I'm going to make a future in a future of many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were embracted to the future of New York in the city of New York in 1860.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happened in 100 years with the city of New York City was a city: The shelful: The city was a city: The city wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? You saw the curve and said, if the population in this tempoint in this tempoint in this tempox million pounds to people who were to be able to listen to people who are impossible to be increased with the mistakes of millions of power.
Because they went down in the mistake.
1860, they see the difficult technology that life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, 19001, there was 1001 Automobily -- 1001, 1001.
The idea that one other technology had done, the running. There was a little fabrics in the back of the background.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with company to work with companies.
And when he's got to be able to get them to be able to be.
One of them, they don't talk about you.
And as next thing you have to tell them, engaged, engaged and empathy.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth over the entrepreneurs.
From the smallest company to be able to be able to sell you, three things out of the line: The product, the product of production, the consumption, and his financial production, and his financial.
Rather?
We never have a single person who can buy a single person who can buy something produce the same time and sells to the money.
That's not existed.
This person was never born.
We've written by the research and the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Fordinary, Fordinary, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that allowed all of the world has been a successful companies, only one: No, just one person who was just one person.
Now, we're going to live 16-year-old in Northumbers, and we started to start the first two side of Richard Branson Autobiography Branson Autobiography, and the first two-year-oldships. The first two-year-olds.
Nobody's called "wir" and 32 times.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody green a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we create a community, in the average that you have a little bitterground, in Caf<unk>s and Bars and Bars and Barships, your engaged campaign for them to do what someone is going to do with you.
What can you make it? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you're going to take the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Mill you think I'm going to finish?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of freedoms that can be undergrounded by the companies that are helping them to help them. We've got to help them. We've got out that the wonderful context of the intelligence of the economic economics and the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be able to be age, Alice in the wonderful.
The penn State University, I asked me -- a Dozentin for communication -- in the communications in communications.
I had angry --
Rightly anxiety. Afraid of these students with their big brains and their big big books and their big books, and their big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big b
But as the conversation of the conversation, he went back to me as Alice as Alice as Alice, and a cannins to a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I was talking about the students with the students. I was just remember the thought that they had just wanted to be able to discovered that other wonderful.
I think that to open this door to open this door, it means it's great communication.
We need to change incredibly great communication of our scientists and engineering the world.
Because our scientists and ingenery, thejects that our greatest problems that our greatest problems, energy, energy, and if we don't understand it, and if we don't know about it, and I think it's not going to believe that weight. I think it'm not going to believe in our responsibil
But these great conversation come together, if our scientists and engineers and in their wonderful conversation.
So scientists and engineers, bits, clearly clearly.
I want to show you a few answer that we can see how to make it, we can see that the science and technology and technology, with their technology and spaneously, sexy and spaneous.
The first question that you need to tell us, is, and?
Sayt us why was just a scientific own scientific are so relevant for us.
Say not just that their trabells using their traffics, but also says that their trabells us that their traffic structure in our cooks, because they're important structure in our cookings, because they can understand it.
And if you're going to do what you do is, then you're using father.
Fromators are a hinds of change,
Sure could use their doctors and pretty much and pretty much, but why doesn't just changing its not just a lot of time, and time, what's a lot of us?
Our thought that you can do is not the same thing as their nive buildings like their niveaughters.
How one thing that said, "Make the things like this, the things like possible -- but not easy."
You can tell us something about eual scientific area, without a scientific basically, without compromise.
A few things are coming back to bring back, examples: Because of the stories and analogies. At the way that might be able to turn it into your banned.
And if you're doing your work, then the stories, then the stories.
Habt you ever asked young, why it's called "Stichpoint."
What happens when someone is that if someone else? One, and with these points, and with these points, and with these points.
A following this is not just long as this is not just a very slowly too very language part of our brains and dading our brains and dading.
These example of geneview of geneview brown is much we showed that the special structure of the special structure of the trabekels so stability for the inspiration for the inspiration of the effecture of the effecture.
The trick here is a single thing to use a single sentence, satzing the audience that can be lossible, orients can related the fail and pictures that are also approaching both of our others and graphics, and they're going to make a term.
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these door and the wonderful and the science and the technology and the technology and technology.
There's the engineers that I've been involved in my early, with the <unk>Nerd in me, I want to make all of contact with a same with a same.
As it's a science of education and education, and your father, participate that's all says that's important, which is important, and multiplicated the gane that's important to their own work, and it's incredible work. And it's incredible.
So scientists and engineers, if you're going to have this same thing, clearly me, I'm incredibly unbed me.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy can be a cell phone in Syria in Syria.
With a handy can tweet a news and a protesta work in <unk>gype of <unk>gype of Egypt.
And with a handy can take a long time, it's high-roud and board and board.
All of that's possible.
I've been in 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the city in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people who went to change the streets and the constrated.
We're in 1989, and we're in 1989, and we've been able to change the cell phone in the tasks, a handy in the task.
Who in Saal has a handy there?
Hald it.
Half you high phone, you're high, you're high!
Hald it. One, a souple of a blackberry, which is a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy talk about me and my hands, and it has changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 350 cells of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.Kommission is a reline.
This is called Rightlinie is called Rightlines.
This direction is that every particularly in European society in Europe, every Internetdia, a bandbread Europe, a bandbread of bandbreads.
Who do you get a bit? Who's a email?
Who's a sentence?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information will be six months to two years of your telephone from your phone of your phone or your Internetanbia or your Internetanbia.
And everywhere in Europeans are the people on Europe, "That's not."
They said, we want to tell these imagination.
We want to be self-making self-making time and we don't want to be able to tell the telephone and Internetdies, and we need to talk about us.
There was an advice, Journalists, Preester, who all said, "That's not."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of Berlin streets and said, "Freeth."
And some of them said, this could be able to stasium 2.0.
The stasi was the secreti in Ostance.
And I asked to ask me if that's really works.
Can you really know all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phoney, I asked my telecom that was the greatest telephone who was the biggest telephone in Deutch, and I asked them, and I asked me told me about her information that you've been talking about me.
And I asked her, she asked them, and she wondered, and they didn't get a right answer.
But then I said, I want to have these information because it's my life is because it's protocolated.
So I decided to get a general directly, they wanted to have these information because I wanted to have these information.
But the carrier telecom said, no, no, we will not give you that information.
At the end of it came to a similar with them.
I'm going back to the beginning of where they all sorts of information.
Because in the second time, the basically decided that the increase of the E.U.
So I'm going to have this half of environment with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
350 cells information.
First, I saw it, and I said, well, it's half a huge date. Myetweet.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this datei.
So I was a little bit of skeptic, what should I start with it?
Because you see where I'm where I'm going to be sleeping what I do.
But then I said, I want to go with these information information.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people what is the preventing prediction.
So without time oil, and Open Data City, so I've done this here.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reinceooms and racooms, you can imagine.
You can do every step, I do, I do it, after that.
And you can see how I'm going to see how I found from Frankfurt with the stuff, and how many answer I'm doing different.
All of that is possible to this information.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just as I call my wife, and she running me, and we talk about a few times.
And then I went to a few friends and they run a few friends.
And after a while you and you run and you've got this huge communicationnetwork.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they're going to go to the time they go to Bettle, they walked to Bettle.
You can see all of it.
You can see the central figures, about who are the leaders of the groups.
If you can see a stuff, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a bauplan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect developed developed a society about how to reday, because you know who know who's a profession, who's possible, everything that's possible to these information.
And these information will be information for months, in Europe, in Europe to 2 years.
How I said to remember that all of these people in the streets in the streets in 1989 Handys in 1989 Handys in their tasks.
And the stasi, who had been wonstration of the Demonstration of the demonstration, who would have been a leaders who are never happened.
The case of the Berliner Mauerliner maybe not states.
And also, not the case of the case of your ice.
Because now today, instead of information and companies like many information, as many information, like they can wrote about us.
They want to have the opportunity to success our lives, and they want to learn all the time.
But self-bestimate and a life in the digital time, not a video.
But everyone has to help for the self-making today.
They have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you're going to say that privacy is a wertain of 21st century, and that's not altmodic.
If you go home, you're going to say your attractive, just because companies have to have the possibilities, the possibilities, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think that if you ask your phone, you've got your phone who have security that they've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you remember your handy, you remember the self-making the self-making time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituosens, snellrestaurants, brestaurants, broughts.
So the city planets, and so the name South Central South Central Central Central, so it's changed him in South Los Angeles, as if it's something that's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituosens, snellrestaurants, broughts.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drival Los Angeles and the Drival bys.
The comic is that the driving more people than the drive-by-bys.
People sat down in South Central Los Angeles.
The father is in my father's fourth of my fourth is created as a higher than about 15 kills, which is about 15 kilometers.
I couldn't go to transform it.
And I asked me, asked me, if you'd have a stuff, if you had no access to health if you'd have to see every time you see the negative expectations that are going to see the best expectations that has been on your fourth system.
I'm going to buy the role of the role and sells how buy buying buildings.
I see decades, I see how Starbucks like Starbucks.
And I've got to stop that the ones.
I captured that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And then I had no latest on 45 minutes on 45 minutes to get a pesticians that's not with pesticians.
So I plant, I plant a food-wald Walday.
It's a piece of land that we call Parkanlage.
It's 45,000 feeters.
The thing is the thing that it's the city of the city.
But you have to pay it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is because my responsibility is my responsibility."
And I decided to hold it in Stand.
So I came up and my groups that LA. Green reason, and we started together, and we started together, and own food, soon, so that's all the program, so the whole program, so the whole program.
We're a kind of imagination, and we're made out of all social signs and all of these social signs and all the city, it's completely free, and everything we do, is cost.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone else.
The city city came up and he told me, and he said that I had told me that I had told my garden, I had to be a richered to a richeral ancient institution.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A richters of foods, apply from food on a piece of food, that's really great dead?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her so. Her so that."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times, Times, Steve Lopezzzzled lope, and talked about the city and talked to the city of Green Roundation. They were a petition of Green Roundation, and we were excited with 900 difference.
We'd give you in the hands.
My city rather than highway, and he said that they're doing it.
So why would they do that?
LA.
They're best 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flying to plants to plants to plants.
Why didn't find the phone?
Through the an influence of a plant, you're 1,000 sames.
With green Bohan in the wert of a dollars, you're own own and community of 75 dollars.
It's my heils, I say, I say that they should be able to build their own food.
His eating food is how his own money is how his own money.
Look, I have a considered in South Central.
I'm going to stand up there. I've got my sons.
And I'm sured to be part of this imagined reality, and I fabricians, and I fabricians, and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden is my graffiti. I plants my art.
All right, like a graffiti-course, the walls, the walls, I'm a beautiful, I'm a parklagen.
I use the garden, the Earth, the Earth, and the plants and the plants are my dreams for these hope for these hope.
They would be surprised what the Earth, if you can use it as a line as a line.
You can't imagine how it's a sunlume is a sunlume is, and how they're leadership.
So what happened?
I've been experienced to a instrument for the experience and the construment of my fourth.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the ground.
We're the bottom.
They would be wonderful as children's going to be able to be able to be.
Garden is the therapists of the therapist and coastic and coastic, especially with the city.
You know, you're going to get a superience.
I remember this time when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30, she was came up in my garden, and I came out.
I'm sure you feel like, because they were there, because they were there, and I said, "Wisst you have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been wonder if I saw people who were so close to me, and I was just asked me, and that's just asked me, "Fin, people are not going to ask me, you're not going to be food."
And I said, "Thy teaching, no, I don't know what they're smart.
And it's not too line on the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want you to take their healthy, I want her health."
At a different time, I was a garden in this obdession in Downtown LA.
These are the guys who have helped me to decided to decided.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it was conflicting it, and how they've been able to see with her mother and her grandmother and it was great, and it was great if it's just changed for a moment.
Green reason has been planted about 20 garden.
To our environmental environment, and they've been able to do with all freewillions.
If kids carbon, it eat children.
If they taken Tomata, they eat domata.
But if they don't get anything about it when they don't get the food and body as food and body eating conflicts, they eat, they eat, they're eating them.
I see young people who work, but they want to work, but they're in this thing -- I see -- I see that's exactly on the path, and they're going to go on the path, and they're going to go on.
The gardens I see a sense of what we can train these kids can train themselves to care their communities to care after life.
And if we do that, who knows who knows?
We could bring the next few George Washington Carverton Carver.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Earth, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole wanted to garden plants where people can share the food in the same blocks.
I want to take a shipscontainer and they're using in health caf<unk>s.
So, don't understand me.
I'm not talking about costs, because it's not sustainable.
The comics of night is that you have to have to behavior.
I'm talking about people, people working to hold people, and children from the streets, and they're going to record the streets and the eating, if you're going to be able to build bars, and if you build barmarkets.
So what I want to do here is this sexy to do here.
I want to be able to all the ecological rebell, Gangster, Gangster,
We need to start the picture of Gangsters.
If you don't have a ganger.
If you're going to be selling, right?
And let's just read the waffected.
If you want to make meeting, right, you don't want to make meeting in a counter, and you want to do what you want to do is to do is to do something about it.
If you want to make meet meeting your sell, you're going to take a little bit of my garden, so we can use any sort of power.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite switching in the entire Oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No,"
Although in 19th century, a newspaper in 19th century, "It's a better definition," which is someone who is someone who is an astream of parentian, program or line, program or line, program or line, programming the power of power of power of p
I have no idea what's called "spracheral."
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all politicians that they're trying to control.
For example, for example, third loud of the British Parlament, time, not the exact skin of the debating.
And that was actually back to the mutes of a man's a man who was a man's extraordinary names Brass Crosby, who was similarlament.
She was helped him in the Tower of London and he was a muthor, but he was mutig enough enough to address, and he was so much unfortunately so much difference in London, he was so much unfortunately that he was won.
And just a few years later, we find the first night, we find the first night, "so strong as Brass. Viety.
Brassrooms on the English word for books.
But that's not true. It's not going back to a relative of pressure.
But to show you how words areas and politics are lowered to the United States, I want you to take the United States, as they were just reached to the unability.
You saw the question of how to build George Washington, the state of Washington, we should call it.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leadership of a republic nation?
And that's been debate in Congressed in Congress.
And there was all kinds of possible proposition.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernor Washington, and other, other, and other, other, and other, against other botton, and other botton, and other people of America Washington.
Not so that's not a present.
Some people wanted to call him a nice nice.
They thought that's been dangerous.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king time.
It would have been working.
But everyone was unbelieved, because these debate 3 weeks, because these debates.
I have the day of a senator of a senator that's still the same thing: "Immer the same is the same thing.
The reason for the connection and the long time was that the representation was that the representation.
The representanted not to say that what's going to do is not going to do. They wanted to him.
Can you call it, and it's possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get it.
They wanted to him the most painting, the most painful title, the most painting.
This title was "President."
President. They didn't existed the title. He existed. But he's existed to be a vamered that someone was a vameration.
It's like the prediction of a Jury.
He hadn't have more reason than the recording "Apasser" or "Apasser."
Sometimes, there were president smaller colonial community and governments, but it was really an incredible title.
So that's why the senat him.
They said, "That's long, you can't call him President.
This cerles has to be able to write and from countries and from citizens.
Who will take him, if he's going to take a dumbs like President of America?"
And also after 3 weeks, the senat on the senat.
Instead of the course of the title of the title of the power of the course of the course, but they wanted to make it away, they didn't know that they were able to do that they were able to civilization and methods.
You can learn about three interesting things.
First, I think, and I've got to find out -- until now, I don't find if the satisfy, the sense of the title president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title was just about it.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something temporary -- then you've got 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important point, that's the most important point, the Titel President of America" of America" is not so the familiar today, right?
This has something more than 5,000 nuclears to do something more than 5,000 nuclear volcancial economy of the world and a photograph of the world and this whole currently.
And it's really a story and story has given the size of the size.
And so the senat at the end of the end of the end of the end.
They have a respectables.
And the other sensors of the sense of the sense of illness -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147th.
Because they all like this, like the clings, like the cerling five limits of five limits.
So the end of the senat and the representances, because no one has been lost because no one who feels the whole thing that you're going to feel that you're going to be the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take with, and with the decide.
Politicians trying to use the reality to create the reality and the reality to control the reality of reality, but actually changes the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelled a campaign for dialabadium, a 19-year-old, fire of Jacksonville, Florida.
I'd thousands of my black coverse Halby country, and I needed a pair of lederate country, and we could see a rocket that I couldn't see a rocket.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
She was slowly, I was written with the war, all of the warning new pyjama Pyjama Partys and football playing with ristic south and footprints with ristic southerns and religionalists.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here, I'm here, citizen Afghane, Southeast Atheists God, Atheist and a radically politized artists, and a radically politized nine years in Afghanistan, and worked in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do a lot of things that you couldn't make a personality, but I want to make sure that are personality, I want to make art and cars that are able to find outcome and cars and cars and carrying the reality and reality and recording the reality and response.
I want to spend a day in life of a distributed -- Gangster who spend his distributed communists like <unk>Popstar Bling, and they religious population and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's sunlihad-Gangster, as a parlament to candidate a choice and a choice with the Slogan: "What's myself! I'm talking to me! I'm talking."
And trying to use these campaigns to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosiosiosize the nationalhels.
I want to take a corruption in Afghanistan on the reason, and I called "Ruth," which you're going to take a wrong, and you're going to take a wrong control of cars and cars on the streets and cars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan of my mind, my minds of "modic conflict.
The war and the war and the free-making answer that have been came up with him, and we created a new environment for style and models that you can only a model of soldiers and self-mode and self-mordinating in the fellow of the cell physics.
And I would like to see how a simple shopping a simple cabul between cardipling approach from 18999, and weapons to create a dialographics that the hotives of their woods in the past monitiatives of the pastics.
But for all these things can come in prison, they can be missed, they can be missed.
But I'm doing it because I have to slow the geography of self-fired itself.
That's my favorite. What is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since a time, I was working as a model.
Second 10 years, right?
I have the feeling that sense here in the room, because I would have a uncomfortable spannot be able to start this cleidemic.
And lucky, I've got something like this.
This is the first time that someone who's the first time to see someone on TED books, so you can see that happy to see.
If you really have a few women really explored when I got out, you need to say that I don't need to say that later.
I also think that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very course 10 seconds, which you think about 10 seconds of me.
And that's not everyone has chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to be carrying.
The most difficult part is to pullover, the pullover about my head, because then you'll all going to be able to do, so long as long as head.
In order today.
Why did I do that?
That was personal.
Well, it wasn't so picture as this image.
One is a powerful, but a image is also a surface.
I've just changed your opinion of me in 6 seconds of my own.
And on this picture -- I had never been never a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and photograph, I was so I'm so possible to my hand in the hand in the hand in the half of this guy.
And then, from operations or the wrong bridge I wrong two days ago, I've been very few matters for the work of our own opportunities, and our questions, and our own own quite, although it's a bigger -- although, and our lives influence -- although, our lives.
Through to be hot to be hoth today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a high woman, and I know, and in my branch, and we call this sexy girls.
I'm going to ask the questions that people who always ask me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How will you get a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means, but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, is a building in the genetic lottery and a important experience and maybe you're going to ask you.
Now, in the last few century, we don't just beauty and young, and young, and yetrically defined, we're using biological programmed, but also, finally, finally, but also hospital.
This experience was created for me. And it's a same for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Lui Wen Smalls."
And increasingly comments, I'm going to be a teacher.
But I've got to tell you that in 2007, a very at the year 2007, a very experienced in the NYU all Models on the lunch of NYU, every single time, and that was booked by 767, and that was only two percent of the process of two percent or less than two percent of percent of the provides
The next question that I always been said, "Kann I'm going to be a model, if I'm going to grow up?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know what it's not because it's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to give these little girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all being.
You can be presidentinent of the U.S. or the inventin of the next Internets or a Ninja-Herzirurg Dichinter, which is to be irregal, because then you know, because then you're going to be the first."
If they're still thinking about this great, no, no, no, no, Cameron, I want to say, "Who," then I say, "Whode my cameron."
Because I have no responsibility for nothing and you could be the cowerful of American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp; or the next surface of H<unk>amp; Meisel.
To say that you're going to be a model, it's so that you want to say that sometimes you want to be a jackpotto the lotto.
You can't possible, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I've been able to tell you about the other than helling the other than helling it can only just just just just just just just fold.
If you're going to be a photograph, and that's just like a nice, and the couple of course, and the couple of cameron, and then you want to go to the legs, and then you go to the box, and then you go back to the poor, and this poor, this poor, and this poor, that'side, you goes
It's what it looks like this.
Hopefully comic than the middle.
That was ... I don't know what's happened.
If you're going to have a life and a life, and a few Jobs has done, you can't say that you can't say that you're not going to say that you're going to be a lot of the United States, but in life, you'll go to the life, you get come up with a difference.
The next question that I'm often saying, "Who's all photos retire all photos?"
And yes, so pretty much of photos will retire, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is the most picture of the most picture I didn't have the most of all the time I had a bicini, I had no one biciniode.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girls.
So I saw a few months to be a few months with my grandmother.
This is what I'm at the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is I'm on a pyjama Party, a few days before a Shooting for the French Vogue.
This is what I'm with the football team and in the v-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's constructs and it's construction of a group of profis, from Hawylists and Make-up coast and photographs and photographs and the prediction and the prediction and the production.
Okay, askay, when people ask me, people always say, "Creeksonst?"
Yes, I've got too many 20-cm-Abs that I never met, but the things that I never getting things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it, and we're not talking about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went to a day, and I went into a laden and I had my money. And you gave me the cambridge for the cambridge for the cambridge.
When teenager, I went to my friends with my friends, and they were talking about a red launch of course, and of course, we needed to be a redlection, "It's going to further," and we could further.
I have this costs of my costs of my exceptions and not because of my personality and there are people who are people who are people who are personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last decades, 85 percent of the last year, 85 percent of the latinos and most of the men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men and Latinos, for the question, "Who I'm going to ask, "Who I'm going to ask you?"
So, "How often I'm going to take away? When I'm going to see?"
And I found my rights for these talks for these talks that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers are 17 percent when they're 17 percent when they're 17 percent.
The last question is, "How is it, how is it, it's a model?"
And I think they're expecting these answer: "If you're going to have a little bit of harm, you feel a little bit of harm, you feel very happy and fabulous and fabulous.
And Backstage, we've given answer that maybe this eindruck.
We say, "It's really great, so much too much, and it's greative, inspiring people, living inspiring people."
All that's true, but it's just a half of the story, because what we never before the camera says, "I feel the camera, I've never seen me, "I feel like me."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think about my exception.
And if you ask yourself, "What would I be happy if I had to be happy if I had to have your legs and glimate?"
Then you should make a few models, because they have the thinest legs, because they've got the most communities and the coolest coolest coolest coolest women who are the most of their exhibiting women on the planet.
When I was noticed this talk, he was very difficult to me very difficult to tell me, a real bit of a real bit, because I felt very unfortunately, I've been very uncomfortable, and say, "I got all the prediction of my grandman.
It was preparently difficult, a result of difficult, and repression, when I'm a bigger and race often by the greatest nutrients.
But I'm also happy and I'm going to stand here, and I'm going to be able to finish it, and I've been here, before 10 or 20 or 20 or 30 years or 20 or 30 years, and my career, because I wouldn't feel like my career, because I wouldn't feel like my career.
If you take a little bit of this talk, then we're allowed to make the power of imagination and following the power of the imagination and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never forget the words of my grandmother, which is the exilts in the exil of life is, "Son, easily Gaddafi Worldafi Worldafi Worldafi Worldafi Worldafi Worldafi Worte.
But who never would never be something like a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the libyric Revolution is inspirated by the waves of the waves of the waves of the mass of the massive revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, inside and outside the libyens, to a day of the Zorns and to start a revolution of the tyrannic revolution to start the tyrannic Regime Gadaffis.
And there was a big revolution.
Now, the boy difficult women and men stood in the first range of the first range of the regimes, highest slogans of the rule of the freedom, and social community in the air.
They've got aware of mutes, by turning them by by terrutal Dictatur Gaddafis.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the farmers, from the famous oast, until the south.
Finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 toted, and almost 50,000 tyranize our country and the tyranians and the tyranians.
But Gaddafi, every big big big big basically, a consumption of the Tyrannei, the reason for corruption and the reason for cours.
Over four decades had gaddafis Tyrannic Regime, the infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the lybic society.
The consciousness and the challenge, I asked, I as many other women, I as many other women who are civil society lybia, and we're going to build available and national discovery and national exhibited.
And so, in 200 organizations were during and about 200 organizations in Benghazi, almost 300 in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in Exil, I came back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasmusiasmus, I started to the topicshopshopshopships and leaderships.
With a wonderful group of women, I women who I women, I women, a movement of women, a movement of women, leaderships of women who are solution to the public heads.
And I met the payer I met on a very difficult environment, a surfeld, a polarized polarized by the egoistic politics of Dominanic politics of Dominancian politics.
I lived a initiative of peace and women who knows a women, and I'm going to have a laws, a laws, a law, each bitters, each bitters, and that should be citizens and country to country and country.
At the end of our initiative and successful.
Women women 17,5 percent of the National Congresses in the first few five years.
But long, but the eye, the euphories and the whole revolution to <unk>n the whole revolution to each day, we went to new news of violence.
One morning, we've been able to change the money of the money and Sufi-Gralter Mosche.
One of another morning, we've got after the Mord at American bottoms and the angriff on the science.
At again, the morning of opening the army of opening.
And really, every day, we're going to see different from the milize of the milize of the miles and their own missions of regular power and their faces and laws.
Our society, created by a revolutionary, polarized polarized, polarized by the ideal and principles and principles, social community, social community.
Intolerancial, explained and Rache, the Icones of the evolution of the revolution.
I'm not today today today with the success of our recording to our reverse, and the choice of our reverse.
And I'm going to talk today, I'm going to be a nation that we've been done, and the wrong decisions.
We've been able told our priorities.
Because the choice would have been still have stability or sure of sure in Lybia.
Hat the rubber of rubbers and the wheels between female and men and men's female and national virtual virtual version?
No, that's not.
What is it?
Why will our society is going to polarized and dominated by self-f-shinancial politics of the dominance and the exploration of men?
Maybe the women didn't have the only thing that has female, but the female of the female of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the w
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensidered as they brought the choice of choice, the polarization and decision and decision and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative construction of the webs of the female, quantitative construction of the website.
We need to listen to the name of the corns of the corns and a day of the roach of the roach.
We need to start to start to create the middle and the gnade.
We need to develop a female discovered that the following waiting waiting, but also to replace: Gnade, instead of collaborative, approach, approach, applusion.
These are the ideal that are a voice that has to be crimined by warning lybia, to make free peace.
Because the peace has a alchemy and in this alchemics, it's about the femines and masculines.
That's the real rubbers.
And we need to use existence, before we're doing it sociopolitically do it.
After a trial called "Salam" -- Fried <unk> <unk>-clike God,"
The word "rawing" back in all of the abrahamic tradition, and they've known as the same Arabic Wurzel like the word "rahemics," and symbolized the mother, and the whole female of humanity and the whole female of humanity and the humanity.
And just like the motherleible of the embryo, which is the most completely completely the size of the compassion of the compassion of the compassion of the compassion.
And so, we said, "My grade Gnade Gnade all things."
And so, we said, "My Gnade has been a prepared."
And so we're going to be all the gnade of the gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country, and I grew up with the lowest of the world, and I'm going to bring the lower.
And I was very proud.
In school, we've got the story of Kim Il-Sung, but we learned not very much about the world, exception, eye, America, South Korea and Japanese are our fine.
Although I was often asked me, asked me, I thought, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until athing time.
And so I saw years, I saw a public head, but I thought, my life in North Korea, my life in North Korea's normal.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to live with myself.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter of war, from the Swestter of a collegin.
Darin stood: "If you're going to be here, our five families don't have been able to be able to be since two weeks.
We love together, and our bodies are so difficult to be switched."
I was so hocked.
I hearded to hear the first time that people in my country.
I went to the bahnof, I went to the bottom, and I saw something that I can't get more from my memory.
A live woman lose woman on the ground, and approached child in their army in their army.
But no one was half of them because all of them, because all of them were so considered to care and their families.
In 1990s, there was a big hunger in North Korea.
At the end of the end of North Korean of the heart of the heart of the heart of the open, and many more about it, because they're just because they're just because they're just outside.
Stromousands were always been hold, so that's been absolutely represent me all the light of China on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of China.
I always asked me, why she had light there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the rivers Amrocast <unk>, who's the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the flow of flows, and it's very simply northern North Koreaners.
But many stervive.
Sometimes I saw people in the rivers in the river.
I can't tell you how I can't finally tell you that I can say that I can say that I've been able to defend the hunger of the hunger of China.
I thought I was a short time of my family of my family.
I would never have thought that it was 14 years together together.
In China was very difficult to live as young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be a northern Acorean flying, but I would be extremely extremely extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous, but also very dangerous. Becored, because of I'm going to be seen in China.
So I lived in strong, I could have my life in after Identity, and you would have a bit of a bit of sending up in a bit of North Korea.
One day, my bigger alptraum was true when I was found from Chinese police and in the police and in the police of the police.
Someone is important to be a north Korean, so they did my Chinese, so they test my Chinese and they asked me to tell me.
I had this idea of my heart, I thought, I thought,
Well, for anything else, I could be appear, I could be else, and I could be each other.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I'm subjects, I'm sort of my feelings and remained the questions.
After they were finished with the example, said, "That was a false, he was a research.
It's not North Korean."
And they just walked me. It was a wonderful.
Some North Korean, you're going to look at China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had great happiness.
Although they were expected, they were finally finally finally free international pressure international pressure.
This North Koreanerins didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, unfortunately, in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be followed, elsewhilet or opened or public.
Although I had been lucky, I had a lot of other northern North Korean,
It's tragic that North Korean, their identity and hard to survival.
After they've learned a new language and worked their world in a moment on a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the most decided to go to South Korea, and I started to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
Mich in Southkorea, it was a bigger house, a greater challenge, when I thought it was thought it.
English was so important that I had to learned that I had to learned my third language.
And I've got the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all core, but inside, we've been very common inside, we've been very expanded by 67 years of part of 67 years of part of the part of 67 years.
I'm fly through a identity.
Bin I'm South or North Korean?
Where I come from? Who am I?
Plike, there was no lander, that my home, my home.
Although I was the adaptation of the south Korean life, I had a plan.
I'm asked to the attention of the university.
And I think, as I was able to be able to hide my new life, I was a bit of approach.
The North Korean body, the money, which I was sending my family, and when I was sended my family between my family between place on the country.
They had to fly as possible, so I started to plan.
North Koreaner, a unbelievable stream to their way back to their way.
It's almost impossible to consume between North Korea and South Korea, Ironically to China and I was took airplan garden.
Because my family didn't have to live them, I had to live them more than 2,000 miles through China and then after South Asia.
The business is a week, and we've been almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost.
One time, when the bus on the bus on the business, a Chinese police.
He took the except of all the ways and started questions.
And my family doesn't understood, I thought she would be finished.
When the Chinese example, my family, I decided told him, and he said that they were trees, and I was trees, and I was since.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, he was happy.
We've got to read it to the laotic garren, but I had to have to broken all my money to bring the border of Laos.
But even after we had the boundaries of the boundaries, my family inhaft, Illegal garrency.
After I had money and shoots and shooted my family inside of a months of a months of a months, but course, my family in the mainstad of Losa.
This was one of the biggest running of my life.
I had all done to sleep my family to freece, and we were so close to the family, but my family was just family, just my family.
I went back and I went back and the police and the police and the policeistation, and tried to family, but I hadn't enough money, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money.
I'm lost all my hope.
And then I asked me the voice of a man, "What's los?"
I was completely surprised that a friend of it.
In broken English and with a wordship and I was able to get my situation and without a bank, and without a bankomat, and two northern North Korean, and two family and two northern North Korean,
I thanked him from whole heart and asked him, "Why help me?"
"I'm not help you," he was telling you.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The most of the most community of frembolized for me to a new hope for me to a new hope, and he showed me the North Korean, and he showed me the friends and the entrepreneurs of fully as the community of the community of the Northern Corthern Amerconomy.
Finally, after our long rise, my family, my family and I remained family, but the freedom.
Many North Korean, they're done by their families, and soon as they're in a new country, they're not a guy or not a money or not a money.
The international community can help us help us to help us to help us to help us, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of us, because many of us have still remaining with families, and we're going to change them information and generation, the money, North Korea, North Korea.
I had a happiness, so much helpful and inspiration inspiration in my life, I hopeful northern North Koreanians, with international success.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful North Korean, also see on the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've just a bit of a bit.
I'm not saying that I'm not a normal.
I want to imagine my breast.
Remi is 22, big and very well.
He can't talk about, but he can't talk about a way that it couldn't have a sort of the best reder.
Remi know what love is love.
He's part of it, and he expensive, and he shared.
He's not just approach. He doesn't go on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences and imagine, you're not just before, he's never tell you a light.
If he singingled out of our childhood, and I'm not even remember the words that I remember one thing: how little bit about the consumer that we need to know about the unknown and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16th. He's very good. It's very good.
He's absolutely unfortable memory.
But he's also a since.
He can't remember if he remember my shocolate, but he remember the public, but he remembered by every long-pod, conversation that we had been fourth as four, as he was fouring on my phone's fourth of the television of my phone.
Don't you're not incredibly?
But many people don't stimate.
And in fact, because their understanding in the society of normal pastic various values, they're often wrong.
But what my heart was a similar and my soul, was that, although this was the case was that the case wasn't a similar to be a bit of a bit of appropriate that they were extraordinary -- extraordinary -- extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who don't trust asked to the terms of you who are a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain that communication, the social communications, and sometimes the large funkills.
It's like every individual in every individual, it's space as a sample of different than Sam.
And the world is going to be all 20 minutes in a new person Autism, and although it's a fastest growth, although it's a fastest growing environmental or healthy or healthy or healthy.
And I can't remember the first time I remember when I'm not remember, but I can't remember it.
I was born three years old, when my brother was born, and I was so on, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months, he was different.
He wrote a lot of it.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and actually he wasn't really interested in my fact,
Remi, and regarded in his own world, with his own rules, and he found out of your own rules, like a cars, like autos in a series of a series in a series of what it was going on.
And when he was older, he was different, and the differences were smaller.
But back the wood and the wood and the frust and the frustrial hyperactivity was something really a really unique: a very unique, a junning natures, a boy who had never been a human, who had never been a human, who had never been able took.
At the extraordinary.
Now, I can't live that there was some of the moments in my family moments in my family, moments I wished that they were exactly how I wish I would be exactly how I would be exactly how I would be exactly.
But I'm going to go back to the thoughts that they've leave me to have individuality, communication and love me that this is that these things I'm not going to be normality, and I don't want to tell you that this is not going to tell you.
Normality about the beauty that beauty that we're given us, and the fact that we're different, that we're not that one of us, it's a wrong.
It means that there's a different kind of rather than responsible.
And if I just a thing to say, and I could say to Sam and then you wouldn't be normal.
You're extraordinary.
Because, Autistic or not, the differences that we have a story, and we have a story of us, and in all of us, and in all of us, and in all of us, the ultimate opening opening opened by potential.
The chance on size, the research and wall and walls in the moment that we try to be trying to be different.
Bitte -- you're not saying that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Docccurred has a leadership and neuriosity, with this photo on a projectil, and with a projectility and with a million second, and with a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, we're not going to see the world with a million or a billion or a billion billion billion billion pictures per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography that femotography, a new education that's so fast, that it's so fast, that they can make time in movement in movement.
And so we can build cameras, we can build the absolutely buildings or without a beautiful or without a beautiful body in our body, and really in question, which we can ask myself, which is myself with "Kamera"
If I'm going to take a laser and a millionth and him in a million seconds -- that's more femtose -- that's more femtoseconds -- that's a packet of photones, and this is a millimeter, and this project, and this project.
So if you take this project, this photones, this photones and it in these flows, and it's going to be breaking these photones in the flashion?
How does it look like light in time?
So this whole events --
So think about it, the whole events are actually less than a nanosecond less than a nanosecond -- so light, so light, so light, but I needed to return this video to the factor 10 billion of these video to the factor of 10 billion billion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financialized.
So, in this movie, so let me show you what're going to show you what's going on.
The puls, our projectil, our project, trying to a photonpaketonpaket, which is starting to move and the finally inside.
A part of the light, you're going to see this table and you see these expensive.
Many of the photones are reaching the potones of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers and exploding in different directions.
As you can see, there's air, there's air, which is in the flash.
While the waves are reflecting on the table and while the reflexions of the rainflexions of the reflexions of the focuss on the end of the focuss.
If you take a subject, and you take this same stream and it's the same street and the video back to 10 billion, and the video, you know how long you're going to see how long you have to see here?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long movie -- from a long film -- from a long-term, normal projection.
And how does it look like a still billlebratography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, the table and the walls in the background.
It's like when you put a sentence in a text.
I'm going to make it as a photo moto males, the nature, yeah, yes, but of course, of course, of course, but of course, of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you will see that if you'll see that if the lights the lights, that if the lights, you're going to be done. They're not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and that's the light in their light, and after a million seconds.
So in future when these future, if these femto-Kamera in your camera, it could be possible, it could be able to make a supermarket, if you can see if you're talking about it, without touching it's not going to be able to build a free.
So how did my team at MIT these camera?
So as photographer, if you know, you're a photo with course, you've got very little light, but we've got a billion light, but we're going to get a billion times as your citizens, so well, so well, so well, so well.
So we're doing this: We're going to do this projectil, this photones, and show you this photones, and then you're going to repeating this gigabytes of data, and we've combinate this female to show you that female to show you the female bottom.
And we can take all these roohdates and doing very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hells can make us feel like, but how would it be with a new supercraft for a new superful surgery?
The idea is that we're going to street on the door.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it will be reflecting back to the door, and then we could reflect the camera and we could use these more simplicated by the light.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built.
Link of our femto-Kamera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we'll be able to put the door.
After our attention in the Nature Communication, and it was published by nature.communication.communication.communication.
We'll get these light-projects and they'll be able to help them in these walls and they're going to be able to all the directions and some of the photones, and then we'll be able to get the light, and then the light will be able to reproduce the trees.
And because we have a camera, the so fast is our faster -- our femto-Kamera has a single capacity.
She has a very good time, and she can look at the world in Light, and it can look at the world.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the most objects, but we don't know what we don't know what the point of the point.
So, in the smaller on the small, we can see a rooh-Bilding, and we can see it on the screen -- not really sense of these images, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they're trying together and try together, and they're going to try to try to try to try to tr
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We can see a little bit of doing this, we can see the lab, and we can build the practice, we can build the collisions that can build the collisions and see what's going to be able to see what we can do is going to look at the survey.
But because of the blood and the tissue is very figured out very, very, very, very, very hard to scientists, so that's really a way to think about female photography female picture of the next generation of medicine.
So, as we can't have a scientists, even a scientist, and we can't have a art, a art, a art, and I was a clear photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes that we don't know anything that we don't know anything.
But it's also happening here.
If you look at these waves under the rivers of the rivers, you see that the waves of us.
The waves should be moving towards.
What happens here?
It turns out that we're almost in light, because we've almost in light, and astein's affective effects of this image incredibly walked this image.
The reflection that happened in the world, in the world, he seems in the world, in the camera in the camera in the camera, so you can decide the relationships and time we can create these consumeration.
So, if we should be able to show you that we should be able to create the education of a new dangerous data or new data, we've allowed us to have data, we all have datails on our website and datails.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of opportunities, how our lives can improve our lives.
We don't make any nights on the street, so many ways of wisdoms don't have a lot of way. But we use this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and share things like apples and create things like aircle, shablones and circlones.
The projects of my questions, how much maybe my questions, how much maybe my neighbors?
How can we stop more things without us, without us?
How can we share our memory of memory and teaching the country and the country?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so our communities, our communities and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My selection will be remained by the hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of years, beds and dreams, and trees lowered shadows, I've been abused in the music.
I think every time, every time, every time you never have anyone, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city with most of the city of the city in America.
I'm where I can tell this house and I've been able to do it. There's a beautiful. It's what I thought about my life for always changed my life.
In 2009, I was a little bit of you, I loved very loved.
You're Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death.
I've been thinking about death, and I was a big disease for my life, and I brought me to my life, and it's important to me in life.
But it's hard to me, these sort of evidence every day.
It's easy to lose in the Alltaga and trying to understand what really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends of the old house of the old house in a huge tafelone with a shape of lucky, I want to be satter, "Bevor, I want to be a piece of the course of the piece of the piece,".
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could expect, but it was the next day, the wall completely completely completely.
I want to share some sentence with you who were written by the walls that were written.
"Bevor I want to be sterve, I want to be pirattern."
"Bevor I want to stervey, I want to stand over the International datums."
"Bevor I want to singing, I want to singing for millions."
"Bevor I want to sterve a bacter."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "nettle."
"Bevor I want to sterve them once I want them to half."
"Bevor I want to be sterve, I want someone."
"Bevor I want to be stervey, I'd be myself."
This is afterward place, and this was a sense of place, and the hope and the hope and dreams of people needed me to wine and translated me, and translated me while the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not all.
It's about our neighbors and understanding and second to a new and in a new way and way.
It's about it, place for best and to remembers and to remember what we think about what we growth, as we grow up and growth, as we growth and change us.
I've done this last year, and I've done this last year, and I've got a wallowered with their community, and I wanted to build a wall and I've got a building and now have been able to build a basically in the world, like Kasica, South Africa, South Africa, A
We've been used to share how much public public public public public public voices.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever before the things with the right blending blends and think that life is to think that life is currently.
We're often going to talk about death, about death or even thought about death or just thinking about it, but I realized that the benefits that the death is one of the death is the most stronger.
The thought about deaths of deaths us.
Our common pollinates on the best popularly what we can do as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities, and we can help us to share our hope and help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us better places.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with a mathematics. A particular problem for every problem for everyone who are considered to each other, is that we're going to be as companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you today today, to tell you what I do.
Tancing is one of the most activities.
We're eventually returned from most of most of most of most familiar ballettle, like you see how you see the same.
At the ballets are a very extraordinary big massive and abilities and abilities, and possibilities, and possible events that could have a genetic completely.
Traigeratories, neurological stories like Parkinson long-termost these extraordinary footprints. That's what I do was doing Jan Stripling Jan Stripling, who was a ballettuitude.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the mistake.
In fact, there's a worldwide 63 million people who live in this disease, and they have to live with the unexpected symptoms like symptoms, symptoms, and other people live in the disease that disease, we need to need to have the disease that medicrop of disease.
We need to measure the research is that we can measure, and last possibility, really, if we can actually know if we have a projective market, if we've got a question that question.
<unk>rigger is that there's no motional and other movement, so you can't have a biomarker, so you can't just a biombs. That's 20 minutes, that's 20 minutes neurogenes.
You have to him in the clinics. It's very expensive, and that means, and that means that means that never will never be clinical studies.
But what if patients could do that patients could do this test?
That would be a hospital tour in the hospital. What if patients could make patients?
It wouldn't be a texture of hospital.
It costs <unk>100 percent of the neurological action in the neurological action.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods, with the method that we're trying to get together, because we're all, in a sense of Sun, Virtuosen, virtuosen.
Here's a video of vibrate vibrate vibrate.
And that's what happens in the healthy spreading, we can see as a stimul ballettledge, because we can build all these voices, because we have to build all these voices, if we have to build the game.
And as Ballet is exploration.
Think about how long a child, as long as a kid, until it.
And by the louds, we can make the female vibrate stimmlipping. And as the game game the game memorgane of Parkinsonon's also the voice of Parkinson.
On the other way that you can see a example of instance, you can see a small voices.
We're always seeing this symptoms.
To true, swface, switch.
The language will be suffer and it's a single example of what's a example of what's a example of it.
These expectations, the voice of the voice, sometimes, but with thigital microphones and presence of microphones and presential cells, combined with new laware, with new lights, and we can actually farming with news.
How can these tests with clinical medical mess? Well, they're not both of the neurologists.
They're infrastructure. The infrastructure is there.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly. It's not going to be the voice of experts.
So you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
They're very quickly, though, three seconds.
They're very billed and we know what that means.
If something extremely billed, you can also have a big mass.
This is amazing state with this.
We can reduce logistic translate for patients.
Patients don't have to leave in the clinics in clinics.
We can remember if we can relate the data.
We can get a massive massive massive for clinical studies and remaining a difference of the whole population of all the population of the whole population.
We've got the opportunity to look at Biomarkers for the disease, before it's before it's before it.
Today, we're doing the first step in these direction, we started the parkinson's settime-Initiative.
With Aculab and patients Like Meeech, we want a very high-forest numbers to create enough to provide enough to best exciting this stuff.
We have spent rooms that divided the divided a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, or without Parkinson, can be recorded to get a few center to a few center for a few center. I give you a few center of our goal issues in the eight hours of our goalth.
Thank you.
If you say, if you're going to say 10,000 people, you can say, who's healthy and who isn't it?
What are you going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patient is that the patient of the person, whether these person on parkinson's living in parkinson't. Okay.
Some people will not be able to create it.
But we slow a huge database, under different environments, which is interesting. These are important. These are important, because we're important to make these extraordinary markers, which are the real markins.
For the second, you know, you know, right?
It's much better.
My should be love -- I have to love him, because he's so fantastic worked on the mobile work -- now has been working about the mobil function works, which is what this projection works, and we're going to be 99 percent of the project.
And I call a conservation.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handy, people can make the test. Parkinson could do with parkinson could take their voice, so that their doctor of the doctor of the doctor of the disease of the disease.
Gove.
Thank you. Max Let me, my dames and gentlemen!
Thank you.
Here I live in Kenya in Kenyairobi Nairobi-National parks.
In the background, you see the kitchen of my father and the cows the nairobi-National park.
The Nairobi-National park is in the south is just in the southern. That means that the wildtireless of the parks of everyone.
The raught that the solution, the solution, and then they do this.
They killed our vieties.
This is one of our cows that was killed. I went to be hidden. I went up and it was great. It was a great boy. It was our only bully.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, believe that we're going together with our animals and the way we came from the himeland.
Some as a kids, I learned solve.
Our war war warriorans. They're carrying our stamm and our hearts. They're involved our hearts. They're in this problem.
and killed the solution.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a national park in Nairobi- National Parket.
In my stamm is a boy between six and new years, and new years ago, and it was also for the kitchen.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fewer. Lions for fire.
But then I realized that we could help us to help us to help us to see the solve the cows that cows.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to do it with a vogel.
I wanted to think that the solve, I thought, I was studying the cow.
But lions are very clearly clean animals.
They come up with the birds and go back again. Because they're going to go back and say, yes, and they say, yeah, yeah, yes, that's still there.
And they went to kill our vieties and killed our vieties.
One night, I watched the stall. I love with a fackle in the hand to him and that's not at the lions of the solution.
Let's solve the light, that's moving.
I had an idea.
Since as a little boy worked on my room, I was working on my room and nose to my roadio of my mother. Another Radio of my mother. Anyway. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took a old car, and I'm going to show you a motorrad. The motorrad. The left or left, whether you want to be right.
And I was besting told me a shalter, and I'm a slight and out of a single.
This is a little birne of a captain of a captain.
And then I built all of it.
The solar panels are the battery that battery, the battery strom in the direction of the rest of the rest of the rator.
And the recording less blind.
You see that the birth, because the birth, because of the solution.
And this is what it looks like for the solution when they come from.
The light blink and the solve and the solve that I was about the stall. There was the whole time in the bed time in the bed.
Thank you.
I've got this installed installed and since we didn't have a problems with solve.
And then our neighbors, our neighborhood.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had many of their animals and she was losted me if I asked her lights installed me if I could tell her the light.
And I said, "Yes."
If I'm installed the light. They can see the solution in the background.
Since I have seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good.
My idea is going to use in all cases, even for other radio, even for other radio, or Leoparden. The Lichters, the lights of farms of farms.
My experience, I'm going to be a stipending schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really excited international school, and I'm really excited to be in Cenia,
My new school engaged and helps up and helping capacity and air.
I even asked my friends with home and I've been able to common installed the light, where there are no, and I'm going to show the people how to use them.
A year I just a year ago, one year of the Savanne who was hidden of his father. I saw Fluge, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a sitch!"
And here I'm going to stand.
I thought with airplane, I was attacked for my first TEDTalk.
I'm a big, I'm going to be airplane and pilot. That's my great dream.
I've gotten lions of my own lions, but through my experience, I can talk to my father, and we can save the solution, and we can live without side, side of side, without the solve, without street.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language is that, I think that's very much.
You know, you know, you know, how long, it's a story like your story like your story.
So you've got this stipendium. Yes.
You work at other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list of the list?
My next experience, now I work on a electric caza. A electric dot. A electroza?
Yes, I know, electrical dots are already, but I want to have my own own.
You've got it, you're trying to try, not trying to get away, but I've been trying to get back up, but I got to get a sleep.
All of the beginning is hard. Richard Turere, you're something very special.
We're going to be in every steps, I'm going to be my friends.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm old enough, a camera in the hand, is photography my passion. But my passion. But today, but I want to share with you 15 my favorite, and no one of them.
There was no way to do any kind of Director, no stilists, no chance has been a picture. Not even the remote.
In order to be able to be most of the most completely from the tourists.
My story begins as I started a talking about a talk in New York was and my wife, and my wife, on my first built on my army, and we were at my army. We were at the 7th of the Eckey fiveth and 57th.
And so we were later, we were back in New York and so we decided to look at the same picture.
Now, you can see what you can see is going to go out.
When the third building of my daughter said, "Hey, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you're not going to New York and makes it a father to get the ritual.
And then we started to make selling tourists to make an image of us.
You know, it's remarkable, as universal the face is when you're talking about a completely fremely reached his camera.
Nobody has never seems told and fortunately, someone has never been done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these risks would change our lives.
This is a very hard today.
This is just after the 11th, after the 11th, and I had to explain what happens was happening on the day, so that there was a five-year-old it.
These images are much more than just a functional moment, or a particular rise.
They're also a way to reflectober of a week in the octobers and how we change our time and how we change our time, not only physical, but in all of us to reflect the year.
Because even though we're always doing our perspective of males, our perspective of miles, as they always seeing new miles, and as they see the life with their eyes, and how they see it looks like it.
These very intensive time that we spend with each other, which we've been able to do something that we've been able to expect.
Last, as a sudden, while we're talking about one of our rice, and suddenly they're suddenly as they showed them how they showed up on a red market, they're small children as little kids, they learned to love.
And she told me about her feelings that she had been able to feel like five-year-olds of these sort of exactly this sort of exactly this sort of approach.
She said they remember how to remember the heart of the breast, when she saw the first time she saw the first time.
And now she looked in New York, because they want to study because they want to study in New York.
