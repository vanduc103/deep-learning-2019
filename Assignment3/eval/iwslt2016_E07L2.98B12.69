When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clener of the clen.
My father was hearing on his little bit, women Radio the news of BBC.
He looked very happy, what was pretty unusual, because of it was pretty unusual, because of the next bright.
He rest: "The Taliban are found!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father, I did obviously, very happy.
"You can go to a right school school," he said.
I'm going to eat the morning.
A rough school.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I spent the girls, and I was box.
And so I realized that I five years, I five years long as a junk, and I started my older sister, who don't have anymore, and I wasn't going to go to a little bit of school.
So we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we couldn't take a different way, so that couldn't get a different way where we went to where we went to.
We were hidden our books in the left, so we would go out so that it looked like this.
We were involved in a house, over 100 girls in a small wall well.
In the winter was, but incredibly, but incredibly, it's incredibly incredibly.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the middle of the difference of the difference for a week, because the Taliban powerful for a week.
We were never been never, how much they knew about us.
Do they asked us?
Who do they knew where we know?
We had angry, but we wanted to school.
I had great happiness in a family in a family, in the education as important and turned out.
My grandfather was his time.
As approaches from a decided provinced province Afghanistan, his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- to school and became the father of his father.
My born mother, but it was teacher.
That's what they do.
Two years ago, she went to the ruhest of our house in school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this was the first in his family, who was a school picture of someone who's ever recovery.
For him, he was clear that his children would be a children, also his daughter, even threats of the Taliban, trotz of all risks.
He looked like a lot of greater Risk, his children don't look at school.
I know that I'm going to be in the years, I was such a fear of our lives, of our lives, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective.
I had good lust, I had to give me. But my father said, "Thter, you can hear me. You can hear me.
His money can be carbon. You can be done in war. You can be done.
But a thing is always going to be done, and what's going to be here, and even if we have to touch with our blood for your blood for your blood for your bubbles, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to still you still still?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I'm in a country that's been destroyed by war.
Less than 6 percent of my older women have a higher a higher than the second baby, and if my family, and if my family, and if my family for my school, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as stolice Absolventin of Middlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather, my grandfather who was understanded by his family because he was won't been to school, his greater to school, one of the first one of the first, who was the first one of the first thing that I was battled.
He doesn't just like my high school, but also with my high school, but I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the first woman.
My family believe me.
I have great dreams, but my family has a greater trees for me.
So I'm global bothers for 10x10, a global bottom of women for 10x10,
So I've been helped, SOLALA, and maybe some internative internat for girls in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country, a country for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the schools of my school with great earning all of them with great earning chances.
And to see how their parents and various for them, as well as well as I was, and I decided to me, and decided to me.
So as Ahmed. That's not really his name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my dad.
And I'm a months ago, and he was on the home, and he's been able to get the death of SOLA in their during the streets of the streets.
When he was at home, came to home, and a voice, and a voice, he would be falling him, he would be falling up to school, she would try to school.
And he said, "This is now when you want to tell you, but I'm not going to use my daughter on the future of my daughters and overcome older and overcome."
What Afghanistanistan, so I realized something that I realized that in the West, the west often, most of us, most of us, the success, the success, the success, and the father, the father, and the success is that its successful.
That shouldn't be a little bit of relative role in our success.
And they're half the people who are highly the ones that are possible for a lot of their turning future of their tests. But in a society like the instance of the Afghanistan is the uncertainty.
And the Taliban went to school, only hundreds of girls -- because it was illegal.
But today, everybody in Afghanistan, about three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how to change the changes.
I'm notice that the changes are not about daughters and reports of the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I look at the school, and their parents, and their parents who are set up for them to a lot of parents that they're going to make a lot of future and a lot of wall.
Afghanistan is for me to a country of hope and the uncomfortable possibilities, and it remember every day, and I remember the SOLALA.
I think they've got them big dreams.
Thank you very much.
All I do what I do is, also -- my life -- my life -- my life was done by the work in Africa than ever,
In 1971, I see 71, I see it, but it's not -- I've got in Sambia, Kenya, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria, Algeria, algae countries of technical countries.
I've worked for a Italian NRO, and every single project that we're going to stand up the legs,
I was doubt.
I thought, 21 years, we thought that we're good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we're doing everything we're doing.
Our first project, what my first project, "Ripples of "Ripples" inspired inspiring, a sambias, a sambias, like Noodbias.
We came to Italian Saatgut in South America, in this topics, which leads to Sambesi-Flussi-flian population. We live the analyzing talian talia and Zucini.
Of course, the answer has no interests of its own interesting, so we could do it for work, and sometimes they did.
We were amazing that there was so early an early tales.
But instead of course, why they said, "God, we just said, "God, we just say, "God!"
"Gerade is just a real time to return the people to return the sambias."
Of course, everything is wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice tomates. In Italy, they were so big, in Sambia so big,
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Sook, like simple country."
When the domata, and red, came over 200 nights about 200 nights, and I asked everything.
We said to the Sambiern: "Oh God, the nilpferred!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a landwaren."
"Why don't you told us that?" "I'm not going to ask us."
I thought we were so greated in Africa, but then I saw what the Africa, but then I saw what the Americancial changes that the Englands, which was doing what they did, I saw what they did, I was data, I was quite a project.
We felt the five to the nilprofer.
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainment that we don't know the university of African people.
They should be the book "Thead Aid" by Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambian economic economic economic scientists.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have the changes have the African continent 15 million euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has this money.
Let me just her book.
Let me of a African, what we've started.
We're important people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, like we're just two kinds of patriarchal. We're patriarchalic.
Because words are stucked by the latest "pater" which means "Vather" which means "Vather"
But they have two different means two different means.
Patriarchali: I'm a different culture, as if they were my children. "I love my children. "I love my children."
Patronizing: I'm treated everybody each other culture, they would be my dying my dyermin.
That's white people in Africa, people in Africa, Chef,
I was growing up when I was the book "Small I was a book of school," by school, he said, "Small," he said, if people don't want to help people to wanted to walk into Rhe.
This is the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is Respect.
Today, the morning of the heart of the conference, a stabet, a stabet, and asked, "Can you're going to imagine a city, you don't think that't neocolonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react on humans, and he's going to react a system called company, which is never going to be something initiately, no one of the time you will never be the distributed to the distribution of the possible of the position,
What you do -- you're doing -- you're going to do.
You never never get a community with ideas, you're going together with the sky.
We don't work from broad.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We do it in Cneipen.
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally foundations and find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can make someone else a idea.
If these person don't like this person?
The passion for the passion for the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the real growth is the most important thing.
We help them to find the knowledge, because no one can be anything can be allowed.
The person with the idea hasn't have the knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this one: Why, why do you want to tell them what they should do, and people should do, why don't wearing them? But not in community.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
Internal remained, and they're never been public, which they're never going to tell their money, what they want to see.
Planation has this blind flex.
The clearly people who knows the community of community because they never know, because they never seem to make it affect.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, to do this social infrastructure, which is not existed.
A new box is created.
This is the house of the companies of the business of the bedroom, who are in your house, at your head, and in the caf<unk> sitting you're going to find your lifetime to find your lifestyle to find your lives.
I have this in It's trying to try to try to try.
I promoved to the time and trying to get the time and trying to decide what they should do, what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had only found in the first three days, and I had three days. I him. I him. He was half him. I was a garage, he was Maori. I him to make a restaurant in Perthers.
I half this fish fish fishers and this wonderful three-fished three-fished to a fabric in Albany for 60 cents, but for 15 dollars for 15 dollars for 15 dollars."
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government, and the government, "How do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I half the mouth and highly high."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Make it."
We've done it in 300 community.
We've been doing 40,000 companies.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go to a new generation.
Peter Drucker, one of the best companies of the story, story, starting a few years ago.
Peter Drucker was Philosophyprofessor, before he was recovered with company, Peter said, Peter said, Peter said, "Peter's really unprecomfortable and economic society."
Planation is the death of the entrepreneurs of the company.
So you built christches to know what the course of human course, with their money and their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this together.
You have to give them direction and privacy, and Privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
For the presentation of the presentation, you've got today?
<unk>rible, embracted people. The eating you've got out.
I want to say that companies to say that companies is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nicherbare fossil fossil fuels, fuels, and suddenly, there are systems that are not systems.
The confusion of the future is not sustainable.
The Freon-Aron-Aron is not so hard.
We need to look at how we have to look at millions of people on half after people, today, transportation, transportation and with them, they can corresponding them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will revolution for the green revolution? Universities? Universities? Do you're you?
The government? Do you're you."
It's going to be create. And they're going to do it.
I read a future story in a future in a future of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were egelade, took the future of New York in the city of New York in 1860.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happened in 100 years with the city of New York, the shelful, the city was a city: The Stadt New York City wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? You saw the curve and said, if the population in this tempoint in this tempoint in this tempox million pounds to be six millions of people who are unusprected to be in the mind, and it would be impossible to be able to be figure out of millions of six millions
Because they went down in the mistake.
1860, they see the bad technology that life looks like New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there was 1001, there was 1001 Automobilher -- 1001.
The idea that one other technology to find a different technology, the running little fabrics in the back of the background.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with companies.
And when he had to be able to tell them.
In fact, they don't talk about you and talk to you.
And when you have to tell them them, you have to turn them out, and empowerful service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth,
From the smallest company to be able to sell all in the lage, three things out of the line: The product, the product of his production, the consumption, and his financial production, and his financial.
Rates?
We never had a single person who are doing something that can produce something produce something produce, and it can care about the money.
That's not existed.
This person was never been born.
We've been looking at the research and the 100 iconic firms of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Fordon, Fordon, Fordinary, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed all the successful companies have been a: No, just one: No, just one person was a person.
Now, we're going to leave 16-year-old businesses, and we started to start the first two side of Richard Bransons Autobiography Bransons Autobiography, and the first one of the 16-year-old branch.
No one time, and 32 mal "wir"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody green a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we create a community, in the average that you need a little bit of Hinterground, in Caf<unk>s and Bars and Bars and Bars. You're going to do what someone is going to do for this game.
What can you make it? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you're going to take it on the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Mo you know that I'm going to finish?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of freedoms that can be undergrounded by the companies, and we're going to help them findows and people have found that the wonderful economy of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economic economics and the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be true, alice in the wonderful.
The penn State University, I was a Dozentin for communication -- at the communication -- at the communications in communications.
I had angry --
Rightly afraid. After this students with their big brains and their big big big books and their big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big b
But as the conversation of the conversation, he went to me as Alice as Alice, when she looked at the cannins and a door to a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I was asked to talk about the students. I was first. I was first about the thought that they had thought that other wanted to be the other wonderful.
I think that takes to open this door, it means it's great communication.
We need to change inevitable communication of our scientists and engineers and engineering the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are thejects that our greatest problems, like, to example, energy, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and I don't think it's not going to believe that weight as a responsibility.
But these great conversation, if our scientists, if our scientists and engineers and in their wonderful.
So scientists and engineers, bits, clearly clear.
I want to show you a few ants of how to show you that we can see that we can see that the science and technology, and the technology, with their technology, sexy and spaneous.
The first question that you have to answer, and?
Say, why was just a serious scientific are so relevant for us.
Say not only that their drawings are different structure, but they say that their drawing us that their drawings that their drawing structure in our bone, because they can understand the operatorosope and understanding.
And if you're going to do what you do is, then you're going to be distributed.
Father than a hinders are a hindow,
If you could use their equality and pretty and pretty much, but why don't you just say, "Ruma and time," and time, what is a lot of us?
Our thought that you're not going to make the same as their nive same as their nive.
How one mind, "Make," "Make the things like this, but not just like possible.
You can tell us something about eye, something about economic biasis, without a compromise, without compromise.
A few things are returning to be able to return: Because stories and analogies, and analogies, and analogies.
And if you're doing your work, then the stories, then the stories.
Habt you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stichpunct."
What happens when someone is that someone else? One, and with this point, and with these points, and with this point.
A following this is not just long, but it's also slowly too very long-term working on the language, and there's a lot of our brain.
These example of geneview of genes, it's much more we're going to show you that the special structure of the special structure of the trabekels so stability for the inspiration of the effective design.
The terrick here is a single simple simple sentence, and they use the audience, when it's audience, orient, orients can be orient, the failing and graphics, and the other senses of drawing your others and terms of distributed.
These are just a few ants that can help us to help us to see these door and the wonderful and the science and the technology and technology.
And the insight that I've been undergrounded me, I've been able to make me function with me, I want to make all of contact with a same with a same.
So, in fact, the science of economic stories, and education, teaching these relevants, so that's important, which is important, and multiplicated the Ganze of the people who are incredible for their own work, and it's unbelievement. And society.
So scientists and engineers, when you're going to be similar, clear me, I think it's unbed me.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy cancer a cell phone in Syria in Syria.
With a handy can tweet a message, and a protestail in <unk>gype.
And with a handy can take a long-term, it's highly high school and breaking.
All that's possible.
I've been in 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the time in this city.
There's a hundreds of thousands of people for changes on the streets and the constrated.
We are in the herful 1989, and we're going to be able to change the cell phone, a handy in the task.
Who in the Saal has a handy there?
Hald it.
Hald your handy high, you're high!
Hald it. One, a broid, a blackberry, which is a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everybody has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 350 cells of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.
This reline is called Rightliniety is called the record.
This reason is that every particularly in Europe, every telephone in Europe, every Internetdia, a bandbread Europe, a bandbread of bandbread.
Who do you know? Who do you know? Who's a email?
Who's a serious?
And if you're using a handy, where you're using.
All of these information will be six months to two years of your telephone to two years of your telephone or your Internetanby or your Internetanby.
And everywhere in Europeans, people are the people ones and said, "That's not."
They said, we wanted to these imagination.
We want to be self-bestimate self-digital time and we don't want to be that the telephone and Internetdia, and Internetdia,
There was appliate, Journalists, Preester, who said, "That's not going to do."
And here you can see how drawing people on the streets of blinds and said, "Freeth and said, "Freeth."
And some people said, this might be able to stasi 20.
The stasi was the secrets in Ostance.
And I asked me, whether it works really works.
Can you really know all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my telephone, I asked my telecom that was the greatest telephone, and I asked the greatest telephone, and I asked them, and I asked them all over my information that they're all sent me.
And I asked them to ask them, and she asked them, and they didn't get a right answer.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is protocolated.
So I decided to make a general diversity, they wanted to have this information because I wanted to have this information.
But the distribute telecom said, no, no, we will not give you.
At the end of it, it came to a same with them.
I'm going to go back to the future, where they all sorts of information.
Because in the twice of the boundaries of the boundation of the emotion of the E.U.
So I'm going to have this half of environmental environment with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35830 cells information.
First, I saw it, and he said, "I's half a huge date. Myetweet.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I start to start?
Because you see where I'm going to look at where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what I want to show you what is means.
So together with time Open Data City, so I've data City.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reinceooms and racooms, you can pull back and back to the back.
You can do every step, I can do that.
And you can see how I can see how I found from Frankfurt with the terms of five years, and how many anruggle.
All that's possible to this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just like, I call my wife, and we talked me, and we talk about a few mal with each other.
And then I went to me a few friends and they run a bit.
And after a while you and you're going to go and you've got this huge communicationnetwork.
But you can see how people can see people with each other, too lander, they're going to go to Bettle, they walked to Bettt.
You can see everything.
You know, you know, the central figures, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you can see a stuff, you can see what the society.
If you have to control the information, you can control the society.
This is a bauplan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect developed developed a society about how to do a society, because you know who's a great emailic, everything that's possible to this information.
And these information will be months for months, in Europe, in Europe to 2 years.
How I said, we asked to remember that all these people in the streets in the streets in 1989 Handys in her terask.
And the stasi, who had been wonstration of the Demonstration of the demonstration, who would have been won't have been going to be the leaders, that maybe this is never happened.
The case of the Berliner master might not states.
And also thought that the case of the ice.
Because today is state state and companies like so many information specifications, like they can wrote about us, online and often.
They want to be able to follow our lives, and they want to follow the whole thing.
But self-bestimate and a life in the digital time, not a video.
But everybody has to create for the self-day.
They have to fight every day.
So if you go home, you're going to go home, the privacy is a wertain of 21st century, and that this is not old, and that this is not old.
If you go home, you're going to go home, just because companies have the companies and state the possibility, the possibility of information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think you're asking your phone, you've been talking about you, they've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you remember your handy, you remember the self-bestime, you have to fight the same time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituosens, snellrestaurants, brestaurants.
So the city planets, and so the name South Central South Central Central, so it's something different, so it's changed him in South Los Angeles, which is something that's going to change what's going on.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituosens, snellrestaurants, brestaurants.
So like 26,5 million other Americans live in the food South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drival Los Angeles, and the Drive-by-bys.
The comic is that the Drive-thrus more people do than the Drive bys.
People are south Central Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The father is in my father is crate in my fourth, five males, five males, which is about 15 kills, which is about 15 kilometers.
I couldn't go to the more withans.
And I asked me how you would feel like you would feel like you wouldn't have a curious food if you'd have to go out of the house, if you look out of the negative expectations that has been able to see the best experience.
I'm going to buy the role of the role and selling as buying as building as building.
I see Dialysecialysecialyces like Starbucks.
And I started to stop that this is what it needs to hear.
I captured that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no latest, I had no latest on 45 minutes to get a pesticians to get a pesticians that is not with pesticians.
So I plant a food-work, I wald.
It's a piece of land that we call Parklage.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing that it's the city.
But you have to pay it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is because it's my responsibility and I have to half."
And I decided to hold it into stand.
So I came up and my groups that LA. Green reason, and we found my food, and we food, and we food, and others, soon, so the whole program, so the whole program, so the whole program, so that's the whole program.
We're a kind of imagination, and we're made out of genaries from all social signs and all the city, and it's free, and everything we're doing, and everything we do, is cost.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone else.
The city came to me and he was a practical practical a practical practice, and said that I had to be a richer to a richeral relading.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A richter food is approaches from food on a piece of food, that's trying to a piece of land,
And I thought, "Cool. Her so. Her so."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The LA. Times, Times, Steve Lopezz, and I did a story about it, and talked about the city and talking about a member of Green Breen Green Round. They were a petition of Change, and we were reached to change the chorgular.
We'd like to give you in the hands.
My city rather than even strategar and said that they're doing it.
So why would they do that?
LA. It's in the United States, most biggest states in the best of the city.
They're best 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough fly enough flying 725 million tomates.
Why didn't find it?
And by the approach of a plant, you're 1,000 sames.
With green Bohan in the wert of a dollars, you're own observation of 75 dollars.
It's my healthy, I say people should be able to build their own food.
His eating food is like his own money is like his own money.
Look, I have a conversation in South Central.
I went to you. I've got my sons. I have my sons.
And I remember, part of this imagined reality of the other people who were fabricians, and I fabricians, and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden is my graffiti. I plants my art.
Let's like a graffiti-course, the walls, the walls, I'm going to beautiful, I'm a roas and Parkla.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of piece, and the plants and the trees are my dreams for these hopes.
They would be surprised what the Earth, if you can use it as a legs.
You can't imagine how it's a sunlume is a sunlume is, and how people are leaders.
So what happened?
I've been experienced to a strument for the first time, and the construment of my fourth.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the box of the ground.
We're the box.
They would be wonderful as children are going to be conflict.
Garners is the therapeutical and coastic and coastic, especially with the city.
You know, you're going to get a superience.
I remember this time when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was circa, and I came out in my garden, and I came out.
I'm sorry, I'm sured because they were there, and I said, "Wis, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason for the street."
I went told me when I saw people looked at me, and I saw me, and I was just asked me, and that's just asked me, "Fin, you don't want to be fear, you're not going to be food."
And I said, "Thy teaching, no, I don't know what they're not afraid.
And it's not too line.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it back to the same time."
At the other time I lived a garden in this observation in Downtown LA.
These are the guy who are helped me to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how it was able to see how they're conflicting with her mother and how they've been used to see how it changed them, and it was great if they changed to see how they changed for a moment.
Green reason has been so basically done.
For our environmental works came so 50 people, and they're all free-free-willed.
If kids, if children, it children.
When they turned Tomates, they eat domata.
But if they don't get anything about it when they don't get the food, like food and body, how it's eating and body, they're eating them.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work, but they're going to stand in this thing -- I see, I see the exactly on the path, and the exactly on the path, and the next though they're going to go.
The Gargers, I see a message where we can train themselves, where we can train themselves to care their communities to lead after life.
And if we do that?
We could bring the next few George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Earth, we will never do that.
So this is one of my planet. That's what I want.
I want to share a whole we can share the garden plants where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a shipscontainer and they're using in health caf<unk>s.
So, don't understand me.
I'm not talking about costs, because it's not sustainable.
The comics of news is that you have to be able to do it.
I'm talking about people, people working to hold, and children from the streets, and they're going to leave the stolt and the eating and the eating, if you look at your own food, and if you look at the barmers.
So what I want to do here is the sexy.
I want to be that we all know that we're going to be mind, Gangster, Gangster.
We need to record the picture of Gangsters.
If you don't have a ganger.
Gangerous, you're going to go to the memory?
And let's the waffected the choice.
If you want to make meeting meeting meeting me, if you don't want to make you a meting and a meting and a meting, where you want to do something about it.
If you want to make meet meeting your garden, you can get to my garden, so we can use any sort of small small.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite books in the entire Oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No,"
Although in 19th century, a newspaper, a better diversity, "It's a better definition, someone who is someone who is someone who is an astrate, unable, programming or line, program or line, programs, and his power of power.
I have no idea what "spracheral."
Some of World, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all politicians that they need to contempt the language.
For 171, for example, the British Parlament, the British Parlament, time, not the exactly the debating.
And that was actually back to the mutes of a man's a man who was a man with the extraordinary names Brass Crosby, who was sure with the Parlament.
She was helped him in the Tower of London and he was a muthor, but he was mutig enough enough enough, and he was so much more unfortunately, and he was so much university in London, he won, he won, he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first news for the first neighborhood called "so strong as Brass.
Brassroom on the English word for Blech.
But that's not true. It's not going back to a return to a record.
But to show you how Worte, how Worte and politics, I want you to take you with the U.S., I want to take you to the Unability as they were just reached.
You saw the question of how to ask the George Washington, the state of Washington,
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a republic nation?
And it was in Congressed in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible proposital.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernor Washington, and other, other, and other, other side, and other botton, and other botton, and other people of the United States of America Washington.
Not so that's not a present.
Some people wanted to call him,
They thought that's been during.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king time.
It would have been working.
But everybody was unbelieved, because these distributed 3 weeks.
I have the day of a senator of a senator, the strong thing: "Immer the same is the same same thing.
The reason for the connection and the long time was that the representation was that the representation.
The representances didn't want to do that what doesn't want to do it. They didn't want to him.
Can you call them, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to bring them up.
They wanted told him the most painting, the most people who give them a game.
This guy was "President."
President. They didn't existed the title. He existed. But he didn't mean that someone else has a vamermation.
This is something like the prediction of a Jury.
He had no larger than the reason as the recording "Apasser" or "Apasser."
Sometimes, there were president smaller colonial community and governments, but it was really an incredible title.
So that's why the senat him.
They said, "That's longer, you can't call it President.
This cerles has to be able to write and from the citizens and from the citizens.
Who will take him, if he's going to take a dumbing small title like President of America?"
And also after 3 weeks, the sat on the sat.
Instead of the course, and you're not going to use the title of the course, but they wanted to create the color, they didn't know that they were not away from their own reportion today, and methods.
You can learn about three interesting things.
First -- and I think, I've been able to figure out if I don't find out if the satises, if the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title was only just about it. He was only about it.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something that's something that's something that you're also been 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important point, that's the most important point, the Titel President of America" of America, or not so the more than that, right?
This has been more than 5,000 nuclears to do something more than 5,000 nuclear volcancial volcial economy of the world and a photograph of the world and this whole currently.
And it's really a story, the title size of the title.
And so the senat at the end of the end.
They have a respectables title.
And the other sorge of the sense of the sense of illness -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to do all of these cerlings with the 5,000 nuclear spending five limits.
So the end of the senat and the representancesentances, because no one is going to feel the representation, if you feel the president of America is going to be the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take with, and I'm going to take me.
Politicians trying to use the reality to create the reality and reality to control the reality, but actually changes the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came in a laster with about 50 rebelled 50 rebelled dangerous dangerous, a 19-year-old, fireed by Jacksonville, Florida.
I'd thousands of my black converse Halby country, and I need a pair of landal and country in Raker, and we couldn't see a rocket that I couldn't see anything I couldn't even see anything.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
She was a long time, I was written with the war, everything, and everything, and footprints and football playing with the samsta and footprints with ristic southern Southern Asonic southern DNA.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to stand here, citizen Afghane, Southe Proletes God, atheist and a radical gradics, and a radical artists, the last new years in Afghanistan, and worked in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of things that we can do a lot about the art, but I couldn't make a personal magnifying art, I want to make art, and I want to make the personality and cars that are going to make authority and cars and recoversity and recording the new reality and reportsity.
I want to spend a day in life of a distributed -- Gangster, who's bringing the distribute of the Popstarling, and popular bubble and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's suns can do is doing the Dihad-Ganger than the Parlament and a choice and a choice with the Slogan: "What's a graduate."
And trying to use these campaigns to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosize the nationalhels.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and I'm going to take a project, and I called "Rield," which you're going to be a wrong control of cars, and a wrong controlss.
I want to look at me, like the conflict in Afghanistan of my mind, my mind,
The war and the war and the free-driving a new environment, have a new environment for style and models that you can only a model that you can only a model for soldiers and self-collectional and self-moothers, I cancer a marriage of the cell physically in the cell
And I would like to see how a simple cards to see a simple cabul between cards Appells to create approach today, today, today, today, today, and they need to create their waterials.
But for all these things can get in prison, they can get mission, they can be missed.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to lost the opposite of self.
This is my favor. Which is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since a time I worked as a model.
Second 10 years, right?
I have the feeling that now, this is a uncomfortable space, because I would have not look at this cleidement, because I wouldn't have to start this cleidement.
I've been lucky, I've got something to do something like this.
This is the first time that someone who's the first time to see someone on TED breast, so you can see, so happy to see that I think.
If you really have a few women really explored, when I got out to say that, I don't need to say that later, I'm going to say that later.
I also think that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very course, because I can change what you change you think about me.
And so that's not everybody has the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to cry them.
The most difficult part is to drawing the pullover about my head, because then you'll all look like me, you're nothing to do that, so long as long as a long as long as a long time.
In order.
Why did I do that?
That was personal.
Now, it wasn't hopefully like this picture.
One is a powerful, but a powerful.
I've just changed your minds of me in 6 seconds of me.
And on this picture -- I had never been never been a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photograph, I said, I'm solve my hand in the hand in the hand in the hair in the Haare of this guy.
And finally, from operations or the wrong bridge I wrong two days ago, there are two days of working for the work that is very few opportunities of our own question, and our own own lives -- although it's a bigger -- although our lives.
For example, to be hot today, today.
And I'm standing on this box because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this book because I know a house, because I know, and in my branch, and in my branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always ask me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means, but that means.
The real reason why I was a model, is a model in genetic lottery and maybe you're going to ask, and maybe you're going to ask.
Now, in the last few century, we have beauty, we don't just beautymetrically defined, and we're going to be biological programmed, but we're also finally programmed, but also hospital, and highly high.
This experience was created for me. And it's a number of me.
I know there are people in the audience that are skeptical. And maybe some models, and maybe some models, and maybe a few model. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Lui Wen. Lui Wen.
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to be a teacher.
But I've got to tell you that in 2007, a very at the year 2007, a very big debate of NYU all Models on the lunch of the nYU, every single, and that was booked by 767, and that was only two percent of the 27 or two percent of the productories.
The next question that I always been saying, "Can I went to be a model, if I'm going to grow up?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to give these little girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all be.
You can be presidentinent of the U.S. or the inventin of the next Internet, or a ninja-Herzirg-Herzin, which is to be irregal, because then you know, the first you know, because the first."
If they're still thinking about this great, "No, no, no, Cameron, I want to say, "Who," I say, "Whode my cameron."
Because I don't have a responsibility for the cowerful corner of American vogue or the business of Hamp; or the next surface of Hamp; Meisel.
To say that you're going to be a model, it's so that you want to say that sometimes you want to win the Jackpotto.
You can't reflect it, and it's almostic and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I'm going to be able to tell you about the other than heller, because it can only decided to be fold.
If you're going to be a photograph, and that's just like a nice, and the course, and the cameron, and the cameron, and then we want to go to the legs, and then you go to the legs, and that's going to go to the arm, and this poor, this poor, and this poor.
It's about this.
Hopefully comic than the middle.
That was .... I don't know what's happened.
If you're going to be a life and a life has done, and a few jobs, you can't do much more, you can't say that you're not going to say that you want to be a lot of the U.S., but in life, "10 years," you're going to go to the life."
The next question that I was often saying, "Who's all photos?
And yes, so pretty all photos will be retired, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is the most picture of photo, and that was also the most of the most fiction that I had a biciniode. I had no one biciniode.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I saw a few months took me to my grandmother.
This is what I'm at the day.
My friend must have to start me.
This is I'm on a Pyjama Party, a few days ago, a few days ago.
This is what I'm with the football team and in V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these images are not a pictures of me.
It's constructs and it's construction of a group of profis, from Hawylists and make-cournes and photograps and photograps and the stylists and the stylists and the non-production.
Okay, askay, when people ask me, "Cree, you know, "Creeksonst?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-cm-Abs, I can never met, but I can never met, but the things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to be in real life that I'm not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went to a day, and I went to a laden and I had my money. And you gave me the cleides for me.
When I went to my friends with my friends, a food food fluor, and they were talking about a red red launch of course, we needed to be a redote, and it was a "It's going to farmers," and we could far more.
I have this costs of my cost things, and I don't get my personality and not because of my personality and there are people who are people who are not a high personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were filmed in the last year, and filmed, 85 percent of the latinos and most of the men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men and Latinos, and Latinos, "Who, I'm going to ask you to ask me?"
So, "How often I'm going to look at? When I'm going to look at?
In my recher, I found that talked about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the U.S. And these numbers, and these numbers are 17 percent when they're 17 percent when they're 17 percent.
The last question is, "How is it, "How is to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting these answer: "If you're a little bit of distinner and glense, you feel, you feel very happy and fabulous and fabulous and fabulous.
And Backstage, we're going to give this eventually, maybe this eindruck.
We say, "It's really great, so much too much, and it's greative, with creative people, living inspiring people."
And everything is true, but it's just the half of the story, because what we never never before the camera, which I never said, "I feel like, "I feel like, "I feel like, "I feel like me."
And I feel like me, because I have to think every day, because I have to think about my exception.
And if you ask yourself, "What would I be happy if I was happy if I had done and believe?"
Then you should make a few models, because they have the thinst bone and the most community and the most global coolest coolest coolest coolest coolest cool, and they're the most female of the planet.
When I was noticed this talk, he was very difficult to me very difficult to me, a real bilanzing, because one of the felt, because I felt very uncomfortable, and I got very uncomfortable, and say, "I know everybody who was going to be a stuff. And I was going to believe me.
It was very difficult to be a very difficult, a result of unfortunately, and reasons, if I'm a bigger nutrients, if I'm a bigger of it.
But I'm also happy and felt like this, and I'm going to stand here, and I've been able to finish it, I've been here, or 20 or 30 years, or 30 years, and my career, and my career, because I wouldn't know, because I wouldn't know how I wouldn't know, I'm not going to tell meanted
If you look at this talk, if you're going to take all the power of the power of the power of the image and following the powerful success.
Thank you.
I've never for the words of my grandmother, which is never been coming in the exiling life, "Son, list of Gaddafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Worldafi Wid Wid.
But who never been never as a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the since of the liby research is inspiring inspires of the waves of the waves of the massive revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, inside and outside Libyens and outside Libyens to a day of the Zorns and to start a revolution of the tyrannic Regime Gadaffis.
And there was a great revolution.
Now, the boy women and men and men standing in the first range of the first rule of the regimes, highest slogans of the riversity, and social community in the air.
They've been taken mutes, by mutes by by turning the brutal Dictatur Gaddafis.
They have a strong sense for solidarity, from the farmers, from the farmers, until the south.
Finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 toted to start 50,000 toxes, our country and the tyrane and the Tyran.
But Gaddafi, every big big big big big big born, a big basically, the corruption and the reason for course.
Four year, Gaddafis Tyrannic Regime, the infrastructure, the infrastructure, as the moral structure of the lybical society.
The consciousness and the challenge, I asked, I as many other women, I as many other women who areas, the civil society, and we're going to look at a best and number of Democracy and national discocracy.
And so to 200 organizations were during and about 200 organizations, and about the case of Gaddazi, almost 300 in Benghazi.
After 33 years in Exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasm, I started workopshopshopshopshopshopshopshops and leaderships.
With a wonderful group of women, I women, I women, I women, a movement of women, a movement of women, leaders of women who are solution for the drawings of women's solution for women's solution.
And I met the payer I met on a very difficult environment, a currently polarized, a polarized by the egoistic politics of Dominan Politics and explained by Dominan.
I lived a population of peace and women who are women to make a women, to make a laws and women, a laws, a law, each brought to be a law, and told the rights and country, and to choose to country and country.
In the end of our initiative, our initiative.
Women women 17,5 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But long, but the eye everyone's the eye of choice and the whole revolution to <unk>n't growing up to new news.
And one morning, we're looking at the money of the money, and Sufi-Gral Mose.
In another morning, we've been thinking about the Mord at American bothers and the angript on the message.
And again, another morning the efficients were money.
And really, every day, we're going to look at the milize of the milize of the miles and their own victims and their facilities and their face.
Our society, created by a revolutionary colorization, polarized by the ideal and principles of the ideal and Principlete, social Gerek, social Gerek, social Gerek.
Intolerancial, explained and Rache, the Icones of the evolution of the revolution.
I'm not today today today with the success of our reverse, our reverse, and the numbers and the choice.
I'm going to talk today, I'm going to talk about a nation that we've been doing the wrong decisions and the wrong decisions.
We've been able told our priorities.
Because the choice writing writing writing or significants in Lybia.
Hat the rubber of rivers and the wheels and the white between female and men's female data?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why is going to continue our society and dominated by self-south of self-sheless politics of the dominance and the explane of men?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been female, but the female women's female of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensidered as they brought the choice, the number of the end of the end of the polarization and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative construction of the webs of the female, quantitative construction of the website.
We need to listen to the name of the corns and a day of the roach of the roach.
We need to start to start to make sense of the middle and the gnade.
We need to develop a female discovered that the following won't just going to be able to do this: Gnade, but also to work with a state, together, approach, approaching consciousness.
These are the ideal that ideal, which is a votely brought to reach freezing peace to reach free peace.
Because the peace has a alchemic and in this alchemics, it's about the feminal skulins and masculines.
This is the real reverse.
And we need to use existence, before we're doing it sociopolitical.
After a person from the Koran "Salam" -- Freeree-day, "The God,"
The word "raheads," and the abrahamic traditional trustomers, this is called Arabic Wurzel like the word "rahemic wonderful <unk> Mother<unk> and symbolized the whole female of humanity and the whole personality to the whole personality.
And just like the mother's the embryo, which is the most important thing that's next to the reason the reason the whole existence of the whole existence.
And so, that's been said, "My Gnade Gnade, all things."
And so, that's been said, "My Gnade has been a prepared."
And so many of us all the gunst of the gnade.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country, and I went to bring the lower, and I went to bring the low.
And I was very proud.
In school, we're going to see the story of Kim Il-Spect, but we learned about the world, there are no lot about the world, America, South Korea and Japanese are our female.
Although I was often asked me, asked me, I thought, I thought my whole life in North Korea, to a whole life in North Korea.
And so I saw years, I saw a public head, but I thought, I thought my life in North Korea's normal.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to live without hunger.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter a letter of a war, from the Swest.
Darin stand: "If you're going to be here, our five five families don't have anymore on this world, because we've been able to eat more than two weeks.
We're going together together and our bodies are so difficult to be soon."
I was so hocked.
I heard to hear the first time that people in my country.
I went to the board, I went to the box, and I saw something that I can't get more from my memory.
A live woman woman launch, and a abuse, and a fully child in their army.
But no one was half them because all of them, because all of them were so that they were to care and their families.
In 1990s, there was a great hunger in North Korea.
At the end of North Korean North Korean, and there were a million north, and many more far more about, and many more and many more and basis, because they're just because they're just a lot of them.
Stromousands were always been half after all the time, so that's been dunked me all the light of China on the other side of China on the other side of the Ufers,
I always asked me why she had there, and we didn't have.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the river of Amrocast <unk>, who's the border between North Korea and China,
How do you can see the river, the flowerful, and he's very simply northern North Koreaners.
But many stervive.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't tell you how North Korea, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I'm going to decided to China, after China.
I thought I was a briefly for a course of my family.
I would never thought that it was 14 years together together together.
In China, it was very hard to live as young girls without family.
I had no idea of how life would be like the life as northern Flinger flying his fly. But I would be extremely hard, but I'm not just extremely difficult, but also, because it's also finally dangerous.
So I lived in strong, I was able to fly in the world, and you would be able to fly into a bit of northal schicks.
One day, my bigger alptraum was true when I was found from Chinese police and in the Chinese police and in the police of the police.
Somebody each other, North Koreanerin, so they did my chinese chinese chinese and asked me to tell me, and I'm incredibly questions.
I had solided to me, I thought my heart would explodate my heart.
Would anything else, I could be approach, I could be eggged and absolutely.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I'm sleeping my life, my feelings and remained the questions.
After they were finished with the example, said, "The was a false," was a research.
It's not a North Korean."
And they love me. It was a wonder.
Some North Korean, you're looking at China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had great great girl.
Although they were expective, they were finally finally free-digrounded international pressure.
This North Koreanerins didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, unfortunately north Korean in China, and after North Korea, where they're followed, each other, or opened or public.
Although I had been lucky, I had lucky, it's a lot of other north Koreaners.
It's tragic that North Korean, their identity and hard to survival and hard to survival.
After they learned a new language and worked on the head, their world can be found their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the most decided to go to South Korea, and I've been a new life, and again, I started a new life.
Mich in South Korea, no one was a greater challenge, when I was thought it was done.
English was in South Korea so important that I had to learn to learn.
And I've been the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all core, but inside, we've been very commonly, we've been very expanded by 67 years of the part of 67 years of the part of 67 years.
I fly through a identity.
Bin I'm South or North Korean?
Where I come from? Who am I?
Plike, there was no land more, that my home, my home.
Although I was the fighting me the south Korean life, I had a plan.
I'm already for the attention of the university.
I was asked as I was going to be able to hide my new life, I would have a bad.
The north Korean body, the money, I found my family, and when I was sent to my family between my family between place.
They had to fly as possible, so I started to plan.
North Korean, a unbelievable stream to their way back to the freedom.
It's almost impossible to consume between North Korea, Ironically, Ironically to China and Ironically went back to China and made me back to China and I was going to take me to the northern Corean Grengthan Grence.
Because my family, I had to live them, I had to live them more than 2,000 miles through China and then after Southostasia.
The business is a week, and weeks, and we've been almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost fast.
At the bus once, when the business was a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the exhibiting of all, questions, questions.
And my family doesn't understood, I thought I thought she would be found.
When the Chinese example, my family, I decided told him, and he said that they would be decided to be a profession, and I was since.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, he was happy.
We're going to take it to the laotic garren, but I had took all my money to bring the border of Laos.
But even after we had the border of the border, my family inhaft, I illegal gorder.
After I had money and shooting and shooted my family, my family inside of a months of a months. But my family, my family in the mainstad of Losa.
This was one of the greatest running my life.
I had done everything to family to family to freece, and we were so close to the family, but my family was family, just my family.
I went back and I went to the increase and the police and the policeistation, and trying to family, but I hadn't enough money, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money.
I'm lost all my hope.
And so I asked me the voice of a man, "What's los?"
I was fully about it, that a friend that a friend.
In broken English and with a words and with a words, I went to situation and without a bankomat, and without a bankomat, and two northern and two northern North Korean, and two northern Northern Korean.
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why help me?"
"I'm not help you," he was.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The most frequent frembolized frembolized for me to a new hope that the North Koreaneran, and he showed me the freedom, and he showed me the freedom of free and the university of fuels.
Finally, after our long risk, my family, and I remained family, but the freezing is just a step.
Many North Korean, they're done by their families, and soon as they're going to start them in a new country or no money or no money.
The international community can help us help us to help us to help us, the English and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of us, because many of us have a lot of us in contact with families, and we're going to change them information and generation, the money, the money.
I had a happiness, so much helping and inspiration inspiration in my life, I hopeful North Korean North Korean North Korean United Stational company.
I'm sure you're a lot more successful North Korean North Korean, also on the world, also on the bage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I've just a bit of a bit.
I don't say you're not me that I'm normal.
I want to tell you my breast.
Remi is 22, big and very well.
He can't talk about, but he can't communicated freedom, like some of the best redning.
Remi white is what love is.
He's particularly expensive and expensive.
He's not just a big. He doesn't look at the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and imagine, and imagine, he's never been a light.
If he looked at our childhood, it's not even trying to the words, I remember that I remember one thing: how do we know about the constantly known as wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16th. He's very good. He's very good.
He's absolutely uncomfortable memory.
But he has a selective.
He can't remember if he remember my shocolate, but he remember that he remembers of every longer, and he remembers of every lower, conversation that we had four, as fourth, as four, as he was fouring on my arms.
Don't they don't be incredibly?
But a lot of people don't have a lot of people.
And in fact, because their constantly don't in the society of normal past, they're often, they're often, and they're often.
But what my heart was the heart and my soul, and my soul, whether this was that the case wasn't a case, although they were not a bit more than they were able to be a bigger -- they were extraordinary -- extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who don't use the people who don't use the reefully, it's a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, and sometimes the social communications.
It's approached in every individual, it's space, it's a different than Sam.
And the world is going to be all 20 minutes in a new person Autism, and although it's a fastest growth, and although it's a fastest choice or healthy or healthy or healthy or healthy.
And I can't remember the first time I remember when I remember autism, but I can't remember it.
I was born three years old, when my brother was born, and I was so on, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months was that he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and actually he didn't really interested in my fact,
Remi, and regarded in his own world, with his own world, with his own rules, and he found out of the smallest things like autos in a series in a series in a series of the room, which is what it was different, and everything it.
And when he was older, he was different and the differences were different.
But the woods and the wood and the frust and the frustrial hyperactivity was something really a really important thing: a very single natures: a boy, a junning national, a junning, a human, who had never been a human,
At the extraordinary.
Now, I can't live that there was some of the only moments in my family moments in my family, moments I wished that they would be exactly how I would be exactly how I would be exactly how I would be like.
But I'm going to go back to the thought they've leave me to the things that they've leave me, communication and love me that this is the same thing that I don't want to tell you that this is not going to challenge.
Normality about the beauty that beauty that difference, and the fact that we are different, and the fact that we're not mean that one of us are not that one of us.
It means that there's another kind of rather than the right.
And if I just a thing to say, and then I could say, and then you couldn't be normal, you wouldn't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, Autistic or not, the differences that we have a story! Everybody from us, and in everything has a strong, and in everything is the ultimate operative Opfers of potential Opfers of potential.
The chance on the scale, research, and walls in the moment, in the moment that we try to be different.
I don't say -- you're not me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doccccurred to us with edge and neurosed to the picture of this photo on the photo on the project, and with a million second, and with a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, and see the world, and see the world, but you can't see a million or a million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography that photography, a new education, a new education that they can sell, that they can make time.
And so we can build cameras, we can build the absolutely to look at the skills or without a beautiful body in our body, and really, and really, really, and really, what we can ask, "Camera."
If I'm going to take a laser and him in a million-stelful seconds -- that are more femtose -- that's more femtose -- that's a packet of Pakethoton, and this is a millimeter, and this project, and this project is going to be a miles.
So if you take this project, this photones, this photones and it in these flashes, how these photones are going to breaking?
How does it look like light in time?
So this whole eventually --
So think about it, the whole eventually determinally, less than a nanosecond -- so long than a nanosecond -- so light, and I needed to return this video to the fair of this video to 10 billion dollars.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financialized.
So, in this movie, so let me show you what're going to show you what happens.
The puls, our projectil, our project, in the fleashion with a photonpaket, which is a potonpaket, and that's breaking inside.
A part of the light, after the table, and you see these extremework.
Many of the photones are reaching the last last last last distribution and exploding the rivers.
How you can see, there's air, there's air that's in the flash.
While during the waves are going to look at the table and white of the reflexions of the reflexions of the reflexions of the focused on the end of the focused.
If you take a piece of project, and it's the same stream, and that video back to 10 billion billion, and the video, you know, how long you know, how long you're going to see here?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long movie -- from a long film -- from a long project, normal project,
And how does it look like still bills fotography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, the table and the wall in the background.
It's like if you're a sentence.
I'm going to be as if the nature as a photo males, the nature, the movie, but of course, of course, but of course, our eye.
But if you look at this tomate, you will see that if you'll see that if the lights the light, that if the lights, that's not going to be done.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and that's the light in their light and after a million seconds.
So in future, if this femto-Kamera in your camera in your camera, it could be possible, it could be able to make a supermarket, and fears, if you can see if you're talking about it.
So how did my teamera at MIT these camera?
So, as photographs know if you're a photo with course, you have a very little light, but we've got very little light, but we're going to make a billion times as your citizens, so you get so good as good as you can't get a light.
So we're doing this: We're going to do this project, this photones, and show you this photones, and show you this is very clever synchronization and reports of data, and we've been recording to show you this female to show you this female.
And we can take all these roohdates and so much interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can make us feel like, but how would it be a new surgery for a new superful surgery: to see ecknow?
The idea is that we're going to strangers.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it, a part of it will reflecting back to the door, and we could reflect the more simployees and we could use these more simploye.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built it even built.
Link of our femto-Kamera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we'll be able to leave the door.
After our attention in the "Nature Communication" was opened by Nature.communication.communication.coming these animation.coming them.
We're going to be able to get this light, and they're going to take this wall and they're going to be able to get in all the records, and some of the photones will be reached to the light, and then the light will reach the light, and then the light will return to the trees.
And because we have a camera, the so fast is -- our femto-Kamera has some single camera.
It's a very good time, and she can look at the world in Light, and it can look at the world.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point of the point.
So, we can see a laser on the leave, we can take a rooh-born, and how they're seeing on the screen -- not really sense of these images, but if we're going to try and make them collective, and they're trying together and try together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We can see a big, we can see the village of laboratory, and we can use the practice, we can build the collisions that can build the collision and recognize what we can do is dangerous, or we can look at the survey by the way weight of looking forms.
But because of the blood and the tissue is very figure out very, very, very hard to find out, which is why the really a way to think about scientists, now, now, now a new picture of scientists, because a new picture of medical education of medicine.
So, as we can do this, and we can't have a scientists, and we can have a scientists, a art, a art, a art, and I realized that all of these gigabytes, and I realized that all these gigabytes we know that everything economics.
But it's also happening here,
If you look at this waves under the rivers of rivers, you see that the waves of us.
The waves should be moving to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're almost in Light, because we've almost in Light, and astein's affective effects of this image, and one of the image.
The reflection, in the event in the world, he seems in the world, he seems in the camera in the camera, so you can decide the relationship of room and time, we can create these construction of space and time.
So, if we're going to show you that we should be able to create the education of a new dangerous confusion or new data, or new data, we've allowed us to create our food and datails, and we can do allow our website.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of our opportunities can be better life.
We don't do any night in the street, so many ways, so many ways, so many ways, but we're using this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and there are things like a type, schools and create circlones and create circle.
The projects of my questions, how much matters like many mixed my neighbors?
How can we stop more things, without us, without us?
How can we share our memory of memory, and the country and the country?
And how can we share our hope for living hands, so our community, our community and dreams and dreams and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My selection will be remained by the hundreds of years, the hundreds of years, and trees, beds and trees line, and trees line. I'm going to be a city, and I'm always a stady.
I think every time, every time you're never mean, there's no one parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city with most reasonable reasonable reason.
I'm where I can do this house and I've been thinking about how I can change it. There's a little bit of my life for always changed my life for always changed my life.
In 2009, I was a young people I loved very loved.
You're Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death.
I've been thinking about death, and I was a big disease for my life, and I brought me, and it brought me now, and I need to be important.
But it's hard to me, this sort of missing every day.
It's easy to lose in the Alltaga, and to eat what really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I wrote a side of the house of the house, and wrote with a shoot and wrote, "Bevor, I want to be a both of the piece of the piece of the course,"
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could experiment, but it was the next day, the wall completely completely and they're always further.
I want to share some sentence that were shared by the walls that were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to be sterved piratients."
"Bevor I want to stervorite about the International datums of International datums."
"Bevor I want to singing for millions."
"Bevor I want to sterve a baump.
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "nethen."
"Bevor I want to sterve them in my arms."
"Bevor I want to be stervallery."
"Bevor I want to be stervor, I want to be myself."
This is a laughter place, and this was a sense of place, and the hope and dreams of people needed me to wine and dreams, for the wine and translated me while the hard time.
It's about knowing that you don't know anything.
It's about our neighborhood and second, and it's a new and on a new way.
It's about it, place for best and to remembers and to remember what we think about, and what we think about us, while we growth and change us.
I've done this last year, and I've done a hundreds of living in the last year, and I wanted to build a wall, and I wanted to build a wall and I have a basket and now, and now, and now, and now, and now, in the world, like countries, and I've been able to building countr
We've been used to have our powerful public public public public public voices, and more with other people.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever, the things that are more important to think about the right blend and think that life is that life course, and empowerful.
We're often going to talk about death, about death, or just to think about the death, but I realized that the benefits that the death is one of the death is one of the death.
The thought about the death of death.
Our common painting the best painting what we can do as individuals and as a community, and more important. And with more opportunities, and more important and stories can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with a mathematics. A special problem for every problem for every problem for everybody who are decided to each other, is that we are like companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you today today, to explain what I do.
Tances is one of the most human activities.
We're decided to be approached by most of most founds and sweetting and sweetting, like you see.
For Balletting is a very extraordinary massive markets and abilities, and abilities, and possible eventually, and possible eventually have a genetic completely.
Traigerly, destroying newurological stories like Parkinson, this extraordinary footprints. That's what I do is, and that makes me to be a ballettuose.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the mistakes.
In fact, there's a worldwide 63 million people who are living in this disease, and they have to live with the unbelievable symptoms like symptoms, such as a symptoms, and more live in the disease that we need to need to do is whether we need to need to be able to doing the dise
We need to eat the research is whether we can measure, and last possibility, really, whether there's a projective market, if we have a projective market.
<unk>rigger is that there's a parkinson and other movement, so you can't have a biomarker, so you can't just a biombs. The best thing is that 20 minutes of neurogenes.
You have to him in the clinics. It's very expensive, and that means, and that means that means that never will never be the never.
But what if patients could do this test to do this test?
That would be a decided to be a hospital in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't be a teaching hospital.
It costs 300 percent of 300 percent of the neurological approaches.
So I want to tell you a unconventional method, with the method, with the reaching that we're all trying to reach out, because we're all senses like my read, virtuote, virtuote.
Here you see a video of video of vibrate stimmlipping.
And that's happened in the health country, if someone can see us as a stimul ballettle, because we can look at all these stimorgane, because we have to build all these stimorganizing, and we have to build the game.
And as ballets it enormously enormous.
Think about how long a child, like long, until it to talk about it.
And so we can see the position of the fibrate stimmlipping vibrate, and as the Gliedma are also the vibratorgane of Parkinsonon's done.
And the other recording to the undergular voice for inequalent voice.
We see this same symptoms.
Toice, swful, switch.
The language will be suffering and it's a bit of time, and that's an example of it.
These expectations, the voice, sometimes you can be minimal microfones, but with digital microfones and prison, combined with new laware, combined with new laware, and we can actually create with news, and we can do that.
How can you look at this tests with clinical medical message? Well, they're not a report.
In fact, the infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly. There's not going to be the voice of experts.
So you can be able to be able to be able to be.
They're very quickly, though, three seconds.
They're very billed and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also be able to use it into big mass.
This is the first state of the reaches, we can now.
We can reduce logistic translate for patients.
Patients don't have to leave in the clinics in the clinics.
We can remarkable data through half-day relationship.
We can make serious massive massive massive studies and recording to clinical studies, and it's a difference of the whole population.
We've got the opportunity to look at Biomarkers for the disease, before it's before it.
Today, we're doing this right now, we started struggle, we started the parkinson's "Initiative.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high-hig number of voice, to make enough equality to produce enough to best enough this stuff.
We have rooms that are the divided to a billion people on this planet on this planet.
Everyone, or without Parkinson, can be done, to get a few center to a few center to a few center. I give you a few center of our goal process.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people, you can say, who can say, who's healthy, who isn't it?
What are you going to do with all these problem?
What happens is that the patient is that the patient of the person, whether this person on person, or not. Okay, or not. Okay. Okay.
Some people will not be able to create it.
But we slowly a huge database, under different environments, which is interesting. These environments, because we are important to make these out of the process that we're including the real markets.
For the time, you're doing their 86 percent genetic?
It's much better.
My school -- I have to love him, because he's so fantastic worked because he's so fantastic worked -- now it's also working about the mobil function works, which is what this projection is that projection, and we're going to do 9 percent.
And I call a better.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handy, people can do with Parkinson could do with Parkinson could take their voice, their voice, so that their doctor of the doctor of the doctor of the disease.
Gove.
Thank you. Max Let me, my dames and gentlemen!
Thank you.
Here I live. I live in Kenia at the southern Randi-National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the board is the Nairobi-National Park.
The Nairobi-National Park is in the southern in the southern. That means that the wildtire like the parks of each other,
The raught that the solution that solve them. And then they do this.
They killed our vieties.
This is one of our coast that was done. I went to be done. I went up and I went up. It was a great board. It was our only bull.
My stamm, the stamm of Massai, believed that we're going together with our animals and the way we came from the himself.
I learned to kids to eat.
Our war war war wars, you're going to protect our stamm and our hearts. They're also away from this problem. They're in this problem.
and killed the solution.
Here's one of six lions that were done in Nairobi,
And I think there's a nairobi- Nairobi- National Parket.
In my stamm is a boy between six and new years, and new years, it was also for the coast, so I went to me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fewing was Fewers. Live.
But then I realized that we would help us to help us to help us to help us to see the cows that can help us.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to look at a vogel.
I wanted to think that the solution I thought, I was struggle.
But lions are very clearly animals.
They're going to see the virgels and go back again. Because they're going to go and say, and say, "Well, that's not yeah, that's still there.
And they were taking up and killed our vieties.
One night, I watched the stall. I love with a fackle in the hand to him and this time, and that's not at the lions.
Let's solve the light, the light.
I had an idea.
Since as a little boy worked on my room, I was working on my room and nose to my roadio of my mother roadio of my mother. Another's fast. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took a old cars and autobattery and a representation of a motorrad. The left or left or left, whether you want to go down.
And I was besting a shalter, took the light and out of the light.
This is a little birne of a captain of a captain.
And then I built all of it.
The solar panels that the battery, the battery, the battery, I call it a transformation. I call it a transformator.
And the reason is less blind.
You see that the birth, the birth, because of the solution of the solution.
And so it looks like this for the solution when they come up.
The light blink and the light and the solve that I think I was about the stall. There was the whole time in the bed.
Thank you.
I have this installed to home installed and seen we didn't have a problems with solve.
And then our neighbors, our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals, and she asked me if I asked her lights me if I could found her light.
And I said, "Yes."
If I went to the light. They can see the solution in the background.
I've seven houses in the neighborhood, and they're really good at the lights, and they work.
My idea is going to be used in all cases, also for other raubtire like Hyave or Leoparden. The Lichters. The lights.
My experience, I'm sustainable to a stip of schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really excited.
My new school engaged, and helps up and helping approaching and relationship.
I've even my friends with home and I brought up and give them the light, and I'm going to show the light, and I'm going to show you how to use them.
A year I just a year ago, a year of Savanne, who was hidden of his vather. I saw fly over me and said, "I'm going to sitting in a sit.
And here I'm going to stand.
I was during with airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a big, I'm going to be airplane and pilot. That's my great dream.
I've gotten lions, I can go through my early, but through my father, I can talk to my father and the solution, and we can return the solve, side, without the solve, without side, without the solve.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language is that means that: I thank you very much.
You know, you know, you don't know how to hear it is a story like your story.
So you've got this stipending now. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next to the list?
My next experience, now I work on a electrical dotic ca. A electrical dot. A electroza?
Yes, I know, electrical dots are already, but I want to remember my own.
You've got to be trying to try to try, I'm trying to try and I'm trying to give you a book, but I got to give you a shoot.
All of the beginning is hard Turere, you're something very special bonderful.
We're going to be done in every single way, my friends, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm age enough, a camera in the hand, is photography my passion. But my passion. But I want to share with you today with you 15 my favorite.
There was no way to do this kind of director, no stilists, no chance a picture. Not even a picture. Not even the relationship.
In fact, most of his, most of them were made by the mostly decided to be founded by tourists.
My story begins as I started a talking about a talk in New York was and my wife, and my wife, on my first building on my first building on my arm. We were at the first feet. We were at 57 and 57th.
And so we were later, we were back in New York and so we decided to look at the same picture.
Well, you can see that, you can see that.
When the third building my daughter said, "Hey, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you're not going to New York and makes it a father for the Ritual, to lead to father?"
And then we started to make selling tourists to make an image of us.
You know, it's remarkable, as universal the face is when you're talking about a virtually fremely reason.
Nobody has never been told and fortune, and fortune, someone has never been done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rises would change our lives.
This is a very hard today.
This is only one weeks after the 11st, and I had told the day, and I had told what happened was that a five-year-old, so that there can understand.
These images are much more than just a fear moment, or a particular received received received received.
They're also a way to us a week for a week in the october, and how we change our time and how we change our time, not only physical, but in everything in everything.
Because even though we're always doing our perspective of malth of mal. While they always see new miles, and as they're always seeing the life with their eyes, and how they see them.
These are very intensive time that we spend together, and every year we're going to have a little bit of free year.
Last, while we're talking about one of our rice, and we're talking about how they're suddenly reded to a red market, they showed up a red market, they'd learned as little kids, they love to love to love.
And she told me about their feeling me of their feelings that they had been doing this sort of exactly this sort of empathy.
She said they remember how to remember the heart of the breast, when she was a new years ago, when they saw the first time.
And now she looked in New York, because they want to study because they want to study in New York.
And I realized, I realized, the most important thing we all all created.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you, an active role in the most experience of memory.
I don't know how it looks like this, but it's going to look at this 15 images, I'm on a families.
I'm always the picture.
I want to start to tell you today with you today and cut your image, and you don't want to ask you, "Would you do a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
