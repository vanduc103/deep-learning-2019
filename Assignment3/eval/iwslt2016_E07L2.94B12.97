When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clenging crowd.
My father hearing on his little bit, women Radio the news of the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual, because of the neighborhood was the news.
He called "The Taliban are wrong!"
I didn't know what that means, but it made my father, I didn't really happy.
"You can go on a right school," he said, he said.
The morning I'm never been able to figure out.
All right school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was sixed, and they spent a girl, and they spent to school.
So I was sold, I five years long as a junning and started my older sister, my older sister, that's not going to go to a little school.
And so we could go to school to school.
Every day, we took a different way, even though, even nobody could never went to where we went to where we went.
We were hidden our books in the books in the income, so we could just look like this.
And we were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small wohnzimmer.
In the winter was incredibly, but in the summer was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
And then the remain, the bottom of the bottom of a week, because the taliban considered.
We were never sure how much they knew about us.
Do they recorded us?
Where are they know where we were?
We had angry, but we wanted to school.
I had lucky in a family to grow up in the education as important as important and taken.
My grandfather was his time.
One of a carbon from a devinced provinced Afghanistan. He was based on his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my father -- my father.
My brought mother, but became teachers.
That's what it is.
Two years ago, she went to the rhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here's the first thing in his family, who was ever a school painting a school.
For him was always clear that his children would be a children, also his children, also his daughter, deades the Taliban, trotzing every risk.
He looked like a much bigger Risko, his children don't look at school.
I know that I know that I'm sured in the years, sometimes, sometimes, from our lives, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective.
I had good loss to give me. But my father said, "The can lose my father, you can lose your life.
The money can be carbon can be done in war. You can be done in war.
But a thing that's always going to be there, and that's what's going on. And even if we're going to take our blood for your school for your school, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to still you still want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I'm in a country of war.
Less than 6 percent of my alters have a higher than the second as the second, and when my family. And if my family, and if my family, I would have a little bit of my school.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a stolved Abury College.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was my family was understood because he was a bad, because he was a bad to school, he was a greater to school.
He doesn't just talk to my high school, but also too, but also I was the first woman, and I was the first woman who was free.
My family believed.
I have big dreams, but my family has larger animals for me.
So I'm a global both of global both of the world's world for 1010, a global campaign for the education of women.
So I've got to go to the SOLA to green, and maybe some internative internator for mice in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country, a country.
It's wonderful to see how the students of my school with great earned with great earness, all of them.
And to see how their parents and varter for them, and variously my parents for me, and I decided to me, and then everything.
So as Ahmed. That's not his name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
And a month ago, his daughter and he's on the home of SOLA in their village, and they're the death, and they're just about a few minutes.
When he was home, he came to home the phone and a voice, and a voice, he would be able to school, he would try to school.
And he said, "The said, "The I want to say, but I'm not going to be the future of my daughter on the future of my daughters."
What Afghanistan, I realized something that I realized something that's going to be able to do is, the most often, the excused by us, the success, the success, and the walls that he's successful, and the expects.
That's not today that our mothers don't know what we're playing in our success.
These are the people who are harmers who are harming and talking about a lot of possible for a lot of powerful to their treatment. But in a society like the infghanistan is the infinite mence of the men's unexpected.
On the Taliban went to school, just a few hundred girls -- because it was illegal.
But today, everyone in Afghanistan about three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America,
The Americans are recognize how we're doing this.
I'm notice that the change of daughters are not changing the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I'm the school, and their parents in my school, and their parents that they're going to take a lot of parents that they're going to make a lot of future and a lot of walls.
Afghanistan is for me to a country of hope and the uncomfortable opportunities, and it remember every day.
And as I've got big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, I've been created by the work -- my life in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1971 to 197 -- I'm looking at it -- I'm in Sambia, Kenya, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria, Algeria, Algeria, and Somalia, with African countries.
I worked for a half a half a single project that we've been on the legs that we're on the legs.
I was set up.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people are good working in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we've done everything we started.
Our first project, what my first project, which is my first book "Ripples inspiring," inspiring a, one that we wanted to show you how nambias, like nutrition.
We came with Italian Saatgut in South America, in this to South Bia, which is the Sambia, which is leading to Sambesi flying the animical population of the animals and Tomata and Tomata and Zucini.
Of course, the answer was not an interest insects, so we could pay attention to work for the work, and sometimes they're also doing it.
We were amazing that there was no landable tales in a so early talue.
But instead of asking why they didn't look at why they said, "God's simply saying, "God."
"Govery," to return the people to save the people to return the prediction."
Of course, all wonderful in Africa.
We had these practice tomates. In Italy, they were so big, in Sambia so big.
We couldn't believe it and said, "Shouse, like skin, like simple country."
When the tomata, and red, came out of 200 night, about 200 night, and they asked everything.
We said to the Sambian: "Oh God, the Nilpferde!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a country here."
"Why didn't say, "I'm not saying, "You've never asked us."
I thought, we were so greater in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, I saw what the Americans made what the Englands, which was doing what they did was doing. After I saw what she was doing was pretty strong in our project.
We felt the nilks to the nilproduce.
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainly, we don't look at the beginning African people.
They should be the book "Thead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambic economy.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have the countries have been given the African continent 1.5 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been telling you what this money.
Let's just give her book.
Les you know about a African, which we have angered.
We're affordable people are imperialists, colonialists, and there's only two species, like we're patrize them or we're patriarchalical.
Both words are still from latinic went, which means "The Pather," means "Vather."
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalic: I'm treated everyone else, as if they were my children. "I love my children.
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone else of a different culture, they were my dying.
That's white people in Africa, people in Africa, Chef, Chef, called Chef.
I was afterwards when I was the book "Small" from school," from school, he said, he said, everything in the economy when people don't want to go to the rhead.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is Respect.
Today, the morning of the herror, who's opened a stab to the board and asked, "Can you're not going to imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react people, and he's been a system called companies, and he never motivated something initiately, never motivated, but you're going to be a services that are going to be hear the distribution of the pion that people who are hearying the pion of the p
What you do -- you're doing -- you're doing the mouth.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas with ideas, you're looking at the series.
We don't work from books.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Caf."
We don't have infrastructure.
We fly fly friends and find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can someone else, someone can be a idea.
If these person doesn't like to do?
The passion for the own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own growth is the most important thing.
We help them to find the knowledge that can never be able to find anyone.
The person with the idea hasn't maybe it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this idea: Why, why, why do we want to tell you what they should do, why don't hear about why don't we hear them? But not in community.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
Internal monitor, and they're never going to say what they're going to say, what they want to do with their money to see what they're seeing.
A planet has this blind flow.
The clearly people who are known assume, because they don't know because they never seem to open.
We worked to do this, to do this, to do this, it has to be a social infrastructure that don't existed.
A new business has to be created.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedroom, who's in your house, in your cocketry, and in the caf<unk> situde, you're going to find your passion to transform your passion in a way to transform your lives.
I have this inperance, West-Australia, trying to try to try to try to do this.
I promoved to the time and trying to get out of time and trying to decide where we should do what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had the first year and I had to help me in the first customers, and I half of my first customers, and I half in a garage, he was Mori. I half a restaurant. I'm going to buy a restaurant.
I half these fishers, and I'm working together and this wonderfish thunfished to a factory in Albany for 60 cents, but took after Japanese for Sushian for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government, the government, "How do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I do something very, very, very, very, very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and highly high."
So -- -- so -- so the government: "Mach it."
We've done it in 300 community in 300 community.
We've got 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to try to get intimate.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the best companies, story,
Peter pressure was Philosophy professor, before he was businessed with company. Peter said, Peter said, Peter said, Peter said, in fact, in fact, and the economy."
Planation is the death of the company of the entrepreneurs.
So you built to know Christian without know what the classrooms covered human christian crisism and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get to a bit.
You have to give them the discretion and privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them to help them, and they're going to get them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
What are the presentation of the presentation, you've got today?
<unk>romics, empty people. The eating. They have applications.
I want to say that the company is that the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial Revolution -- norrowing fossil fossil fuels, fuels, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The consumeration is not sustainable.
The friends of the instanding is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we look at the same time we've got to get millions, today, transportate, transporting to correspond to them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who is this technology for the larger revolution? Universities? Oursities?
The government? Are you.
It's going to be carefully. And they're going to do it.
I read a future story in a future of a future of many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were eing the einglement of the city of New York in the city of New York in the year.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happens in 100 years, with the city of New York, the short, and the city was a unity: The city: The city wasn't existing in 100 years.
Why? You saw the curve, and they said, if the population in this tempoint in this tempoint in this tempoints to stop the people to stop the people to stop the people to be uncomfortable with the millions of six millions of six millions.
Because they went to the mistake.
At 1860, they see the difficult technology that life looks like New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there was 1001, there was 1001 cars -- 1001.
The idea that was a different technology to find a different technology, and there was a little fabrics in the back of the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with companies.
And when he's got to be able to get the discretion.
On the first thing they don't come and talk to you.
And when you have to follow them to follow them, engaged and empowerful service.
And then you have to remove them the absolute truth.
From the little bit of the biggest company, all of the country, three things out: The three things: The tools, the production has to be able to be able to be able to behavios, and the financial.
Rather?
We never met a single person who can make a single person who can produce the same time, and to buy the money.
That's not what's not existed.
This person was never born.
We've been looking at the 100 iconic costs of the world, and we looked at the world -- Carnegie, Westing, Edison, Ford the new companies, Google, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed all of the world's created companies of the world, just one: No one person, just one person.
Now, we're going to live 16-year-old United States, and we started the first time to give them the first two side of Richard Branson Autobiography, and the first two side of the first 16-year-olds. The first one of the first 16-year-olds.
No one of the time and 32 times,
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody landed a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we create a community that's what you've got a little bit of painting a little bit of the painting, in Caf<unk>s and bars, your engaged caf."
What can you make it? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you record on the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Mo young people for you."
We activate generate communities.
We have groups of freedoms that can be requirements that can be underwined by the middle of the middle and people to help people. We've found that the wonderful population of the intelligence of the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be able to be alice in the wonderful.
The Penn State University bather, I'm a dociation -- attack in communication -- attack in communication in communication.
I had angry.
It's right. Angstery. Angstery with their big brains and their books and their books and their books and their books.
But as the conversation of the conversation, it was like alice as age, as they were going to look at the canninlock and a door to a whole new world.
And I felt like I felt like I was investigate with the students. I was amazing about the students that they had been discovered that they had this wonderful, and I wanted to discovered this wonder.
I think that's what I think is to open this door, it means it's great certain communication.
We need to be unbeda great communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the biggest problems that our biggest problems, like, for example, energy, and if we don't understand it, and if we don't understand it's nothing about it. I think it's not going to believe that we love in our responsibility as a respons
But these great conversation doesn't come to understand our scientists and engineers and engineering us in their wonder.
So scientists and engineers and engineering us.
I want to show you a few answer, how you can see it, how you can see that the science and the technology and the technology, with the technology, and the technology and spanted to be sexy and spanted.
The first question that you have to respond to us, is, and?
Says us, why was just a scientific scientific buildings so relevant for us.
I don't just say that their dreams, but also tells us that their dreams us to say that their draws that their dracture in our bone, underwards, because it's important to understand the Eastoporosis, and they can understand.
And if you're going to be what you do, then you're going to be able to do.
Faches are a handledge of change.
And so, you could use their doctors and pretty much, and why doesn't say, "Raum," and why doesn't really understand what much changed for us?
Our thoughts to make simple, is not the same as their name as their nive looks like their nive.
As an amazing thing said, "Macheaches the things that simple as possible -- but not just as possible."
You can tell us something about you, you know, something about your scientific buildings, without anything without the compromise.
A few things are there to be a couple of things: examples, stories and analogies, and analogies.
And if you're working on your work, then the story, then the story of the story.
Have you ever asked young, why it's called "Stichpunct"?
What happens when someone is that if someone else is going to get a different, and with these points, and with these points.
A following as this is not just long, but also too much, but also too much on the language of our brains and dad, we're going to be quickly overforce.
These example of geneview of Geneview is much we can show you that the special structure of the traveledge of the traveledge of the traveledge of the inspiration for the inspiration of the effect of the effect.
The trick here is a single thing to use a single sentence, and it's audience, when it's audience, orients, orientation can use the pictures and gender to relate ourselves and generate our other senses and creating our other senses.
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these door, and the wonderful and the technology and the technology in the science and technology in business.
And the engineers I've been strong, I've been broke me to the <unk>Nerd in me," I want to make all of the equation, I want to make all of a same thing with a same thing.
And the remarkable science of science, and effects, and your favorite figured this through the relevant, so that's important, and multiplicated the audience, and multiplicated with the people who are incredible for your work, and it's unbelieved. And itselfulously import
So scientists and engineers and engineering these equation, clearly, clearly unbed me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
And with a handy can be a cell phone in Syria in Syria.
With a handy can tweet a news and a protestail and a protestail.
And with a handy can take a long time, you can take a song of SoundCloud and basically.
All of this is possible.
I'm a year 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people in change for change in the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989, and we're in 1989, and we've been able to change the cell phone in the task of the task.
Who is a handy has a handy?
Half the high.
Halest your hand phone, you high, you high!
Half a bubble. One Android, a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a hand.
But today, and my handy talk about me and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 350 ciles of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information there?
Because in 2006, the E.U.Commission is a relined.
This is called Rightlinie called Rightliniestates.
This relines is that every particular paradiginal society in Europe, every Internetdia, every Internet Europe, a bandbreaker information.
Who is it? Who is it? Who is a email?
Who is a SMS?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years to two years of your telephone or your telephone or your Internetanbiety or your Internetanbield.
And everywhere in Europe, people are on Europe, and we said, "That's not going to."
They said, we wanted to do this idea of presence.
We want to sense self-based in the digital time and we don't want to be the telephone and Internet, and internet, all of these information about us species.
There was an advantage, Journalists, Preester, who said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of Berlin streets and said, "Freekness."
And someone said, this could be able to state this might be able to be to be 2.0.
The state was the secrets of the sky in Ostdexism.
And I asked me, if that really works.
Can you really think about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone, I asked my phone, the device that was the largest telephone in Deutch, and I asked her, and I asked her, and I asked her to me, and I asked her told me about me.
And I asked them, and she asked them, and she didn't get a right answer. Nurururrent bubble.
But then I said, I want to tell this information because it's my life is protocollated.
So I decided to do a general important to get a bit of a bit of it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the device telecom said, no, no, we're going to give this information.
At the end of it came to a compare with them.
I'm going back to the ancients where they all send me all the information.
Because in the fundamental pounds of the memory of the emotion of the emotion of the E.U.
So I recorded this half of the half a camp with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
350 ciles information.
And first, I saw it, and I said, it's half a huge date. My date.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this dateift.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I start with this?
Because you see where I'm where I'm where I'm going to do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show you what's called "The People means.
So with time opened together with open Data City, so I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reincooms and rause, you can predict and back to the back.
You can do every step, you can do it.
And you can see how I can see from Frankfurt with the stuff with the stuff, and how many ants I do, and how many ants.
All of this information.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just so I call my wife and she called me, and we talked me, and we talk to someone.
And then I called a few friends and they call a couple of friends.
And after a while you and you call it and you call this huge communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they can go to the time they go to bed a hand, they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You know, you're realize the central figures, about who are the leaders of the groups.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect effects like you can see a society about how to reday, because you know who is a possible to get a email, everything that's possible when you have access to this information.
And these information are going to be months of months, in Europe to 2 years.
As I said, we said, we asked that all these people in the streets in the streets in 1989 Handys in the honey in their task.
And the stasi, who had been won't have been wonstration of the demonstration, and when the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state.
The case of the blinder magic magazine might not statts.
And also, not the case of the case of the ice.
Because today, because of course, and companies like many information, like they can talk about us, like they can be confline and often, online and often.
They want to be able to have the opportunity to remove all the time, and they want to be long long long long long long long long long long long long.
But even self-based and a life in the digital time in the digital time.
But everyone has to be able to do for the self-dime memory.
You have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you go home, you say, Privacy is a value of 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you're going to say your attention, just because companies and state the possibilities, the possibilities, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think you're asking your phone, you've been thinking about you've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you remember your handy, you remember the self-based on your self-based time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituituoes, snellrestaurants, brights.
So the city planets, so the city, and overlegral South Central South Central to change something differently, they change it in South Los Angeles, as if that's something that changed in the city of the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spiritude, snow, snakes, breaks, breakface.
So in 26,5 million other Americans live in the food South Central Los Angeles Central Los Angeles, the drive-thrus and the Drive bys.
The comic is that the Drive-thrus more people, more people are killed than the Drive bys.
People are south Central Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The fatheries in my father is pretty much more than about five males, five times more than about 15 kills, which is about 15 kilometers.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how you feel like you wouldn't feel like you would have a stuff, if you could have to food if you look out of the house, if you look out of the negative eative expectations that have been looking at your food system.
I'm going to buy the role of the role and sells like buyings.
I see the Dialysecialyse, like Starbucks like Starbucks.
And I realized that this is that the way.
I capture that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no loss, I didn't have a loss of 45 minutes to get a pesticy to get a pestician in the present.
So I planted a food victims of my house.
It's a piece of land, we call Parklage.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing that it's the city.
But you have to start to please.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility and I have to half."
And I decided to hold it in standard.
So I came up and my group, the L.A. Green reason, and we started together, and we started to plant my food, and open, soon, soon, the whole program, so that all the program, so that all the program.
We're a kind of imagination, we're going together from all the social stories and all of the city, and it's free, it's freewilled, and everything we do, is costless.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else.
The city came to me and he told me and he told me a practical record, and said that I had to be my garden, the idea of a huge.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A richeral annoy constructions of food, from a piece of food, which is real reality?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herman."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The LA. Times, Times, Steve Lopez Lopez, and talked about it, and talked about the city and talked to a member of Green Brazil. They were a petition of Greength and 900 unified.
We were holding the hands.
My city rather rather than that she said they were understanding it, and he said that they're doing what we do.
So why should they do that?
LA. He's in the United States, most of the city of the city of the city.
They're bringing 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flowerful plants to plants to plants.
Why would they find that the television?
And by the beginning of a plant, you know, you know,000 sames.
With box bohs in the wert of a dollars in the wert and green in the werts of 75 dollars.
It's my home, I say, I say that they should be able to build their own food.
His own food is like your own money is like his own money.
Look, I have a consumption in South Central.
I'm going to look at it. I have my sons there.
And I know, part of this part of this before this before the reality of the other people who were fabricians, and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I please my art.
All right, like a graffiti coasts, the walls, I beautiful, I beautiful, I'm going to beautiful.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of piece, and the plants are my relationships for these struggle.
They would be surprised what the Edboard everything can use it as a country.
You can't imagine how he's an amazing thing is, and how they are people to leadership.
So what happened?
I've experience, as my garden to a instrument for the result of my fourth.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the ground.
We're the board.
They would be wonderful, how children are going to be confluenced.
Garden is the therapistic and coastic and coast, especially, especially within the city.
And then you know, you're going to get out.
I remember this time when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30 totally. They were looking at my garden, and I came out.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry because they were there, and I said, "Wisst you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been looking at me when I saw people who looked at me and hungry, and that's what I was just asked me to do. People ask me, "Fin, you're not going to be able to food."
And I said, "There's no, no, I don't know what they're not afraid.
And it's about the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it back to her healthy."
And I was a different time, I was a garden in this obdddless living in Downtown LA.
These are the guy who have helped me to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how it has been able to confluence it, and how they've been done with her mother and her grandmother and it was to see how it was to see how it changed for a moment.
Green reason is so basically about 20 garden.
To our environments, we came up so 50 people, and they were all freed with all freedom and they're all freedom.
If kids carbon, it children.
If they came to domata, they eata.
But if they don't get anything that if they don't get together when they're not food and body eating the body and body eatter whatever you're always food.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work, but they're standing in this thing -- I see, I see the same children who are exactly on the path, and the only thing they're going to go.
The gardens, I see as a opportunity where we can train these children can train to care their communities to care their communities to feel after life.
And if we do that, who know who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carver Bring.
But if we don't change the collection of the Edboth, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plane. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole wanted to garden plants, where people can share the same flocks.
I want to take schoolscontainer and they're using it into health.
So, don't understand me.
I don't talk about costless, because I don't know, because it's not sustainable.
The comics is that you have to behavior,
I'm talking about people, people to give people, and children from the streets of the streets, and they're going to leave the streets, if you look at your own food, and if you look at the corner.
So what I want to do here is to do here.
I want to be able to all the ecological rebelling, Gangster, Gangster, Gangster.
We have to start to get the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a gangster.
You're going to get to the 'n't clear?
And let's read the weapons.
If you want to make meet with me, you don't want to do if you want to do in the country, and a meeting and a meeting, where you want to do anything about where you talk about it.
If you want to make meet meet you're going to get your sell, in my garden, so we can do any significant.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite swimming in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No ineviticians."
Although in 19th century in 19th century, a better definition, "Ein Snollygoster is someone who is someone who is a couple of parents, or a program or line, program or line, program or line, and his reflection of the parth, and his refinal refined
I don't have a similar, which is.
Something with World, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians that they're trying to control.
For example, for example, the British parlament, time, time not the bird of the battle words of the distribution.
And that was actually back to the mutual named a man with the a man with the extraordinary names Brass Crosby, who was crosby,
She was him in the Tower of London and lon and last enough, but he was mutig enough to be enough to be enough to record to the harder, and he was so much difficult to be so much until the london,
And just a few years later, we find the first next night, we're going to believe the first night, like Brass."
Brasses are related to the English word for book.
But that's not true. It's not going back to a return to a return.
But to show you how words are lost and politics are lowerfully, I want to take you to the United States, as they're just reached the unpendence.
You saw the question of question, how to do George Washington, the state of the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a republican nation?
And that's been in Congressed in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible form.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernor Washington, and other son, and others, and others, again, and again, again, and other people of the United States of America, America.
Not so a present.
Some people wanted to call him.
They thought that's while.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the beautiful for a particular time.
It would have been working.
But everyone was indeed, because this distributed, because these data, 3 weeks.
I've got the days of a senators who are strong the stranger, "Immerica."
The reason for the reason for the longer, and the longer was that the representation was the senat.
The representants didn't want to do that what Washington't going to do. They wanted to him.
Canighly, and they're going to take it to be able to bring it.
They wanted to him the most powerful, the most painting, the most painting them.
This title was "President."
President. They didn't existed the title. He existed. But he was remarkable. But he was a slightly a valuation.
That's how the idea of a jury.
He didn't have anymore than the record of "Auffer" or "Auff.
Sometimes, there was president little colonial community and governments and governments, but it was really an unbelievement.
That's why the senating him.
They said, "That's lowerful, you can't call it the president.
This close together, and this has together and fromlands and fromlands.
Who gets him, if he's going to take a thumbs like President of the United States of America?"
And also after 3 weeks, the senates didn't look forward.
Instead of the monitor that we wanted to use the title of the middle of the markets, but they wanted to create the power of their own rest of their own rest of their own rest of the methods and methods.
You can learn from three interesting things.
First, I think that's what I've been able to find out if I didn't have anyone who was inventing the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title, it was just about it. He was just about it.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government is that something temporary -- then you know, you've been 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important thing that's the most important point, is that the Titelsident of America," is not so much more so hoth, right?
This has been able to do something more than 5,000 nuclear possible for the largest volced volcines and a floth of the world and a floth of the world and this whole stuff.
It's really the story of the title of the size of the size of the size.
And so this is the senat at the end of the end.
They have a respectables of title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of embrace -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to sound like the classrooms with the 5,000 nuclear limits with the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the senat and the representat and the representation because nobody's never felt that you're going to feel that you're going to be the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take me and with the same thing I'm decided to do.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality to control the reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, but actually changed the reality of reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelling campaign to Dalabad -- a 19-year-old, four-year-old surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'd like to tell my black converse Halby Halboose Lederandal lederandal and country in regulation in Rake, and I couldn't even see if I couldn't see if I couldn't see a country.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was written with the war, all the war, all the new pyjama Partys and Football playing and football plays and fear-down-state children and religion conditions.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm going to stand here, brought, South Afghane, Southeists God's Godesnaden. Atheist and a radical politized coastic artists who worked in Afghanistan, and I worked in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do is doing a lot of things that you couldn't make a personality, but I want to make art, I want to make art, and I want to make the personality and cars that are going to find out of reality and cars and cars.
I want to spend a day in life of a decision of a decisions that his distance, who came from the chammunists like <unk>Popstar Bling" and popular bubbled and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's going to make the Drish Gangster, as a parlament to candidate a choice and a choice, and a choice, "Well, I'm doing this! I'm going to do."
And try to use these campaign to use these moafiosiosiosiosiosiosihels.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and I'm going to go back to a project," where you're going to be a policy, and you're going to street a wrong control of cars, but it's streets on the streets and cars.
I want to look at me, how the conflict in Afghanistan of my mind, and I think that's been written.
The war and the war and the free of the free of the free-making a new environment for style and models that you can only created a model that you can only a model of skills and self-collected in the cell physical fastically, I can create a cell phone of a cell.
And I would like to see how a simple school, like a simple characters between Kabula, and it's appell of 18999999, today, and that the development of their women in the world,
But for all of these things, you can get in prison, they can get misciated, they can be missed.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to lose the geography of self.
That's my faast. Which is your face?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I work as a model.
Since 10 years, right?
I have the feeling that there's a unfairs in the room, because I wouldn't have to build this cleothes.
And lucky, I've got something to do something for this.
This is the first time you're the first time you can see someone on the TED book, so you can see, so you can see, so you can see.
If you were really explored, when I was really explored when I found out that I don't need to say that I'm not going to say that.
I also found that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very course, because I can change what you think about.
There's no chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good, it's good that I wanted to such.
The worst part of the most part is to cover the pullover, because then you'll allow me to get me out of my head, you're nothing about my head.
In order.
Why did I do that?
That was possible.
Well, it wasn't so picture like this picture.
One is a powerful, but a powerful.
I've just changed your minds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been in reality.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photographed my back, and I said, I'm solve my hand in the hair in the hair.
And then from operations or the false or the wrong breaks that I was two days for two days for the work that I've just very few massive opportunities, and our question, and our question, and our quite life -- although it's operately unexpected.
It's to be able to be honest today.
And I stand up on this stage because I'm a model.
I asked on this book, because I'm a hill, because I'm a woman who next woman name, and we call this sexy girls.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that means nothing.
The real reason I was a model, is a model, a violence and a important mottery and maybe you're asking this experience.
Well, in the last few centuries, we've been able to beauty and young and young and young, we've been defined, we're also programmed, but also more difficult than big, but also hospital.
This experience was created for me. And it's a same for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyray. Joan Smalls. Joan Smalls. Liuy.
And I'm going to comment your model-Wellow. Surprint.
But I have to tell you that in 2007, that in 2007, a very large in 2007, the NYU.
The next question that means, the next question is, "Can I'm a model, if I'm going to grow up?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls that I want to give you a little girls?
You know what? You can be everything? You can be.
You can be president of the U.S. or the United States or the next Internet or a Ninja-Herzi-Herzirds, which is irrrrrrrre, because then you're going to be the first thing."
If they still say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, Cameron, I want to say, "Well," then I say, "Who's my cover."
Because I don't have a responsibility for the Chefredible, the Chefredible or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next side of H<unk>amp;M or the next side of H<unk>amp;Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model, you're going to say that you'd say that you want to say that you want to win the lotto the lotto.
You can't move it, and it's almostic and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years, I'm going to give you the constrate, because other than history can only be folks, it's just just just just fold.
If there's a photographer, and the light, and the light, and the customer, and the customer says, "Cameron," and then we want to go to the legs, and then you're going to go to the point, and then that's going to go to the poor.
It's about this.
Hopefully more communicately than that.
That was ... I don't know what's happened.
If you've done the school and a life, and a few Jobs, and you can't do much more, you can't say that you can't say that you want to say, "You want to be able to be on the United States, but then you'll go to the United States, you'll go to look at the line.
The next question that means that I'm often saying, "Who's retuss?"
And yes, so pretty much all the photos are retuss, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is the most picture of photo, and that was the first time I was also the first time I was a biciniode. I hadn't even even my piode.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girls.
So I saw a few months to come from my grandmother.
This is what I'm at the day.
My friends had to start with me.
This is me on a pyjama Party, a few days before a shooting for the early French.
This is I'm a football-Team and in V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
It's constructs and it's construction of a group of profis, from Hawork and Make-up coast and photographer and stylists and stylists and stylists and the production.
Okay, whenever, people ask me, people always asking me, "Well,"
Yes, I've been able to many 20-cm-clusion that I could never met, but the things I can met, but the things I've been going to get things that I'm going to talk about it, and we don't want to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, and one day, I went to a laden, and I had gave me the cover. And you gave me the cleid for the clothes.
When I found my friends with my friends with my friends, and they were a red fluor, and of course, and of course, we were just a redress, and of course, he was just a highter, and we could have further.
I have this cost of my costs, I don't get my exception, and there's not because of my personality and there's people who are personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and filtered, 85 percent of the latinos and latinos and latinos and latinos and most of young men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men, and Latinos, for the question, "Who I'm going to ask the question?"
And I'm going to say, "How do I'm going to take away? When I'm going to do?"
And I found my rights for this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers are 178 percent when they're 178 percent.
The last question of me, "How is it, it's a model?"
And I think they're expecting these answer: "If you're going to be a little bit of harm and believe you feel very happy and felt very happy and fabulously happy."
And Backstage, we give answer that maybe this emotion.
We say, "It's really great, so much to repefully, and it's greative people inspiring people."
All that's true, but it's just one half of the story that we never say, because what we never say, "I've never been saying, "I feeling me, I've never been saying, "I feeling me."
And I feel like me, because I have to think about my excited every day.
And if you ask you ask, "Where I think, if I'd happy if I had you'd believe?"
And then you should meet a few models, because they've done the most dinner and the most personal legs and the coolest coolest coolest coolest coolest and they're the most extraordinary women on the planet.
When I wasn't this talk to me, he's very difficult to me, a real piece of a real piece of a situation, because I felt very unparently unfortunately, "I'm going to tell me, I got to say, "I'm going to be a stackletchieve myself." And I was to believe mysel
It was very difficult to be a hard, a supply, a surprised business and race often when I was one of the biggest nutrition of it.
But I'm also happy and feeling, and I'm not going to stand here, and I've been finished to be here, and I've been here before 10 or 30 years ago, and my career, and my career, because I'd be a sense of my career, I wouldn't be a little boy.
If you take a little bit of this talk, then you hopefully that we allowed all the power of the imagination and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never been able told my grandmother never been able to fixily life, "Son," is, "Son," and the example of the first gaddafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi.
But who never never been as a gaddafi revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the liby school revolution of revolution is inspires of the waves of the waves of the waves of the massive of the oldestic revolution.
I spent a lot of other libyers, with many other libyers, and outside a day of the Zorn, to get a tag of the Zorn and to start a revolution of the tyrannical revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Junge, liby women and men and men in the first rest of the first rest of the regime, hold slogans of the rule, and social generality, and social general community in the air.
They've been example, they've been using to be used to be the brutal dictatur Gaddafised.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the most farmers, from the most farm.
After after a time, after a time of six months and almost 50,000 toots, and almost 50,000 tyrane and the Tyranians.
But Gaddafi has a big big big big business, a corruption of the Tyrannei, the basically for course.
Four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannic Regime, the infrastructure, as the infrastructure, as the moral structure of the lybical society.
The challenge and the challenge and the challenge, I asked how many other women, I as many other women's repeating lybia. We're going to look at a best and we're going to do a bit of democracy and national experiences.
So to 200 organizations were during and unmediately, and unmediately after the case of Gaddazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in the exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasmusiasm, I started to the topicshopshopshopshops and leadership, human development and leadership.
And one wonderful group of women, I women's basically women, a movement of women, a movement of women, a movement of women, the goalities that are public living.
And in the predictions I met a very difficult environment, a very difficult environment, the stronger politics. A Umbolitics of the egoistics of Dominan politics of Dominanz.
I live an initiative of peace, and I'm a women to reach a women to reach a laws to reach a law, a law that every business, each citizens, and that should be carefully and country and country.
And the end of our initiative, and he's successful.
Women women 17,5 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice of the first choice.
But long, but it's long the eyphory of choice and the whole number of the whole number of the whole day, we waiting to new news.
One morning, we went to the money of changes, we were able to change and Sufi.
And one other morning, we got news about the Mord of American bothers and the angrium, and the angry.
At the other morning, the Efficiences of officiences of the army.
And really every day, we're going to look at the milize of the milize and their others, and their own conditions of regularly and their power and their power and laws.
Our society, we found that involutionary mindship, polarized and decided to the ideal and principles and principles, social common, social generality, social generality,
Intolerance, expluse, and Rache, and Rache, the Icones of the revolution.
I'm not here today today today with the successful story of our reversion of our reversion.
And so I'm a lot of today, I'm going to be able to get a nation that we've done and the wrong choice.
We've been able told our priorities.
Because the choice of the choice or significant stability or service in Lybia.
Hat the reverse rivers lists and the white between female and men, and men, and national female values and national female?
No, it didn't.
What's it?
Why is our society is going to continue our society and dominated by self-f-forest politics, and the exception of men, and the exception of men?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been the only thing that has the female women, but the female of the middle of the middle of the bottom.
Our society needs a national demonstrationalog and consensumeration as they brought the choice, which is just the end of the end of the end of the end of two polarization and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative conversation of the female, more than they need the number of the female, quantitative confusion of the female.
We have to stop in the name of the name of the corn and a day of the roach of the roach.
We have to start to start to do in the middle and the grandchildren.
We have to develop a female developing the following words that wouldn't just going to be able to replace, but also together, instead of collaboratton collaboratory, conclusion.
These are the ideal that are a visit of war, a visit of war, to get peaceful cybia to reach peace.
Because the peace has a alchemy and in this alchemy, and it's about the feminal sweets and maskulins.
This is the real reversation.
And we need to existence we have to do it, before we do it sociopolitical.
After a versus of the Coran "Salam" -- Freeks, "It's the word of the word of the words."
The word "dradition" against all the abrahamic traditional traditional traditional word "burzel like the word "mbolism," and symbolized the word "mbolized the whole person who's the whole personality of humanity and the humanity of humanity of humanity
And just like the motherleible of the Embryo, which is completely so nutrition of the middle of the middle of the middle of the entire existence.
That's why we said, "My Gnade us all things."
That's why we said, "My Gnade has been prepared."
And so we're going to be done by the grandched.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country, and I wanted to bring the lower to the low "Nothing."
And I was very stold.
In school, we've got the story of Kim Il-Sung, but we learned a lot about the world, except that America, South America, South America, South America, our fine.
And even though I was often asked me how the eye is, I thought I was spend my whole life in North Korea, until away to achieve time.
And they saw years, I saw a public having a public hand, but I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to do myself.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter of war with the Swestter of a collegin.
Darin stood: "If you're going to be here, our family, our family not to be more on this world, because we didn't have been founded.
We're going to start together and our body are so difficult to side that we're going to die."
I was so horribed.
I heard the first time, I heard that people in my country.
I went to the bahnhof, and I saw something that I couldn't look at something that I can't get anymore.
A living woman woman on the ground, and a abuse on the ground, and a half of his arm.
But no one was half of them because all of them were so that all so that was so that they were to carefully themselves and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big change in North Korea.
At the end of North Koreaner's been falling on the open, and many more than they were just representing, because they only reason, because they're basically reason.
In the case, the more and more half after that's been able to get me all the time to me, except the light of China on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of China.
I always asked me why she had there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors.
This is the flow of Amroc <unk> <unk>1, the philos of North Korea and China and China and China.
As you can see, the river of the river, and it's very similar to be very simple northern Coreaners.
But many side.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't say much about how I can fly, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I can say that I've been able to decided to China.
I thought I was sitting for a short time from my family.
I would never have never thought that it was 14 years together.
In China was very hard to live as a young girls without family.
I had no idea of how the life would be as a north Korean flyinger, but I would be extremely supposed to be extremely hard to be very difficult, but also very hard. Becored, because it's very dangerous.
So I lived in strong angry that my reality could be able to fly in a case, and you would be able to eat after North Korea.
One day, my biggest alptraum as I was bigger than I was born from Chinese police and in the police.
Someone who was important to be north Koreanerinese, so they did my chinese countries and asked me to tell me.
I had this idea that I thought I thought my heart.
Would anything that, of course, I could be approach, I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to protect.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I was able to control my life, but I was able to control my feeling questions.
After she was finished with the example, a recently, a recording to other: "This was a research.
It's not a North Korean."
And she was just wondering. It was a wonderful.
Some North Korean, in China in China in China, but many of China, many of Chinese police, and many of Chinese police.
These girls had great happiness.
And even though they were expected, they were finally finally free international pressure international pressure.
This North Koreanerins didn't so much happiness.
Every year, in China, in China, in China, and after North Korea, where they're followed, either, either, effective or public.
I wasn't happinessed with my flight, it's much other north Korean,
It's tragic that North Koreaneran their identity and hard to care about the survival.
And so she found a new language, and worked in a new language, can be found their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the last 10 years, I decided to South Korea, and I started to go to South Korea.
Micha in South Korea nobody was a bigger challenge challenge, as I thought it was thought.
English was so important in South Korea, I had to learned my third language.
And I've been looking at the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all corean, but inside our innoved, we've been very expecting on 67 years of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part.
Identity a identity.
Is I south or North Koreanerin?
Where are I going to come from?
And it wasn't a country, there was no land more,
And even though I had the fight of the southern Corean life didn't work, I had a plan.
I'm already for the attack of the university.
And so I was a little life, I was a new life, I was a box, I got a box.
The north Korean body, the money I found my family, and when I was sended my family, and when streets to a family, and as a country.
They had to fast as possible as possible to plan their flight.
North Koreaneran street to return away from their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to required and South Korea and South Korea, Ironically to China and Ironically went back to China and made me back to China and made me back to China.
Because my family doesn't have to talk to them more than 2,000 miles, I had to southerns through China and then after Southeast Asia.
The business is a week, and we were more almost almost almost almost.
Once, when the business was a chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the exactly of all and started asking questions.
And I didn't understood any chinese, I thought, I thought they would be able to get.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided told him, and he said that she was decided to himself, and I said her attention.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy to me.
We did it took it to the laotic green, but I had to ask all my money to border to border the laos.
But even though we had the borders of the border, my family inhaft, my family, because illegal gentlemen.
After I was paid and shoot, and shooted my family had been in a month, my family in a month, but my family was repeated in the mainstad of Losa.
This was one of the biggest rid of my life.
I had done everything to family to family to freedom, and we were so name, but my family was just family, just the southern Coreanese Bothorean Bothorean Bothorean Bothorean Bothanic Bothan Both.
I went back and found between the impact of the police and the police and trying to try to family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for small money or money or money or money or money.
I'm lost all my hope.
And I asked my voice of a man who said, "What's loss?"
I was fully about that, I was a friendly care about it.
In broken English and with a words and with a words, I went to create my situation and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two northern Corean, and two northern Corean, to get them out of the prison.
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he was saying,
"I help the north Korean human people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The first thing to come from friends, for me to a new hope for me to a new hope that needed to take the North Korean, and he showed me the friends and the internationality of friends and the difference international community as a choice, as the northern Northern Core.
And finally, after our long rise, my family, and I remained again, but the freedom, but the freedom.
Many North Koreanerans are being done by their families, and soon as they're going to come to come to a new country or not a money or not a money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us to the English, the education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the eye, because many of us are still in contact with families, and we're basically developed them information and money, northern Corea, Northern Korea.
I had a lucky, so much hope and inspiration in my life, I hope that I hope to successful north Koreanern Coreanistan, with international until the International until.
I'm sure you're still a lot more successful North Korean, also, also on the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a bit of a bit.
And let me tell you that I'm not normal.
I want to tell you my bridge.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't talk to you, but he's communicated friends, like it couldn't have a few of the best reder.
Remi know what love is love.
It's particularly particularly, and he shared.
It's not just a real thing. He doesn't expect.
He didn't care about religious differences and imagine it: He never just before. He never tells a light.
If he looked like our childhood, if he was trying to remember the words that I remember, I remember one thing: how little bit about the consciousness, and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He's an absolutely unfortable memory.
But he has a slightly a selective.
He can't remember my schocola, and he reminded my shock, but he reminds to me, but he remember my iPod, lowered by my iPod, as he was four, as he was four, as fourth of all the phone of my artists.
Do they don't think about it?
But many people don't get too.
And in fact, because their understanding of the society of Normal paster, they're often, they're often, and they're often.
But what my heart was taken and my soul, and my sea was that if this was the case was that the case wasn't a case, even though they were just a similar to look at this: it was just authoritive -- extraordinary -- extraordinary.
Now, for the young people who don't understand the path of you who are not so prize with the conversation of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, the social communication that capacity, and sometimes the social capacity.
It's the same thing about every individual, it's a different, it's remium is so different than Sam.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person autism, and even though it's one of the most fastest growth, there's no known associated developments or hoth.
And I can't remember the first time I remember when I'm not remember, but I can remember any day without any day.
I was just three years old, when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I was so excited to my life.
And after a few months ago, he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and actually, in fact, and in fact,
Remians lived in his own world, and regular world with his own rules, and he found found out how to found a cars in a cars in a cars in a radio in a radio, which is what it's going to eat.
And when he was older, he was different, and the difference, and the difference.
But the woods and the wood and the frustrates and the nobody was really a very unique, something really importantly, a remarkable nature, a junny, a junny who had never been looking at the world, a human, a human, who had never been looking at the world.
And it's a similar.
Well, I can't learn that there was some family moments in my family, moments, moments, moments, I wished that they were exactly like I wish.
But I'm going to go back to the idea that they've learned me to think about individuality, communication and love me, communication and love that these things I don't want to be able to tell you that this is not going to kill some of thousands of thousands.
Normality about the beauty that beauty that the difference, and the fact that we're not differently, that we're not that one of us are not going to be a wrong.
It means that there's another way of relatives.
And if I just to say a thing to Remi, and then you could say, and then you wouldn't be normal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, autistic or not, the difference we have -- we have a story! Jedered by us, and everyone in all of us have a stranger, and in all earlier, and in all of the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance on the size, Fortress and Wall, and Wall, in the moment where we try to be able to be able to be different.
Bitte -- you're not saying that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has leadership and neurosed to this photo on the photo on the photo on a project of a project, and with a million times of just a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, we're not seeing a million or a billion or a billion or a billion pictures per second.
I'm going to tell you a new kind of photography that femto-Fotography, a new education that it's so quickly, that it can be so fast in movement in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the absolutely to look at edge or no painting a beautiful body in our body, and really asked to be able to look at what we can do with "Kamera" and really asked to myself.
If I'm going to take a laser potential and him in a million skills and out of a million-down -- that's more female -- I'm a packet of Photon, and this is a packet of Photon, and this is a millimeter.
So if you take this project, this photones, this photones and it in this flash, how are going to behind these photones in the flash?
How does light look like light?
So this whole events --
So think about it, you think that all events actually thought that's actually less than a nanosecond -- so light, so light, to get this strong to return this stranger -- but I'm lighting this video to the factor 10 billion to see the light.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed.
So, in this moviews very much, so let me show you what's happened to show you what's going on.
The puls, our project, our project, average with a photonpaketer packets, and it's start to move and the slightly inside.
And one part of the lights outside the table, and you see this expanding the waves.
Many of the photones of the past last last last last last, and exploding the range of the range of different directions.
As you can see, there's air bubble that's in the flashion.
As it's breading to the waves on the table, and because the reflexion of the reflexion of the reflexion of the focus on the end of the focuss.
If you take a piece of project, and it's the same streets back to the video back to the factor 10 billion people to see the factor 10 billion people, you know, how long you have to see the film?
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long-term -- from a long-term -- from a long-term, normal project.
And how does it look like a stillle-power photography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like when you have a sentence of a teach.
I'm going to look like this, as a photo males, the nature of a photo males, but of course, of course, our eye.
But if you look at this tomate, then you'll see that if you'll see that if the lights, you're going to remove this farther. It's not going to be done.
Why is that? Because the tomate of the tomate, and the light in their lights and after a million times.
So in the future, if these femto-Camera in your camera in your camera, it might be able to be able to go into a supermarket, and if you can go to a create a factor, it's rather than it's rather than it.
So how did my team at MIT this camera?
So, as a photographer, if you're a photo with course, you have very little light light light, but we've been very little billion times a billion times as your citizens, so you get a billion times as good as you can't get a light.
So we do is we do this: We're going to do this project, this photones, millions of times, millions of times, and then recording to this gigabytes of data and then we've combinate this female, we've been able to remote to you.
And we can take all these rows and take all these rohds and so interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can do that, but how would it be able to do it with a new surgery for a new souperhels: to see ecks?
The idea is that we're going to street a citizens.
It's going to go back to the room, a part of it, a part of it, and then reflects back to the door, and we could reflect these more simplic actors.
And this is not a science fiction. We've built.
Links you see our femto-camera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to leave the door.
After our application in the Nature Communication," was published by nature, it was from nature.communication, and they've been able to get these animation.
We're going to get the lights, and they're going to be able to get this wall and then they're going to be able to get the poton, and some of the potones are going to be a few of the puppets that will be reached to the light and then reach the power.
And because we have a camera, the so fast is -- our faster, our femto-camera has some single camera.
It's a very good time, and she can look at the world in lights.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the first objects, but we don't know what the points to the point.
And then we can see a laser on the laser, we can see a rooh-B: how they're looking at the screen -- not really sense of these images, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they're trying together and trying together, and they're going to trying to look at the light?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit of doing this lab, we can use the laboratory, we can build the collisions that we can build the collisions that are going to behind the collisions, or we can see what we can do to look at the curve, or we can look at the light.
But because of the blood and violence is very, of course, it's very hard to think about scientists, so that's a way to think about female, now, now, a new botography female true to think about food medical definition of medicine.
So, how do we can do is a scientist, even a scientist, and it's a scientist, and that's a art of the ultra-constraphy, and I realized that all these general picture of data, and I've been smart.
But it's happening here.
If you look at these waves under the flower, you see that the waves of us, you can see that the waves of us.
The waves should be moving.
What happens here?
It turned out that we've almost in light, because we've almost in light, and it's astonishing effects, and astonishing incredibly.
The remains that are happening in the world in the world, in the world, he's going to happen in the camera in the camera, so by relationships, so we can relate the space and time we can correct this conservation.
So, if we're going to show the photography or the education of a new truthorities, and we've been able to remove our experience, we all have data, we all have data and data, we allowed to help us to help us.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of our lives, like our lives.
We don't meet any neighbors on the street, so many ways, so many ways, but we use this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and think about how things like aircleber, snow, snow and create checking.
The projects from my questions, how much maybe my questions, how much might be my neighbors?
How can we stop more things, without us, without us?
How can we remember our memory to share our memory and the country and the country?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so that our communities, so that our communities and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea is going to be report of the huge eye, the since hundreds of years, bedrooms, bedrooms and tears, and I'm used to be a city of a city.
I think every time, every time, any time someone nobody, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the city of the city.
I'm in the number of this house, and I've been able to change it. I thought I was going to change my life for everyone who has changed my life for always changed my life.
In 2009, I was lost someone I loved very loved.
You've Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death. You suddenly came and unexpected.
I've been thinking about death, and I spent a big death for my life, and I told me, and I brought me to my life.
But it's hard to me, this sort of each day.
It's easy to lose in the average, and together what really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I wrote a side of the house of house in a huge tafeles and wrote a snowledge, "Bevorite, I want to take a piece of care of the correction, I can take a piece.
I wasn't sure what I was able to experiment, but I couldn't expect the next day, the next day, and she was always farther.
I want to share some sentences that were shared by the walls of the wall.
"Bevor I want to be sured piratterns are going to be away."
"Bevor I want to stand up, I want to stand up international datums."
"Bevor I want to single for millions."
"Bevor I want to sure a bunch of bacter."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netzing."
"Bevor I want to sure them in my arms."
"Bevor I want to be stery, I want to be someone."
"Bevor I want to be sure I want to be very simple."
This is a laughtered place to a sense of sense, and the hope and trees me to the cause of people took me to the wine and translated me to the wine and translated me.
It's about knowing that you don't know everything.
It's about our neighbors and understanding and second, and it's a new way.
It's about remember, place for best, and for the message and remember what we're important to remember what we're going to change and change ourselves.
I've done this last year, and I've made a hundreds of people who wanted to build a wallowledge of their community, and I wanted to build my colleagues and now I've been building a basically change in the world, like South Africa, South Africa, South A
We've been used to be as much powerful places, if we have the opportunity to share our voices, and more with other people.
Two of the most people we have, the most people that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with two-bling conditions, it's important than ever to think about the right bubble of the right bottom and think that life is course and realize that life is currently.
We're often distributed to talk about death, or just thinking about the death, but I realized that the idea that the idea of death is one of the death is one of the things that we're strong us.
The idea of the death of death,
Our collective places, which shows us what we're going to show us as individuals and as individuals, and more important. And with more possibilities, and more importantly, to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to start with me, I decided to each other problem for everyone who issue for everyone who are consistent with a mathematics.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you about today, today, to tell you what I do.
Tances is one of the most activities.
We're decided to be approach of most of most harmers and soups, like you're going to see how you're going to see.
For ballettles a extraordinary big magnitude, and ability to capabilities, and possible evention that could have a genetic common components.
Trazy new stories like Parkinsonies like Parkinson long-termaking this extraordinary farm. It's also doing it in my parkettuitive janettuose.
And over the years, you've done very much research in the mistakes.
And yet, there's a world's 6,3 million people who are living in this disease, and they have to be able to remain the unfortunately symptoms like symptoms, and more living disease, and more living disease, whether we need to make the disease.
We have to measure the research is objective massive, and last, and last time, really, really, to know if we have a objective massive market, if we have an objective market.
<unk>ress is that there's no parkinson and other movements don't have a biomarker, so you can't just a simple biomarks. That's the 20 minutes.
You have to him in the clinics. It's very expensive, and it means that means that means that never gets a clinical studies. No.
But what if patients could do is to make these tests?
That would be a decision in hospital tours in the hospital. What if patients could make these test self?
It wouldn't be a teural hospital.
It costs 300 percent of the neurological approach in the neurological approach.
So I want to tell you a unkonventional Methode, with the idea that we're trying to reach the senses. Because we're all of my record, virtual, Virtuo.
Here you see a video of video of video.
This is happening in the entire condition, if someone's going to be able to look at the stimul ballettle, because we have to look at all of these voice, because we have to coordinate all of these voice, and we all have to do the game.
And as Balletting it's enormously a lot of survey.
Think about how long a child, like long a child, until it.
And by the loud of the position of the vibrating vibrating stimulate cheaps, and as the stimmorgane of Parkinson.
And on the example of the recording of an example of uncomfortable voice.
We see this same symptoms.
Stimes, swallow, swallow.
The language is so living with the time, and it's a example of this, and that's an example of it.
And this expectations, the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphone and presciples of microphoney, combined with new laware, combined with new large, we can move with new large, we can now.
How can these tests with clinical messages? Well, they're not both-invasive. The test.
The same thing. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. There's not going to be the voice of experts.
So you can make yourself.
They're very quickly, three times 30 seconds.
They're very billig and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also use it in big mass.
And this amazing cells, we can now reach this.
We can reduce logistic change for patients.
Patients don't have to leave in the clinics in clinics.
We can record if we can record approaching power.
We can make a crime massive massive studies for clinical studies, and first of the whole population of all the population of the entire population.
We now have the opportunity to look at Biomarkers for the biomarkers for the disease.
Today, we're doing this room, we started starting the parkinson's sunlight.
With Aculab and patients LikeMeeech, we would like a very high number of voices to stimulate enough to bring enough to the exciting of these goals.
We have rooms that are dreaming the dreived by a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, or without Parkinson, can be recorded to record a few center to a few center to a few center. I've been known as a center of our goal process.
Thank you.
If you say, if you say 10,000 people, you can say, who's going to say who isn't it?
What's going to do with all these problems?
What's happened is that the patients of the attack of the parkinson's living to parket or not. Okay. Okay.
Some of them may not be able to create the end.
But we're slowly a huge database, under different environments, which is important. These are important. And we're important, because we're able to immediately the real marker.
On the time, their 86 percent of their 86 percent of the skills?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to love him because he's so fantastic works -- now has been working on the mobilk, it's also working about the mobilknetic works, which is what this project.
That's what I call a connection.
This means that people can do -- people can do with the handyron and the test. Parkinson could do with Parkinson could take their voice, so that their voice, so that you can take the doctor of the disease of the disease of the disease.
Good.
Thank you. Max Little, my dad, my dames and gentlemen!
Thank you.
Here's live in Kenya at Cenyairobi Nairobi Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the cows is the nairobi Nairobi Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the south of just in the south of the southern, which means that we can lose the park of every single time.
The reason that the solve, the solve, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our vieties.
This is one of our kitchen that was killed. I wake up. I wake up and found it was great. It was a bit. It was our only box.
My stamm that stamm of the Massai, we think we're going together with our animals and the website of the handle of the himmeless.
I learned to eather than children.
Our warrior warrior, you know, you're decided our stamm and our hearts. They're actually brought this problem.
and kill the solve.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a national parkets in National Parkets just so few lions.
In my stamm is a junny between six years, and new years for the cows of his father. So it was also.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fewers. Lions. Lions for mechane.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to see the lions that are better.
But I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a vogel.
I wanted to think the solve, I thought I was still the cow.
But solve are very clean.
They're going to see the vogels and go back. Because the next time, but they're going to come and say, "I'm not going to go.
And they're done and killed our viety.
One night, I watched the stall. I love with a fackel in the hand, and this time, and this time, and this time.
Lions for me, light, the light, that's moving.
I had an idea.
I was a little boy worked on my room, I was working all day in my room and took my room, and I took my mother. And I had took my mother. But I had a lot of electronics. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took a old car, and I took a car, and a relationship of a motorrad. The left or left, whether you want to read. He's blind.
And I was born a shalter to me a switch and out of a bit of a bit.
This is a little birth of a captain task of a captain.
And then I built everything.
The solar panel laterials that the battery that battery, the battery, I call it a transformator. I call it a transformator.
And the range of the right.
You can see that the birth, because of the birth, because of the solve.
And this is what it looks like when they come from the solution.
The lights and the lights and the lions that I'm going to believe that I was all the time.
Thank you.
I've been so installed installed and since we didn't have a problems.
And then our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and they asked me, and she asked me if I could ask her light.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
And so I've seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good.
My idea is going to use in all Kenya, also for other radio, also for other rich or Leopardens or Leoparth. The lights. The lights of farms.
My experience to me, a stip to a stipendium in Kenya, Brookhouse in Kenya, Brookhouse international school, and I'm really excited to be in Cenya.
My new schools are engaged and helped up and helping them.
I even have my friends with my friends with home and grandchildren install, we don't have the lights there, and I'm going to show you how to use them.
I just a year ago, a boy from Savanne, who was the boy of his flying. I saw myself, and I said, "I'm going to look at me and said, "I'm going to sit in a sit."
And here's where I'm going to do.
I thought I was in airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm going to be airplane, and Pilot will be my great traum. That's my great traum.
I have a lions I've got lions. But through my experience, I can return the cows of my father and the solve of my father, and we can live without side, without the lions, without the lions without street.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language means that: I thank you very much.
You know, you don't know how long you hear about how to hear a story like your story.
So you've got this stipendium. Yes.
You work on other electrical experiences.
What's the next on the list?
My next experience, now I work on a electrical country, and a electrical country?
Yes, I know, electrical cases are already long, but I want to found my own.
You've got to read it, it's trying to try to try to get out, but I've trying to give you a bit, because I was trying to get a shadow.
All the beginning is hard. Richard Turere, you're a little bit of the best.
We're going to be able to get your way to fire, my friends.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm old enough, a camera in the hand, is photography my passion. But today, I want to share with you 15 of my favorite, and I've been doing a single pictures.
There was no way of Director, no style, no chance to be a picture of a picture. Not only the picture of the moment.
To being able to be able to be able to be able to come from tourists.
My story begins when I started to a talk to a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, on my daughter on my arm, and we were on my arm. We were on my arm. We were on the Eckeyth of 57 and 57th.
And then a year later, we were returned back in New York and so we decided to be simple image.
Well, you can see what you can see.
When the third birthday, my wife said, "Hey, why, why, why, why, why don't you're not going to New York and makes it a father-Tochter-Tochter-Tochter-They,"
And then we started to make a picture of animals, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's pretty much like universe is the lawyer is when you're going to be a volunteera.
Nobody has ever said someone who's never been lucky, and fortunate someone with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rises of our lives.
This journey is very hard today.
This was only after the 11st center, and I had to explain what happened to do, and I had to explain what happens was that a five-year-old it.
These images are much more than just a funny moment, or a certain rise.
They're also for us to be a week for a week in the october, and how we change our time and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical but in everything in everything.
Because even though we do this same image, changes our perspective of mal. While they always reach new miles, I'm always seeing new miles, I'm going to see how they see it.
These very intense, we spend together with each other, and every year we've been expecting and every year.
Last, while after a our risk, we went to a suddenly basically basically, they're going to show them how they're going to show a red market on a rock of a pupplices, they were like a little kid, at a small children.
And she told me about her feelings that she had been five-year-olds of these smallests.
She said that she remember how their hearts from the breast, when she was late new years ago, when she saw the first time.
And now she looked at New York to High schools because they want to study in New York.
And I realized, I realized, the most important thing we all created.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you, an active role in the most expective results of memory.
I don't know how it looks like this, but it's going to look at this 15 pictures, I'm on a family.
I'm always the picture.
I want to tell you everybody today today with the image and getting youn't get someone educate, "Would you do a picture of us?"
Thank you.
