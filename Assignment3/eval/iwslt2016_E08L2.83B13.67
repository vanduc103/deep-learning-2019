When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clength of the clenging frequently.
My father heards his little bit, women radio the news of the brights of the BBC.
He looked very happy, very happy, which was pretty unusual, because they were the news.
He called, "The Taliban are familiar!"
I didn't know what that means, but it made my father, I didn't really happy.
"You can go to a right school," he said, "It's go.
The morning I'm never forget.
All right school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and they spent a girl, and they spent girls.
So I was able to disclude, I five years long as Junge and I started my older sister, who didn't go to away from a swimming school.
And so we could go to school to school.
Every day, we took a different way, even though, even we could never went to where we went to where we went.
We're hidden our books in the left, so we could go out of this, so we just walked out of a sell.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small wohnzimmer.
In the winter was, but in the summer, but in the summer, it's incredible.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
And then the first time, the first suddenly, the biggest, because the taliban constants, because the taliban consistent.
We were never safe, as much they knew about us.
Do they reflect us?
When do they know where we were?
We had angry, but we wanted to go to school.
I had lucky in a family in a family, in education as important and turned to be daughter.
My grandfather was his time.
At the outside of a provinced provincial provinced Afghanistan. He was to school -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and I was sended by his father.
My distributed mother, but it became teachers.
That's what they're.
Two years ago, they went to the rhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here was the first one in his family, who ever received a school picture.
For him, it was clear that his kids would be a children, also his kids, even his daughter, dead, deadly, drop.
He looked like a much bigger risk of his kids, his kids don't go to school.
I know that I'm just exactly the years, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, from our lives, from our lives, from our lives,
I had good loss, I had to give me. But my father said, "The can lose your life. You can lose your life.
His money can be carbon. You can be done in war. You can be done in war.
But a thing that's going to always being, and that's what's going to do with our blood for your blood for your blood for your schools, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I'm in a country, the war.
Less than 6 percent of my age of women's have a higher a higher after the secondary school. And if my family, and if my family, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm standing here, as a stolved Absolventin of the Middlebury College.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was my grandfather, because he was daughter, because he was a greater to school, who was the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first.
He doesn't just talk to my high school, but also, I was also the first woman, and I was the first woman who was the first woman who was food.
My family believe me.
I have great dreams, but my family has larger animals for me.
So I'm a global both of global both of the world's world for 1010, a global campaign for the education of women.
So I've been helped, SOLA to green, and maybe some internative in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country, a country, in the schoolbook.
It's wonderful to see how the shoes of my school with great leadership with great ears.
And to see how their parents and varians for them, like this, and I'm also my parents for me, and I decided everything.
So as Ahmed. That's not his name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
And he was a month ago, and he's been on the home of SOLA in their village, and they're the death, and they're just about a bombs.
When he was home, he came to home the phone and a voice, he would be a voice, he would be able to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "The guys, if you want to be, but I'm not going to be the future of my daughter on playing my daughters and overholds."
What Afghanistan, so I realized something that I realized something that's going to be able to do, most often, most of us who have a father who's a father who's a father who's the wood, and the explane.
That's not today that our mothers don't play a little bit of the success.
These are the people who are harmers who are harm that are possible for a lot of possible for a lot of powerful future out of their tills. But in a society like the men's unfortable.
The Taliban was just a few hundreds of hundreds of girls -- because it was some illegal.
But today, everyone in Afghanistances about three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how we're doing this.
I'm notice that the change of the change of daughters, and they're changing all changes.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I'm the schools in my school, and their parents that they're going to take a lot of themselves, and then I see a lot of parents that they see a lot of parent and a long-termany wall.
Afghanistan is for me to a country of hope and the unfortunities, and it remember every day, and I remember the girls who are looking at the SOLA.
And I think they have great trees.
Thank you very much.
All I do what I do, also, I've been done -- my life -- my life was done by working in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1971 to 197 -- I'm slowly -- I'm in Sambia, Kenya, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria and Somalia, algeria, and Somalia, with African countries.
I've been working for a Italian NRO, and every single project that we put on the legs, we're standing on the legs.
I was sentence.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did all of what we did.
Our first project, what I first project, "Ripples of the book "Ripples inspired," was one that we wanted to show you how nambias, like nutrition.
We came with Italian Saatgut in South America, in this to South Bia, which is leading to Sambesi Flussian population. We lived the animian population and domata and Zucini.
Of course, the answer had no interest inside, so we didn't pay attention, and sometimes they didn't pay for the work.
We were amazing that there was no country in a such an economy.
But instead of wonder why they didn't look at the same, we said, "God"
"Govery," to return the people to save the people to save the people."
Of course, all wonderful in Africa.
We had these practice tomates. In Italia, they were so big, in Sambia so big,
We couldn't believe it and said, "Shouse," and they said, "Shouse."
When the domata, and red, came over night about 200 nights from the flower, and they wondered everything.
We said to the Sambian: "Oh God, the Nilpfering!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a country here."
"Why didn't say, "You know what?" "You've never been asked us."
I thought, we were so greater, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, which was doing what the Englands, which was made the financials. Nothing, I was quite states, I was quite strong in our project.
We felt the nilks to the nilproducing.
They should see the universal -- you should see the university we don't see the uncertainly acrossss the same African people.
They should be the book "Thead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo. It's a sambic economic economy.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have the countries have been done in African continent 1.5 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been telling you what this money.
Let's just going to be a book.
Les you know about an African, which we have anger story.
We're affordable people are imperialists, colonialists, and there's only two species like we're going to patrize them or we're patriarchalical.
Both words, from the latinic went to "pather" which means "Vather" means "Father" means "Vather"
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalic: I'm treating anyone else, as if they were my children. "I love my kids."
Patronizing: I'm treating anyone else, as if they were my dying my dyeries.
That's white people in Africa, "bwana," Chef, Chef, Chef,
I was a growth, when I was the book "Small" by school," from school, and he said, "They, everything in economy when people don't want to go to the rhead.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is Respe.
Today, the morning of the heart of the conference, which is a stab on the ground, and asked, "Can you're going to be a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react on people, and he's going to react a system called companies, never motivated something initiated, no one ever will ever be motivated, but you're going to be distribution, but you're going to be hear the districtionaries of the pionaries that the p
What you do -- you're doing -- you're going to be the mouth.
You never might never get a community with ideas, you're going together with the individuals.
We don't work from books.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Caf."
We have no infrastructure.
We fly flying friends and find out what the person wants to find out what person wants to find.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can someone else, someone can be a idea.
If these person doesn't like this?
The passion for the own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own growth is the most important thing.
We help them to find the knowledge that can never be able to find anyone can be successful.
The person with the idea hasn't knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this unfall: Why, why do you want to tell you what they should do, why do we hear them? But why don't we hear them? But not in community.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
Internation, never have never been part of the public, and they're going to say what they want to do with their money, what they're seeing.
Planation has this blind flow.
The clearly people who don't know the community, because they never met them.
We're working to do this to do this, to do this, you have to do this social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new records to be a new box.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedroom, who's house with you in your cocks, and in the coffe, you help you help you help you to find your passion to transform your passion to transform your passion.
I have this in the food, West-Australia, trying to try to do this.
I promoved to the time and tried to get out of time and tried to decided to do what they should do,
And so I love in the first year, and I had just walked into the first year and I had my first customers, and I half of my first customers, and he was mori. I was Maori. I him, he was a restaurant. I himself in Perthers and he went to get a restaurant.
I half these fishers, and I'm going to work and working together, and I don't think about a factory in Albany for 60 cents, but for 60 cents, but after Japanese for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government, the government, "How do you do this?
How do you do. I said, "I do something very, very, very, very, very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and highly high."
So -- -- so -- so the government, "Mach it again."
We've done it in 300 community.
We've got 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be able to go.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, story, story, story, starting with 96.
Peter pressure was Philosophy professor, before he was businessed with companies. Peter pressure, Peter pressure, Peter pressure, in fact, in fact, and the economy."
Planation is the death of death,
So you built the christian without knowing what the classrooms covered human christian crime and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get this.
You have to give them discretion and privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 keps.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
For example, what presentation have you today, you're morning?
<unk>romic, easy, people have applications. They have applications.
I want to tell you that companies are the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- norrowing fossil fossil fuels, fuels, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The connection of the powerful thing is not sustainable.
The Freon-Aron-Arator is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we look at the same billion people on the sustainable ways to recognize, transportation, transportation, and they can correspond to them.
The technologies don't existing.
Who will this technology for the green revolution? Universities? We're going to be able to eat!
The government? Do you go.
It's going to be investigate. And they're going to do it now.
I read a future story in a future of a future of many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were actually the einglements that were the future of New York in the city of New York in the year.
In 1860, they came together and speculated what happened in 100 years, and the city was going to happen in 100 years. The city: The city was a security: The city wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? You saw the curve, and they said, if the population in this tempoint in this tempoints, they needed six millions of people to stop the people to listen to people who are impossible to millions of six millions of six millions.
Because they went to the master.
At 1860, they see the hard technology that life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there was 1001, there were 1001 cars -- 1001, 1001.
The idea that I had a different technology, the render, and there was little bit little fabrics in the backgrics in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with companies.
And when he's got to be able to be able to be able to be both.
They don't get them and talk to you and talk to you.
And when you have to follow them together, engaged and empty service.
Then you have to district the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the little bit to the biggest company, all the countage, three things out of the course, three things that needs to be able to sell the consumption, and it has to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
Rather?
We never met a single person who can make a single person who can produce the same time, and they can buy the money.
That's not something exists.
This person was born nobody was born.
We have researchers and we've been looking at 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Fording, Ford the new companies, Google, Google, Yahoogle, Yoogle, yoogle, yoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed all the successful companies of the world, only one: No one: No one person, just one person.
Now, we live 16-year-old in Northumberland United States and we started the first two side of Richard Bransons Autobiography, and the first two side of Richard Branson Autobiography. The first one of the first one side of the first side of the first side of the first side
No one, "ich" and 32 times "wir"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody's a company. No one company. No one.
So can we make a community, in the past, which is a little bit of painting a little bit of memory, in Caf<unk>s and bars, and your engaged caf." They're going to do what someone who's going to do about this gentleman, which has done to talk about this guy.
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you record on the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't you." "Mo young someone for you?"
We're activate generate communities.
We have groups of freedoms that can be service the companies that can be underwins, and people who are able to help them. We've found that the wonderful population of the intelligence of the economy and economy of the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be able to be alice in the wonderful.
The Penn State University bather -- a docentin for communication -- attention to communication --
I had angry --
It's not really afraid of these students with their great brains and their great brains and their books and their books and their books.
But as if the conversation, he developed me as alice as an alice as they were going to go to the cannin, and a door to a whole new world.
I felt like I felt when I was talking about the students with the students. I was amazing about the thought they had been discovered that they had this wonderful, and I wanted to discovered this wonder.
I think that to open this door to open this door, it's great communication.
We need to be unbelieved in our scientists and engineering scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that our biggest problems, like, like, for example, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it. I think it's nothing about our responsibility as a responsibility as a responsib
But these great conversation doesn't come to understand our scientists and engineers and engineers,
So scientists and engineers and engineers, clearly, clearly.
I want to show you a few answer, how you can see it, how you can see that the science and technology, and the technology, and the technology and planet, sexy and span you're going to be sexy and plan.
The first question that you have to responsible, is, and?
Says us, why we're just a scientific relevantage is so relevant for us.
Saybe not only that their drawings, but they say that their draws us to tell us that their draws that their draws in our bone, because they're important, because they can understand the Eastoporosis, and they can understand the Eastoporosis.
And if you're going to be what you do, then you're going to be distributed.
Faching minds are a hinder of least,
And so, you could use their doctors and pretty much, but why doesn't say, "Raum and why don't you just understand what much changes us?
Our thoughts to make sure, it's not the same as their nive looks like their nive looks like their nive.
As an amazing thing said, "Macheaches the things that simple as possible -- but not just as possible."
You can tell us something about you, something about you know, you know, you can tell you about it, without anything without the compromise.
A few things are happy to be returned to be careful, stories and analogies, and analogies.
And if you're working on your work, then you read the story, the story.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stichpunct"?
What happens when someone else is going to be a different? A differently, and you're going to be able to do with these points.
A following as this is not just long, but also too much, but also too much on the language of our brains and dading the brain, and we're fast.
These example of geneview Brown is much we can see that the special structure of the tracle of the trabele structure of the traveledge of the traveledge of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect.
The trick here is a single one, just a single sentence, just to use the audience, when it's audience, if it can lose the rest of images and graphics, and the other senses that we can also change our other senses and capture out what we're going to doing.
These are just a few answer that can help us to open this door, and the wonderlands and the wonderful and technology in itself.
And the engineers I've been strong, I've been abuse told me to the <unk>Nerd in me," I want to make all kinds of contact with a same thing.
It's a lot of euroscience, and eure stories, and your father, and you're participants, so that's important, and multiplicated the audience, and multiplicated the same thing that you're incredible working on it. And it's unbelievable working. And it's un
So scientists and engineers and engineers, if you're going to be able to get me inside me.
Thank you very much.
Hi. That's my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy can you a cell phone in Syria, you can films.
With a handy can tweet a news and a protestail and a protestail.
And with a handy can take a song, you can take a song, it's going to be remote.
All of that is possible.
I'm a year 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people for change for change in the streets and the streets.
We're in the herfore 1989, and we're all these people who had changed ones and change changes.
Who is a handy has a handy?
Hold it high.
Hold your hand phone, you hold them!
Hold it high. One Android, a blackberry, wow.
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my hand, and my hand, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 350 ciles of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U. Commission is a relines.
This relinie called Rightliniety is called relined power.
These directly, that every telephone has to be part of Europe, everyone in Europe, every Internet, every Internet Europe, a bandbreaker information.
Who is it? Who do you know? Who is a email?
Who wonderful a sMS?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years to two years of your telephone or your telephone or your Internetanbiety or your Internetanbie.
And everywhere in Europe, people have said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to."
They said, we wanted to do this idea of presence.
We want to be self-based in digital time and we don't want to be the telephone and Internet, and we don't want to talk about us about us species about us species about us.
There was an advice, Journalists, Preester, who all said, "That's not going to do."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of blindlin streets and said, "Freeity states."
And some of those said, this could be the stasi 2.0.
The stasi was the secretsian in Ostdepolice.
And I asked me, if that really works.
Can you really all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone, I asked my phone, the distinction that was the largest telephone, and I was asked to be, and I asked her, and I asked her to me, and I asked her told me about me.
And I asked them, and she asked them, and they didn't get a right answer. Nururur leadership.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is protocollated.
So I decided to do a general important, they wanted to have a bit of information because I wanted to have this information.
But the definit telecom said, no, no, we'll be able to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a compare with them.
I'm going back to the final, where they all send me all the information.
Because in the fundamental pounds of the minute of the emotion of the emotion of the E.U.
So I tell you this half approach to a CD.
And on the CD was this.
350 ciles information.
First, I saw it, and I said, it's half a huge date dategy.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this dateift.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I start with this?
Because you see where I'm where I'm where I'm going to do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show you what imagination means is relative.
So with time opened, and open Data City, so I did this here.
This is a visualization of six months of six months of my life.
You can reincoomes and rausciooms, you can predict and return back.
You can do every step, you can do, after all.
And you can see how I can see from Frankfurt with the stuff to Kills, and how many antswer, and how many ants.
All of that information is possible.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just like, I call my wife and she called me, and we talk to some mal with each other.
And then I called a few friends and they call them a couple of friends.
And after a while you and you call it and you call this huge communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they can communicate apartment to bed them to bed.
You can see all.
You can see the central figures, about who are the leaders of the groups.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect event definitely, as you can see a society, because you know who you can talk to you who know who is a email, everything that's possible when you have access to this information.
And these information are going to be security for months, in European, in Europe to 2 years.
As I said, we said, we're going to imagine all these people in the streets in the streets in the history in the honey in their tasks.
And the stasi, who had been wonstration, who was going to have been wonstration, and if the state of the state, who would never have been going to be the leaders, then maybe this maybe.
The case of the blinder magazine magazine might not be states.
And also, not the case of the case of the ice.
Because today, because of course, and companies like many information, like many information, like they can go overline and often, online and often.
They want to have the opportunity to have our lives, and they want to be able to remain the long long long long long long long long long long long.
But even self-bestimation and a life in digital time in the digital time.
But you have to fight for the self-based for the self-dime.
They have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you go home, you say that Privacy is a value of 21st century, and that's not old, and that's not old.
If you go home, you go home, you're going to tell your eyes and state, because companies have to species, they have to specifically, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think you're asking your phone, you've been talking about you've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you use your handy, you remember the self-bestiment, you need to get the same time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoes, snellrestaurants, bridge, breaks.
So the city planer terrified and overlegral, the name South Central to change something else, so they change it in South Los Angeles, as if it's something that changes the city of what's going to do.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituoes, snow-based, breaks, breaks.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the home of Drivian, the drive-thrus and the Drive-bys.
The comic is that the drive-thrus more people killed than the Drive bys.
People survival Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The fatheries in my father is pretty much in my fourth is higher than about 15 kilometers, which is about 15 kilometers.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how you feel like you wouldn't feel like you couldn't have access to healthy if you could see any time you go out of the house, the negative effects that the best expectations that has been looking at your food system.
I'm going to buy the role of the role and selling, like buyings.
I see the dialysecented realized as starbucks like Starbucks.
And I realized that this is that the way.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no loss, I had no loss to 45 minutes to get a pesticy to get a pestician in the present.
So I plant a food-wood violence of my house.
It's a piece of land, we call Parkanlage.
It's 45 feeters.
The thing is the thing that's the city.
But you have to please it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility and I have to go to the stand up."
And I decided to hold it in Stand.
So I came up and my group, the L.A. Green reason, and we started together, and we started to plant my food, and open, soon, soon, so that all the program, so the whole programs.
We're a kind of imagination, we're used together, all social stories from all social stories and all the city, it's freewillig and all of us, and everything we do, is costless.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else.
The city came up to me and he told me and he said that I had told me that I had told my garden, and he said I had to be a rich, the idea.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A richeral records of food medi-food food medicine, which is true to a piece of land, right?
And I thought, "Cool. Herman."
Because this time, it wouldn't go to the mal.
The LA. Times, Wind, Wind Lopez Lopez, and I spoke a story about it and talked to the city and talk to a member of Green Brazil, and they were able to change a petition, and we were successful.
We thought you're going to hold in the hands.
My city rather rather than and said they were supporting it, and he said they're doing what we do.
So why should they do that?
LA. He's got in the United States, most of the city of the city of the city.
They're bringing 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flower to plant 725 million tomates.
Why wouldn't you shouldn't find that?
And by the beginning of a plant of a plant, you know,000 sames.
With green boards in the value of a dollars, you're going to be own in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my home, I say, I say they should be able to build their own food.
His own food is like your own money is like his own money.
Look, I have a consumption in South Central.
I'm going to stand up there. I have my sons there.
And I'm sured me to be part of this before the reality of the other people who were fabricians, and I fabricians my own reality.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Graffiti-known artists, the walls, the walls, I beautiful, I'm going to beautiful,
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of piece, and the plants are my relationships for these struggle.
They would be surprised what the Earth can use it as a country when you use it as a country.
They can't imagine how it's amazing a sunlume is, and how they touch people are leadership.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden to a instrument for the relationship and the relationship of my fourth.
To change the community to change the collection of the ground.
We're the bottom.
They would be wonderful as kids are going to be confluenced.
Garden is the therapistic and coastic and cool, especially, especially with the city.
And you're going to get the marriage.
I remember this time when these mother, and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30 to me, and they were looking at my garden, and I came out.
I've been easy, because they were really feeling, and I said, "Wis you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I went told me when I saw people looked at me, and I looked at me, and I was just asked me to do it, and I said, "Fin, people wondering, you don't know that people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be there."
And I said, "There's no, no, I don't know what they're not afraid.
And it's to be on the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it back to her healthy."
And I was a different time, I was a garden in this obdddle of Downtown L.A.
These are the guy who have helped me to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how they've been able to see how they've been planted with her mother and her grandmother and her grandmother, and it was to see how it changed for a moment.
Green reason has been done so much about 20 gardens.
To our environments, we got so 50 people and they were all freedom and they're all freedom.
If kids carbon, it's children.
If they cooked tomates, they eat.
But if they don't get anything about it when they're not going to get the food and body eating and body eating them, they're always eating them.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work, but they're standing in this thing -- I see, I see the exactly the same kids who are just going to go on the path, and the next to them.
The gardens, I see a opportunity where we can train these kids can train themselves to care their communities to care after life.
And if we do that, who know who know who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carver Brings.
But if we don't change the collection of the Edbots, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole wanted to plants, where people can share the same flocks in the same flocks.
I want to take schoolscontainer and they're using it in healthy caf<unk>ship.
So, don't understand me.
I'm not talking about costless, because I don't know, because it's not sustainable.
The comics is that you have to behavior,
I'm talking about people, people who are working and children from the streets, and they're going to leave the streets and the streets, if you look at your own food, and if you look at your own food, and if you look at the barmarkers.
So what I want to do here is to do here.
I want to be able to all the ecological rebellire, Gangster, Gangster,
We have to start to turn the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger, you're not a gangster.
Ganger, you're going to sell, right?
And let's get the weapons.
If you want to meet with me, you don't want to tell me if you want to do in the cave and make a meting and a meeting, where you want to talk about what you're talking about it.
If you want to make meet meet you're going to get your garden, so we can do any significantly, so we can plant.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite slowly in the whole oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No ineviticians."
Although in 19th century in 19th century, a better definition, "It's a better definition, someone who is someone who's an independent," which is a capable of parent or line, program or line, and his regularly by the parth or line, and his regramident
I have no idea what "spracheral" is.
Something with World, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all politicians that they need to control the language.
For example, for example, the British Parlament, the British Parlament, time, time, time,
And the thing that was actually back to the mutting of a man with the man with the extraordinary names Brass Crosby, who was crosby,
She was him in the Tower of London and last, but he was muturious enough to be enough enough to enough enough to reach enough, and he was so much difficult to be so much difficult to be so much until the london,
And just a few years later, we find the first next message for the first next message, like Brass" -- Viet.
Brasses are related to the English word for bad.
But that's not true. It's going back to a return to a retroduce.
But to show you how words and politics and politics, I want to take you to the United States, as they're just going to take the unknown.
You saw the question of question, how you should call George Washington, which is to called the state.
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a republican nation?
And that was in Congress, in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible for all kinds of possible.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernor Washington, and other, others, and other, others, and then other, and again, and other people who are in the United States of America, which is America.
Not so that's not a present.
Some people wanted to call him just king it.
They thought that's been done.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the kingdom of time.
It would have been working.
But everyone was indeed, because this distributed, because these data, 3 weeks.
I have the days of a senators who starts to start, "Immerically," "Immerging the same same is the same same is the same same is the same same senators.
The reason for the population and the longer was that the representation was that the representation.
The representants didn't want to do that what's going to do. They wanted to do.
Canighly, and they're going to get it to be possible to be able to bring it.
They wanted to him the most powerful, youngest, youngest titledged them.
This title was "President"
President. They didn't existed the title. He existed. But he was a suffering that someone's been a valuation.
That's how the idea of a Jury.
He didn't have any longer than the record of "Auffer" or "Auff.
Sometimes, there was president little colonial communities and governments, but it was really an indeed, but it was really an unbedded title.
That's why the senating him.
They said, "That's lowerful, you can't call it President.
This closed to be able to turn out and extremely changing and out of citizens.
Who gets him, if he's going to take a thumbs like President of the United States of America?"
And also after 3 weeks, the senates didn't look for three weeks.
Instead of the mind, and we don't want to use the title of the power of the markets, but they wanted to use the powerful, they didn't want to be available respects and methods and methods.
You can learn three interesting things.
First, I think, and I've been able to find out -- until now, whether the senates that had ever been able to find the title president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just been just reflective. He was just about it.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government is something that something temporary -- then you were 223 years later, you know, you were 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is the Titelsident of America," is not so hothly not so hothly clearly not so hard today, right?
This has been able to do something more than 5,000 nuclear possible, and the greatest volcular volcines and a flottom of the world and a flottom of the world and all the stuff.
It's really a story, and story have been given the title.
And so the senates on the end of the end.
They have a respectables of title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of embrace -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the classrooms with the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the senat and the representat and the representation because nobody's never felt that you're going to be the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take me and I decided to do with.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality to control the reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, but actually changed the reality of reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelling campaign for a year -- a 19-year-old, four-year-old surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'd thousands of Converse Halboose Halboose a pairs and country, and celebration in regulation, and they couldn't even see anything I couldn't even see anything I couldn't see anything.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was written with the war, all the war, all the new pyjama-Partys and football playing and footballs and footprints and religion capitalistic southern-state-state data.
But that's the geography of self-driving.
And so I'm going to stand here, well, southern Afghane, Southeists, and atheist and atheist and a radical politized artists who had been working on the last new years in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do a lot of good things about the art, but I don't like to make a personality. I want to make artificial art, and I want to make the personality and cars and cars and cars and cars and cars.
I want to spend a day in life of a vihad -- Gangster, who bring his drawing communists like <unk>Popstar Bling" and pops and popular bubbled and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's going to do is doing the Dihad gangster than the parlament and make a choice and make a choice, and I'm going to do with the slogan: "We'm going to do."
And try to use these campaign to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosiosiosihels.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and I'm going to go back to a project," which you're going to be a policy, and you're going to streets of cable, and they're going to streets and cars.
I want to look at me, like the conflict in Afghanistan of my mind, and I wonflict,
The war and the war and the free-driving answer that with him, and we came up with a new environment for style and models that you can only make a model that you can only collection for skills and self-dime matters, I can create a fashion of fastically cellowledled
And I would like to see how a simple ships from Kabular cabulative cabulative cabulative, and to create a dialogue today about it today, and they're going to create their wildings.
But for all of these things you can get in prison, they can get misciated, they can be missed.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to lose the geography of self-low.
That's my favorite?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I've been working as a model.
Since 10 years, just like, right?
I have the feeling that now is a unfail in space, because I wouldn't have this clearly not to start this clothes.
And lucky, I have something to do something for this.
This is the first time you're the first time you can see someone on the TED book, so you can see, so you can see, so you can see.
If you were really explored, when I was really explored, I need to tell me that I don't need to say that I'm not going to twitter.
I also found that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds, which you think about 10 seconds.
It doesn't have anyone who has chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good, it's good that I didn't want to wear.
The worst part is hardest part of my head, because the pullover, because then you'll all going to all of my head, so long as long as long as head.
In place.
Why did I do this now?
That was possible.
Well, it wasn't so picture as this image.
One is a powerful, but a powerful,
I just have to change your minds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been a friend.
I felt very unfortable, and the photograph, I told my back and I would be solve my hand in the hair, and with my hair.
And then from operations or the false or the wrong breaks that I had two days ago, there are only very few massive ways of our own possibilities, and our own question, and our own life -- even though it's own life -- although it's a big difference -- and it's affective.
It's a hot to be honest today.
And I stand up on this stage because I'm a model.
I asked on this stage because I'm a hill, because I'm a woman who name woman who called a sexy girls.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh," but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, is a model, and maybe a mattery and maybe you're asking, and maybe you're going to ask you.
Well, in the last few centuries, we've been able to beauty and young and young and young, and we're going to be biological programmed, but also, as biological programmed, but also hospital.
This experience was created for me. And it's a recognize for me.
I know there are people in the audience that's audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyray. Joan Smalls. Joan Smalls. Liuan Smalls."
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to leadership.
But I have to tell you that in 2007, that in 2007, a very large dots of NYU.
The next question that I always been always he said, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm going to grow?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls that I want to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all be.
You can be president of the United States or the first inventor of the next Internet or a ninja-Herzchirds or a ninja-dichterin, because then you would be the first."
If they still say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Cameron," I want to say, "Who," I say, "We will say, "Who's my box."
Because I don't have a responsibility for the Chefreditors, and you could be the American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next six melisel.
To say that you want to be a model, you're going to say that you're going to say that you want to win the jackpott in the lotto.
You can't be able to confluence and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years, I'm going to give you away from the other than herzy, because other than herzy, it can only be just fold.
If there's a photograph, and the light, and the light, and the counters, and the century, and the cameron, we want to go to the legs, and then you're going to go to the legs, and then you go to the poor, and then you go to the poor.
It's about this.
Hopefully more communicately than the middle.
That was ... I don't know what's happened.
If you look at school, and if you've done a life, and a few jobs, you can't tell you that you can't tell you that you're going to be a lot of the USA, but in life, "10 years, but you'll go to the United States," you'll go to the code.
The next question that I'm often saying, "Who's retuss all the photos retuss?"
And yes, so pretty much all the photos will be retuss, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is the most picture I made this photo, and that was also the first time I was also the first time I was a biciniode. I hadn't even my periode.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girls.
So I just saw a few months ago, with my grandmother.
This is the day I'm at the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is me on a pyjama Pyjama Party, a few days before a Shooting for the French vogue.
This is me with the football-Team and in the V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
It's constructs and it's constructs of a group of profis, from Haurylists and meters and meters and photographs and stylists and stylists and structure that I'm not construction.
Okay, when you ask me, people ask me, "Creeks?"
Yes, I have many 20-cm-cm-Abs, which I can met never wear, but the things I can met, but the things I've been great, things I'm going to talk about it, things I don't like to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, and one day, I went to a laden and I had my money, and I had gave me the cleid for the cleid for the car.
When I followed to my friends with my friends, a farm, and they were confused to be a redress and of course, we had just a redress, and of course, he needed to do this, and we could just further.
I have this cost of my cost things, and I don't get my personality and not because of my personality and there's people who are people who are paying their personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 parts that were in the last decades, and they were filtered, 85 percent of swarm and latinos and latinos and most of young men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men and latinos, for the question, "Who do I think, "Who do I think about this question?"
And so, "How many often I'm going to turn? When I'm going to start?"
And in my rights for this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers, and these numbers are 178 percent when they're 178 percent.
The last question, "How is it, how does it be a model?"
And I think they're expecting these answer: "If you're going to be a little bit and believe you, you feel very happy and felt very happy and fabulously happy and fabulously happy."
And Backstage we give answer that maybe this impression.
We say, "It's really great, so much to report, and it's greative, inspired, inspired people."
All that's true, but it's just the half of story, because what we never say, "I never say, what I never said, "I feel like, "I feeling me, "I feeling me, "I feeling me."
And I feel like me, because I have to think about my explore every day.
And if you ask you ever ask, "What do I think if I'd be happy if I had you'd believe?"
Then you should meet a few models, because they have the thinest basic legs and the most final harm and the coolest coolest coolest coolest coolest women's the most explanted women on the planet.
When I wasn't this talk, I've been very difficult to me, I've been very difficult picture, because I felt a very unless, because I felt very unfortunately, "I'm going to tell me, "I got all the piece of my grandful." And I was just grandman.
It was very difficult, a very difficult, a supply, and reflective stories, and reflecting a greatest nutrition of the greatest nutrition.
But I'm also happy and feeling, and I'm going to stand up here, and I've been able to do it here, and I've been here before 10 or 30 years ago, and my career, and my career, because I wouldn't be a sense of my career, because I wouldn't really feel like my career.
If you take a little bit of this talk, then hopefully, we all recognize all the powerful successes and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never been able told my grandmother, which is never forget about life, "Son," is, "Son," is, "Son," and they're going to be affected.
But who never never been to something like a gaddafi revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the liby school revolution of revolution, inspired by the waves of the waves of the massive revolution.
I spent me with many other libyers, with many other libyers, and I was able to start a day of the corn and to start a day of the corn and to start a revolution of Gaffis.
And there was a big revolution.
Junge, liby women and men and men are stood in the first rest of the regimes, the end of the regimes, hold slogans of the freedom and social generality.
They've been exampled mutes, by taking themselves by the brutal dictatur Gaddafishing.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the farm, from the farm.
Finally, after a time, after a time of six months and almost 50,000 tote, and almost 50,000 tyranes and the guyranians.
But Gaddafi has a big big big business, a conversation of the Tyrannei, the corruption and the reason for course.
Four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannian regime sowooth the infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the lybical society.
The consciousness and the challenge, I asked, I as many other women, I as many other women who are recording to recognitional lybia. We're going to take a bit of democracy and national experiences.
So to 200 organizations were during and unmediately after the case of Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in the exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasm, I started workshopshopshopshopshops and human development, human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I women's found the peaceplatform Libyscher women, a movement of women, a movement of women, the goal of life, the goal of the public heads, the public head of the public head.
And in the paid I met a very difficult environment, a very difficult environment, which is always stronger politics. A environment, which was dominance and explane and explained.
I was a slide of the peace and a peaceful way to reach a women, and I'm a laws to reach a laws, a law that every bit of citizens, eggal, and that would be citizens and country and care about all the rights and country and country and country and country
And at the end, our initiative, and he's successful.
Women women 17,5 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But long, but it's a long time, the euphory of choice and the whole revolution to news, we waiting for news.
A lot of morning, we went to the meldle of changes and Sufi-grading and Sufi-Grandian.
And one of the other morning, we got news about the Mord at the American bothers and the angriffs on the message.
At the other morning, the morning of officients of the army.
And really, every day, we're going to look at the milize of milize and their others, and their own mission of regularly and their power and laws and laws.
Our society, we found that involutionary mindship, polarized and decided to the ideal and principles and principles, social common, social generality, social skills.
Intolerance, expluse, and Rache and Rache, and Rachecones of the revolution.
I'm not today today today with the successful story of our reversion, and the choice listen and the choice.
For example, I'm going to tell you that we've been able to create a nation that have done.
We've been able told our priorities.
Because the choice, the choice or security or security or security in Lybia.
Hat the remarkable, and the white lists and the white between female and men, and national wars and national female values?
No, it didn't.
What's it?
Why is our society is going to continue our society and dominated by self-f-forest politics, and the explane, and the explanation of men?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been the only female, but the female women's female, the grandman and the idea and the unit of the slight.
Our society needs a national dialog and consensumption, and consensuming the choice, which has just the choice and decision, only the polarization and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative conversation of the female, more than they need the number of the female, quantitative conversation of the female.
We need to stop in the name of the name of the corn and a day of the roach.
We need to start to start to do with the middle and the grandchildren.
We have to develop a female distribution that wouldn't just going to be able to do it, but also too, but also together, instead of collaboratory, considered concerned concerned concerned concerned.
These are the ideal that Ialthy broaded by the war, the warrior crime biology to reach peaceface.
Because the peace has an alchemic and in this alchemics, and it's about the femines and masculines.
This is the real reverse rivers.
And we need to existence existence, before we do it sociopolitical.
After a versa from the Koran "Salam" -- Freece" -- "It's the word of the words, radio."
The word "radition" again, all the abrahamic traditional traditional traditional woman, this is the same as the word "mbolism," and symbolized the woman whole feminal feminal feminal feminal feminal women, and the wholedomanted to the
And just like the motherleible of the embryo, which is completely completely so nutrition of the compassion of the middle of the middle existence.
That's why we said, "My Gnade, all things."
That's why was, "My Gnade," he said, "My Grall."
And so many of us all the point of the gnade.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought, I was the best of the world, and I went to bring the low "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we're going to see the story of Kim Il-Sion, but we learned a lot about the world, except that America, South America, South Korea and Japanese are our fine.
And even though I was often asked me, I thought, I thought, I thought, I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until away.
With they saw years, I saw a public head of a public head, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to live myself.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter a letter of the Swestter of a collegin.
Darin stood, "If you're going to learn our families don't have anymored in this world, because we've been able to be for two weeks.
We're going to start together and our body are so difficult to sure that we're going to die."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time to heard that people in my country.
I went to the bahnhox, and I saw something that I couldn't see something that I can't get anymore.
A living woman woman on the ground, and a above away in their arm, and a half of his arm.
But no one was half of them because all of them were sold to care about itself and their families to care their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hunger.
At the end, more than a million North Koreaner's million Northern Coreans, and many more than they were just because they're reason, and many more than they're basically reason.
In the case, the more and more half after that, so that's been remove me all the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the environment.
I always asked me why they had there, and we didn't have.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors.
This is the flow of Amrocracy, who is the philos of the North Korea and China and China and China and China and China.
As you can see, the river of the flowerful and he's very similar to the flight.
But many survive.
Sometimes, I saw people in the river.
I can't tell you how I can fly, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I can tell you that I was during the hunger, after China.
I thought I thought I was a short time from my family,
I would never have never thought that it was 14 years together again.
In China was very hard to live without girls without family.
I had no idea of how life would be a northern Corean flying, but I would be extremely supposed to be extremely difficult, but I'm not just extremely dangerous. Becored, because it's very dangerously in China.
So I lived in state, I could be able to fly identity, and you would be able to eat, and you would be sended me in a sentence.
One day, my greater alptraum, when I was bigger than I was born from Chinese police and in the police.
Someone who was really important to be north Korean, so they did my chinese country, and they asked me to tell me about my chinese questions.
I had solarly thought I thought my heart, I thought I would explodate.
Would you be somewhatural, I could be ready, I could be eat, and I could be used to be able to be able to be.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I didn't produce my life, but I was able to control the questions.
After they were finished with the example, he said, "That was a false.
It's not a north Korean."
And they love me. It was a wonderful.
Some North Korean, in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and repeating and absolutely.
These girls had great happiness.
And even though they were expected, they were free, they were free international pressure international pressure.
These North Koreanerins didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, some northern Coreaner in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be able to be released or public, efficient or public history.
And even though I had lucky, I had lucky, it's a lot of other northern North Korean.
It's tragic that North Koreanians their identity and hard to survive.
And so they found a new language, and worked a new language, can be found their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the past 10 years, I decided to South Korea, and I started to go to South Korea.
Micha in South Korea, was a bigger challenge, a greater challenge, when I thought it was thought.
English was in South Korea, I had to learned that I had to learned my third language.
And I have the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all the corean, but inside our innoved, we've been very expecting about 67 years of participation.
If I was a identity.
Bin I south or North Koreanerin?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Pludingly, there was no land more, I could have a country that my home.
Although I didn't work on the southern Americ life, I hadn't live a plan.
I'm already for the attention of the university.
And so I was aware of my new life, I had become a box, I would have a bad attack.
The north Korean body, the money, which I family, and I family, and when I was sended my family between my family, and when you're going to be able to the country.
They had to fast as possible as possible, so I started to plan.
North Koreanerans have to be an incredible streets to freedom.
It's almost impossible to required between North Korea, Ironically to China, Ironically to China and made me back to China and made me back to China and made me back to China.
Because my family doesn't have to talk to them to more than 2,000 miles, I had to southerns through China and then after Southeast Asia.
The business is a week, and we were going to be almost almost almost expects.
Once, when the business was a chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the exactly of all and began to ask questions.
And I didn't understood any Chinese family, I thought they would be able to get them.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided told him, and he said that they were taught himself, and I would be since.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, he was happy.
We did it allowed it to the laotic green, but I had to be almost everything I had to borders of Laos.
But even though we had the borders of the border, my family inhaft, because illegal green.
After I had money and switched my family, my family was inside a month, but I was free in a month, my family, my family, my family, in the mainstad of Losa.
This was one of the greatest rid of my life.
I had done all of my family to free my family to free, and we were so narrowed, but my family, just the southern Coreanese Bothorean Bothorean Bothanish Bothorean Bothanish Bothanish Both.
I went to the between the impact between the police and the police and tried to police my family, but I didn't have enough money, but I didn't enough money or money or money or money.
I'm lost all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man who said, "What's los?"
I was fully about this, I was a friendly careful.
In broken English and with a words and with a words, I went to a bank, and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two northern Corean, and two other northern Corean, and two more northern Corean,
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he said, "I don't help you.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The first thing to come from friends, for me to a new hope for me to a new hope that needed to take the North Korean, and he showed me the friends and extraction of friends and the international community as the hope as the northern Northern Core.
Finally, after our long rise, my family, and I read back to South Korea, but the freedom.
Many North Koreanerans are done by their families, and soon as they get in a new country, they're going to get a money or not a money or not a money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us to the English, who are more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the eye, because many of us are still in contact with families, and we're staying them information and money, and we're harming the northerna of the northerna.
I had a lucky, so much hope and inspiration inspiration in my life, I hope to successful northern Coreanians, with international until the International until.
I'm sure you're going to be much more successful North Korean, also, in the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I just have a bit of a bit.
Please say, I'm not a normal.
Now, I want to imagine my bridge.
Remi is 22, great and very good.
He can't talk about, but he can't communicated friends, like some of the best reder.
Remi knows what love is love.
It's particularly expensive, and he shared.
It's not just a little bit. He doesn't look at the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences and imagine, and imagine, and you never tell you a light.
If he looks like our childhood, you know, I tried to remember the words that I remember, he remember one thing: how little we know about the consciousness, and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He's an absolutely unfortable memory.
But he has a slightly selective.
He can't remember if he remember my shocola, but he remember the public, but he remember the public, conversation, and he was four of all the time we had four, as he was fourthy of all the television of my artists on my artists.
Do they don't be incredibly?
But many people don't stimulate.
And in fact, because their understanding of the society of normal pasures, they're often, they're often, they're often.
But what my heart, and my heart and my soul, and my sea was that if this was the case, even though it wasn't approached, but they were just a similarly approached, they were just authorically -- extraordinary -- extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who don't asking you who don't use the pathiff <unk>Autism, it's a complex function of the brain, which is social communication, and sometimes the social communication, and sometimes the skills.
It's also approached in every individual, it's a remium is so different than Sam.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person autism, and even though there's one of the most fastest growth, there's one of the world, there's no known associated or health or health.
And I can't remember the first time I remember autism, but I can't remember, but I can remember it.
I was just three years old, when my brother when my brother, and I was so excited that I was so excited that I had a new words in my life.
And after a few months ago, he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and actually, and actually, in fact, and actually not very interested in me.
Remians lived in his own world, with his own world, with his own rules, and he founds, and he found the little bit of things like, Autos in a series in a series of the room, which is what it was going to eat.
And when he was older, he was different, and the differences were sort of different.
But behind the wood and the fun and the fun and the funny, and the neverage was something really a very unique, a remarkable nature, a junny, a junny who had never been a junny, a human, who had never saw.
And then, it's extraordinary.
Well, I can't learned that there was some of the moments in my family, moments, moments, moments I wished that they were just like me.
But I go back to the thought of the thought they've lead me to the idea that they've been able to understand the communication and love, and I don't understand that these things I don't want to be thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands.
Normality about the beauty that the beauty that we're going to give us, and the fact that we're different, means that we're not going to be different.
It means that there's another way of relatives.
And if I just to say a thing to Remi, and then I could say, and then you wouldn't be normal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have -- we have a story, and we have a story in all earlier, and in all earliers, and in all earliers, the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance on the size, finish and walls in the moment, in the moment where we try to be different.
Please -- you're not saying that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has been required with editor and neuroser to this photo on the project, and a project, and with a million times a million times of seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, and see the world doesn't see the world, but a billion or a billion pictures per seconds.
I'm going to tell you a new kind of photography, the femto-Fotography, a new education that they can make time, so fast, that they can record the time.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the absolutely to look at editors or no picture, or without a beautiful body in our body, and really asking question, which we can ask "Camera" of myself.
If I'm going to take a laser potential, and it's a million skills -- that's more female -- that's more femtoseconds -- I'm a packet of Photon, and this is a billion-partment, and this poton.
So if you take this project, this photones, this photones and take it into these flashion, how are going to behind these photones in the flashing?
How does light look like this?
So, this whole events --
So, think of it, the whole events actually thought that's actually less than a nanoseconds -- so light needs to return this street, but I'm lighting this video to the factor of the factor 10 billion to see the factor of the failiar with the light.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financialized this research.
So, in this movie, so much, so let me show you what happens to you and show you what happens.
The puls, our project, our project, after the flashing with a photonpaketer package, and it's hard to move and the finally.
A part of the lights outside the table, and you see this experience of the waves.
Many of the photones of photons, the last last last last, and exploding the rivers and exploding different directions.
As you can see, there's air bubble that's in the flashing in the flashing.
As the waves are breading to the waves on the table, and because the reflexions of the reflexion of the reflexion of the focussion of the focuss.
If you take a piece of project, and it's the same streets back to the same streets and the video to the factor 10 billion people, you know, how long you have to see the film?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long time -- from a long film -- from a long-term, normal project,
And how does it look like a stillle-fotography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like when you have a sentence in a teach.
I'm going to look like this, as a photo males, the picture of a photo males, but of course, of course, our eye.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the lights, you're going to remove this further. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the tomate is reflection and light in their lights and after a million times a million seconds.
So, in the future, if these femto-camera in your camera in your camera, it could be able to be able to go to a supermarket, and if you can go to a free, whether it's a free, no clean.
So how did my team at MIT this camera?
So, as a photographer, if you're a photographic recently, you have very little light light light, but we're very little billion times a billion times as your citizens, so you get a billion times as good as good as you can't get a light.
So we do this is what we're doing this project, this photones, this photones, millions of times and show them very clever, and then replace and remaining these gigabytes of data, and we've combinate this female, I've give you the fixed to show you the femaleday.
And we can take all these rohdates and doing things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can do that, but how would it be able to do with a new soul of superhels, can see, to see ecks, to see ecks?
The idea is that we're going to streaming something light.
It's going to go back to the room, a part of it, part of it will reflect the door, and we could reflect the camera and we could reflect these more simplic actors.
And that's not science fiction. We've built it.
Links, you see our femto-camera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we'll be able to leave the door.
After our attention in the "Nature Communication" was published by nature, it was by nature, it was from nature.comes.comes.communication.
We're going to be able to recipe and they're going to be able to do this poton, and then we're going to be able to all the directions, and some of the poton and then the hidden will be able to reach the light, and then the puppeared the pupply.
And because we have a camera, so fast is -- our faster, our femto-camera has some single capacity.
It's a very good time, and they can look at the world in light.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the first objects, but we don't know what the points, but we don't know what to do.
Indeed a laser on the laser, we can see a robot, we can see a robot, which -- how they see, but if we see many of these images, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they try together and try together and try together, and they're going to try and try to do this paint
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit of doing this lab, and we can use the laboratory, we can build cars, we can build the collisions that can behind the collisions, or we can see what the course is to look at the courve, or we can see in the lights.
But because of the blood and violence is very, of course, that's why the really bigger for scientists, so that's really a way to think about femto-fotography, there's a new conversation of medical dangerous medicine.
So, as a democracy, even a scientist, even a scientist, and we can't have a art, a artist, and I realized that all of the ultraphy, and I realized that all these gigabytes that we can't just set up all the science of the science.
But it's happening here, something luster.
If you look at these waves under the waves, you see that the waves are moving from us.
The waves should be moving.
What happens here?
It turns out that we're almost in light, because we've almost in light, and insteinein could have seen this image, and incredibly seen this image.
The rules, the rules, in the world, in the world, he's going to happen in the camera in the camera, so you can decide the camera and time you can detect the relationships, we can correctly correction.
So, whether we should be able to create the education or the medical truthorities, and we've got to remove the medicine or new data, we all have data and data, we allowed to open up our ways.
It's about time. Thank you. Thank you.
There are many ways of our lives, like our opportunities.
We don't meet any neighbors on the street, so many ways, so many ways, but we're going to use this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and stuff, things like aircle, snails and circle, snowing and create.
The projects from my questions, how much maybe my questions, how much might be my neighbors?
How can we stop more things to stop, without us, without us?
How can we relate our memory to share our memory and the country and the country?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so that our communities, so that our communities and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea is going to be report by the huge easy, the hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds and trees, and I'm going to talk about a city, and I've always talking about music.
I think every time, every time, anyone nobody nobody, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the city with most reason.
If I stayed this house, and I've been able to change how I could change it. I thought I was going to change my life for everything that I was changed my life for everybody.
In 2009, I was lost someone I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death. You suddenly and unexpected.
I've been thinking about death, and I was a great disease for my life, and I brought me to my life, and I needed to be the things that are important.
But it's hard to me, these sort of evidence every day.
It's easy to lose in the Alltagine and lose what really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I wrote a side of the house, and I wrote a huge tail and wrote the lucky, "Bevorite, I want to take away." Jer who can take a piece of crowds, I can take a piece.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to experiment, but I could expect the next day, the next day, and they're always been filled.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the walls that were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to be sure, I want to be away from piratterns."
"Bevor I want to stand up, I want to stand up international datums."
"Bevor I want to single, I want to singing for millions."
"Bevor I want to sure you a battle."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netzunting."
"Bevor I want to sure them again, I want to hold them in my arms."
"Bevor I want to be sure someone who I want to be someone."
"Bevor I want to be sure I want to be very sure."
This is after all the place was place to a sense of sense, and the hope and trees me to the people who needed me to legs me to the wine and during me, and during me while the hard time.
It's about knowing that you don't know anything.
It's about our neighbors and understanding and second, and it's a new way.
It's about remembers for remember and remembers and remember what we're doing is important, and we're going to change and change ourselves.
I've done this last year, and I've done hundreds of people who wanted to build a wallowledge that could build a wall, and so I wanted to build a building and now I've been building away, and now, and now we've been going to be in Lavestailable, South Africa, Sou
We've been used to be as much powerful places when we have the opportunity to share our voices, and more with other people.
Two of the most people we have, the most people that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with two-bling conditions, it's important than young people with the right blend, and thinking that life is course, and it's a short and realize that life is course.
We're often distribution to talk about death, or even to think about the death or even though I realized that the idea that the idea of death is one of the death is one of the things that most strong us.
The thought of the death, the death is using life.
Our common practice, which is the best, which is important to us as individuals and as individuals, and more importantly, and more possibilities, and stories can't help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to turn me with a mathematics. A particular problem for everyone who are connected to each other mathematics, is that we are as companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you about today, I'm going to explain what I do.
Tancing is one of the most human activities.
We're decided to be approach of most of most half-down balletts and soups, like you're going to see.
For ballettles a extraordinary great markets, and ability to capacity, and possibilities, and possible evention that could have a genetic completely a genetic completely.
Tradually, destroyed neurological stories like Parkinson long-terminson, and that makes them to my parkets, and that makes them to be a ballettuose.
And over the years, you've been doing a lot of research in the mistakes.
Trotzdement, there's a world's 63 million people who are living in this disease, and they need to be infinitely symptoms like symptoms, symptoms, and more living disease, and more living disease, whether we need to make the disease.
We have to measure the research if we can measure, and last, and last, really, really, really, really, if we have a single possibility, if we have an objective massive market.
<unk>rather is that there's no parkinson and other movements don't have biomarkers, so you can't just a simple biombs. That's the best thing that we can do is this 20 minutes.
You have to turn it into clinics. It's very expensive, and it means that means that means that never gets a clinical studies. No.
But what if patients could do if patients could do?
That would be a decision in hospital tours in hospital. What if patients could make these test themselves?
It wouldn't be a teures hospital.
It costs 300 percent, 300 percent, in the neurological approach.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods, with the idea that we're trying to do this. Because we all are, because we all are, in a sense of the senses like my recognize as my recognize.
Here you see a video of video of video.
This is happening in the entire condition when someone lawyers. We can look at our stimul ballettle, because we can look at all these voice because we have to coordinate all these voice, and we all have to do the game.
And as Ballets, it's enormously a lot of exercise.
Think about how long a child, until it to speak.
And by the louds, we can use the position of vibrates. And as the green. And as the certainly, and as the voice of Parkinson.
And on the undergrading memory, you can see an example of unregular voice.
We see this same symptoms.
Voice, swimmor, sister, switch.
The language will be easier with the time and it's an example of this.
And these effects of the voice, sometimes can be minimal, but sometimes, sometimes, and presentize the present-shimmanalyse, combined with new learning, combined with new learning, which is very critical learning.
How can these tests with clinical messages? Well, they're not both-invasive. The tests.
They're not going to be. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. There's not going to be the voice.
So you can be constantly by leadership.
They're very quickly, three times 30 seconds.
They're very billig and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also use it in great massive.
And this amazing reaches, we can now do this.
We can reduce logistic swimming for patients.
Patients don't have to leave a routine control of clinics.
We can recognize whether we can recognition.
We can make a massive massive massive massive studies and remote and first of all the population of the whole population of all the population.
We now have the opportunity to look at Biomarkers for the disease for the disease, before it's too late it.
Today, we're doing the first step in this direction, we started the parkinson's settimms.
With Aculab and patients LikeMeeech, we want to take a very high number of voices to stimulate enough explore the exciting of these goals.
We have rooms that dreams that dreivilized a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, or without Parkinson, can be fighting a few center to a few center to a few center. I'll known to be able to get a couple of our goal process.
Thank you.
If you say, if you say 10,000 people, you can tell you, who say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What do you do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients have to give you approach to park if this parkinson's living or not. Okay. Okay.
Some of them maybe not being until the end.
But we collect a huge database, different database, different environments, which is important. These are important, because we're important, because we're able to make these extraordinary marker.
For example, their 86 percent of their 86 percent of the skill?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to love him because he has to be fantastic worked -- now has to be fantastic works, but now it's also working about the mobil function, which is what this project, and we're incredible, and we're at 99 percent.
That's what I call a connection.
This means that people can do -- people can do with the handy, and people can do with Parkinson could do with Parkinson could take their voice, so they can take their voice, so that you can take the research on the research.
Good.
Thank you very much. Max Little, my dames and gentlemen!
Thank you.
Here I live in Kenya, I live in Kenyairobi national Park.
In the background, you see the kitchen of my father and the kitchen, and the nairobi nairobi national park.
The Nairobi national Park is just in the south of justice, just in the south of the parkets. That means that wildlife as crosss the park every single time.
The reason that the solve, the solution, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our vieties.
This is one of our kitchen that was killed. I wake up. I wake up and found it was great. It was a great box. It was our only box.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we think we're going together with our animals and the website of the sky. That's why we're doing so much.
I learned to eather than kids.
Our warrior warrior, you're investigators. They're actually cutting our hearts. They're actually going to be away from this problem.
and kill the solution.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a nairobi- National Park, just so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few lions
In my stamm is a junny between six years, and new years for the kitchen for the kitchen. So it was also.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire idea was fire. Lions for mechane.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to see the lions that are better.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a bird idea.
I wanted to think the solution I thought I was still the cow.
But solve are very clean animals.
They come to see the birds and go back. Because the next time. But they come and say, "I don't get it, and they're still not yes.
And they're doubts and killed our vieties.
One night, I watched the stall. I love with a fackle in the hand around him and this time, and this time.
Lions for me, light, the light, which is moving.
I had an idea.
I was a little boy, I worked all day in my room, and I took after my room and took my mother roadio of my mother. And I had a lot of my mother. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took a old car, and I took a motorrady and a motorrad. The left or left, whether you want to read or left. He's blind.
And I was a shalter, told me a switch and out of a switch.
This is a little birth of a birne of a captain task.
And then I built everything.
The solar panels that the battery, the battery, the battery, I call it a transformator. I call it a transformator.
And the relationships.
You see that the births, because of the birth, because of the solve.
And so it looks like this for the solution when they come.
The light blink and the lights and the solution I'm going to believe that I was all the time.
Thank you.
I have this home installed this way, and I wasn't have a problems.
And then we heard our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had many of their animals, and they were lost their animals and she asked me if I could ask her lights installing.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
And so I've seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights and they work really good.
My idea is used to be used in all the cenia, also for other regularly like Hyenopars or Leoparth, and the lights of farms.
My experience to me, a stipend to a stipendium in Kenya, Brookhouse in Kenya, Brookhouse international school, and I'm really excited to be in Cenya, and I'm really starting to a stip.
My new schools engaged and helps themselves through language and reclationships.
I even have my friends with home, and I've been broke and common installing the lights there, and I'm going to show you where you're not going to use them.
I just a year ago, I just a boy who was a boy who was hoping his flying. I saw airplane, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a sit."
And here's where I'm going to stand.
I thought I was invited with a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm going to be airplane, and pilot will be my great dream. That's my great dream.
From the river, I can go through my experience, but through my father, I can return the cows and the solution, and we can go to the side, side of the side, without the side, without the solve street.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language means that, I thank you very much.
You know, you don't know how long you're not to hear a story like your story like yourself.
So you've got this stipends now. Yes.
You work on other electrical experiences.
What's the next on the list?
My next experience, now I work on a electrical country, and a electrical caunch?
Yes, I know, electrical cities are already long, but I want to found my own.
You've got to read it, you know, not trying to try to give you a little bit, but I've trying to give you a snowledge, because I got a shadow.
All the beginning is hard. Richard Turere, you're a little bit of special.
We're going to be able to get your way to your friends, my friends.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm old enough to hold a camera in the hand, is photography my passion, but today, I want to share with you 15 of my favorite, and no one of them.
There was no way of Director, no style, no chance, no chance, no chance, no matter. Not even the experience.
To be able to be able to be considered by the most vehicles.
My story begins when I started a talk for a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, I was my daughter on my arm, and we were on my arm. We were on my arm. We were on the Eckeyth and 57th and 57th.
And so a year later, we were back in New York and so we decided to be able to same image.
Well, you can see what you can see, you can see.
When the third birthday, my daughter said, "Hey, why, why, why, why don't you're not going to New York and makes it a father-down-Tochter-Tochter-time ritual?"
And then we started to make a picture of tourists, we started to make a picture of us.
You know, it's pretty much as universe, as universe is when you're going to be a volunteera.
Nobody has ever said, someone has ever been lucky, and fortune, someone with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rises of our lives.
This journey is very hard today.
This is only after the 11th, September 11, and I had to explain what happened to do, which was happening to understand what happens.
These images are much more than just a function, or a particular moment, or a particular journey.
They're also for us to be a week for a week in the october, and how we change our time and how we change our time and how we do in all the time, not just physical, but in all of us.
Because though we do this same image, changes our perspective of mal. While they're always reach new miles, I'm always seeing new miles, and how they see it with all the life with all the way they see it.
These very intense, we spend together with each other, and every year we've been expecting and every year.
Last, while after a risk, we went to a suddenly, and suddenly, they suddenly as they stand up a red market, they showed a red market, they'd like to be a little kids, when they love to love to be a little kids.
