When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clines of the clines.
My fathered on his little bit of his little roadio the nights of the bBC.
He looked very happy to what happy was pretty unusual, because of course, because most of them were mostly deprimated.
He running, "The Taliban.
I didn't know what that means is, but it made my father, but it made my father.
"You can you go to a right school," he said," he said," he said.
The morning I'm never been morning.
One of the right slight.
The Taliban he's the power in Afghanistanistan, and it was six, and it was to go to school.
And so I five years, I five years long as a junch of years, and starts my older, and I didn't go from your sky, not all of your sky.
And so we could go to school.
Every day, we could never seen a different way, so that he could never be able to do where we went to where we went to.
We're going to understand our books in Einking to the left, so we'd just look like this.
We were involved in a house, over 100 million walls in a small wire.
In the winter was after it was in the summer, but in the summer.
We all know that we knew that we knew our lives: teachers, snows our parents.
In the until the until the until the until for a week of weeks because the talible for a week.
We were never been using how much they were about how much they knew about us.
Do they were using?
Why do they know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we know where we're going to know where we're going to know where we do?
We had angry, but we wanted to school.
I had great great happiness in a family to a picture as important as important as important as important.
My grandfather was his time.
At the outside of a values provincinates. He's banding on its older -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and it was to be sended by his father.
My filmed mother, but it was line.
It's it.
Two years ago, they went into the ruhest, only to our house for money and women and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this was the first time -- the first time in his family, who was a school.
For him, it was clear that his children would be a children would be a children, but also his talible, turns out of the Taliban, turns out of all Risk.
He looked like a much larger risk of his children don't go to school.
I know that I know that I know in the years, I'm going to be the day, even three years of our life, from our life, from our lives and the perspective,
I was good lustered today. But my father said, "The said, "They life can be in your life.
No money can be done. You can be in the war. You can be in the war.
But a thing is going to be always going to be here: The thing is, and even if we have to be able to your bubble for your bubble to your bubble.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country on a country that was the war of the war.
Women than 6 percent of my alters have a higher than the seconds as the seconds as the seconds. And if my family for my family for my family for my school.
Instead of states, I'm here today, as a struggleburlebury College.
When I was after Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was in his family, because he was family because he was taken his taken to school, and he was a greater.
He doesn't just not just with my hearts with my hearts, but also the first woman who was the first woman who was the first woman with the carbular.
My family globaly.
I have great trees, but my family has stilled a greater animals for me.
So I'm a global bottom of 10-10, a women for 10, a women for 10,
So I've got to be the south, SOLALALALA and maybe some in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country, in the school,
It's wonderful to see how the ships of my shock with great earning all of them all of them.
And to see how their parents and various and variety, as it's also my parents, and it's all the parents.
So as Ahmed. This is not really not being a name and I can't show you, but Ahmed is the father of my father.
And then a months were his taughter and he's been on the home of SOLALALALA in their diction, and they're only only only to get a bombs.
When he was to home, he came to home and a stimply dropsed him, he was going to be fall, he would be far on the shoots, they would try to do it.
And he said, "There's now when you want to do, but I'm not going to be the future of my daughters on the future and older older and older."
What Afghanistanistanistan, so I have something that I've been able to be able to be able to be the most of us, the most experience, the first father, the father, and the water, and the wood is also the first time.
That's not today that our mothers don't have a important role in our experience.
And they're going to be half thejures that are possible for a lot of different future, and over a lot of future. The future of their daughters.
The animaliban went to the talible months -- because it was someone -- because it was someone.
But today, everything in Afghanistanistanistan, the schools.
Afghanistanistan, from America from America, so differently.
The Americans, as well, like us, like us are solutions.
I think that the change that the change is not from daughters and recording to the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistanistan, if I'm going to slince, and their parents, and their parents that they're going to make a lot of parents that I see a lot of future, and then I'm going to slower.
Afghanistan is for me to a country and the unfortunities and the university of allows me to remember every day, and the south.
And as I think they have great trees.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, I'd been created by my life -- my life was in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1971, I see someone -- I'm not -- but I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Cenia, algo, algorithia and Somalia and Somalia, along the technological countries.
I've been working for a nROO, and every single project that we're going to stand up the box.
I was sentence.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people, and good working in Africa list.
Instead of course, we were all doing everything we had to do.
Our first project, what my first project, which is the first book "Ripples from the America, a sambipped to the people, inspiring the same thing that we want to show you how numbias.
We came up with its operating southern South America, in South Abia, which is to the sambi-Flussion. We live. We live in the same talue of the animal talue of the tales and tales.
Of course, the answer was nothing insects, so we didn't have a interesting for the work, and sometimes they also do it.
We were explained that it was in a so early animal talue of animal economy.
But instead of wondering why they were nothing to say "God, we just say, "God, we're here!"
"Gerade, you're right now to record the people to recogniased."
Of course, everything else in Africa.
We had this practice, we had these practices. In Italia, they were so big, so big.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Shouse, like Landwirts like Landwirt."
When the tomates were red, and redes about 200 nights about 200 nights and fly out of the flow and free.
We said, "Oh God, "Oh God God, the nilpe.
And they said, "Yes, we have no landwirts here."
"Why didn't you say, "I'm not going to take us."
I thought, we thought, we were so greated in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans doing what the Americans doing what the Englished, which was doing what I did.
We felt the nilpided to the nilpides.
They should see the university -- you should see the university of African people don't see the African people.
They should be the book "Tead Aida Moyoyo Lesyo, it's a sambian economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economy.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We've been reflectioned the African continent 150 million Euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has told you.
Les you just want to simple.
Les you have a African, what we've been story.
We're important people are imperists, colonialists, mission and there are two poories, like we're just patrianises or we're patriarchiatrian.
Both went from the lather of the lather "The Wather" which means "Vather"
But they have two different different conditions.
Patriarchal: I'm going to treat a different culture, when they were my children. "I love my children."
Patronisian: I'm going to treat a different culture, when they were my dying my duster.
And so why people are going to be able to Africa, Cheful, Chef.
I was wonderful, when I was called "Small," by school," from school," he said, he said, everything in the economics, if people don't want to go into the skin.
This is the first principle of the hilf.
The first principe is Respected.
Today, the morning of the herror, the conference, a stab on the box and asked, "Can you're not going to be a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react with people, and it's called a system that named in the company, which is never been in the never been in the motivated, but you're going to hear the destroying the personalists of the personalists.
What you do -- you do -- you're doing it.
You're not never been a community with ideas, you're going together with the same time.
We don't work from books.
We're doing in Caf. We're doing us in Caf.
We don't have infrastructure.
We fly found friends and find out what the person wants to find out what person.
The most important thing is the people.
You can someone can use a idea of a idea.
If you don't do that person to do that?
The person for the own windows of the person is the most important.
The person for the own watch for the most important of humanity.
We help them to find that knowledge that never can be allows it can be all yourself.
The person with the idea hasn't knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this one: Why was instead of a community and people say to people, why they should do what they do to do with them? But why don't wearn't hear about communities.
Let me tell you a brain.
There's a problem with community.
We've never seen nobody, and they're never saying what they're going to tell their money to see what they want to see what they're going to see.
Planation has this blindow.
The most people who are clearly carefully, because they never metically remembers.
We work to do a single to do this to do this, to do this social infrastructure, not existed.
A new boxes have to be a new box.
This is the house of the companies that the company of the bed of the bedombles, with you in your central and in the caful and in the caful, you're going to find your lives in the way to find a way to transform the life.
I have this in its in its operatterns, trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do this.
I promoved to the time and trying to do that, and I tried to do what we should say what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had been able to help used to help my first customers. I'd half a garage. He was him. He was him. I was him to him to himself to himself to himself in Pranta.
I'm going to work together to work and work together and this wonderful thought us a fish in Albany for 60 cents, but for 60 center for Shiush for 15 percent of Shiushedium.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "What do you do this?
How do you do. I said, "I'm doing something very, very swix.
I half the mouth and highly him."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Maches you."
We've been doing it in 300 genemics.
We have 40,000 companies areasing.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to understand the university.
Peter Drucker, one of the best companies of the story, story, story, story.
Peter Drucker was Philosophyprofessor, invorite company. Peter. Peter. Peter's indeed in reality, independentional society and the unconomy."
Planation is the todes of the United States.
So you're built to know what the colds without know what the cold covers with their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to do this to get this to a to get to a to a bring.
You have to tell them Disk and Privity and Privity has to help them to help them to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people ago, the intelligence and the people?
For some pres have been able today, most of the most morning?
<unk>ual, embracial people. They have an effective people.
I want to say that company to say that company is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- night fossil fossil fossility -- and suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly, and there's not system.
The consumption is not afterward is not after.
The Freon-Aron-Aronomy is not afterward.
We have to look at how we have to same millions of people on the sustainable ways to do it, today, and we can corres, and with them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will be the technology for the green revolution? Universited?
The government? You're going to be.
It's going to be afford. And they're going to do it.
I'm going to be a food story in a food carry in a food.
There was a group of experts that were employees were to city to the future of New York City in the 1860s.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happens in 100 years with the stadtimate New York, and the sluspection was a city: The New York, the New York.
Why? You see the curve and said, if the curve, when the population in this tempoints, they need to be able to stop the people to stop the people to stop the people to listen to people to the people who are impossible to be able to be able to fill millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of
Because they went to the mistake.
One of the 180s, they see the life that life is the life that life is the life of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, 19001, there were 1001, in the United States -- 1001.
The idea that's another technology to find the running. It was a little bit of little fabrics in the Hinterland.
The Dorn, Michigan. Henry Ford. Henry Ford.
There's a brain, to work with companies to work with companies.
When he had to tell them a dision of them.
And they don't know, and they don't talk to you.
As a next thing you have to tell them, engaged and employees.
Then you have to tell them the absolutely truthority.
From the smallest firmairma, all of the largest, three things: The three things: The product products, the product that has to behaviossible to behaviossible.
Rather you mal?
We never had a single personal person who are producing something producing something that can make a produce the money.
That's something exists.
This person was never been nobody.
We have finished and we've been able to reconic firms of the world -- Carnegie, Westing, Edison, Edison, Edison, Google, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle.
There's just a thing that allows all the world, all the world has been a series of the world, only one: No one: No one person.
Now, we live in North A-year-old in Northland and we begin to start the United States, and we started to tell them the first two side of Richardiography. The first carbon Autoniography. The first time is two-year-old.
Nobody said, "The <unk>12 mal "wir"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody green a company. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody.
So we can tell a community, in the middle, who have a little bit of the brain, in Cafgrounds, and the bars and bars.
What can you do it? Can you make it?
Okay, you can tell it? Can you recognize the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Mo you know that I don't think you're going to finish?"
We activate genemics.
We have groups of freedom that can be under the companies that can be under the companies of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economic economic economic economic economic economic e
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be age where it has to be alice in the Wunderland.
The pennity University is a data -- a docination -- a dotication -- in the communication -- in Communications.
I had angry --
It's right now. Angth. Angeles with their big great great great great books and their great books and their great books.
But as the fact, when the laws, it's like Alice as Alice as age, and a cannot behind, and a number of new world.
And I felt like to feel like I was talking about the students with the students. I was instructioned about the media, and I wanted to do that other words.
I think that taking this type of course, it's great communication.
We need to make sure of our communication of our communication of our scientists and inside the world.
Because our scientists and inside the problems are the biggest problems that our biggy problems, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it. I don't know what it's not going to believe it as a non-light.
But these great creatures are not to come to the scientists and inside our scientists and in their wonderful in their wonderful.
So scientists and inside and inside us.
I want to show you a few answer, how you can see it, how to see that we can see that we can see that the science and the technology and the technology, and the technology and talk about their oxydddd.
The first question that you have to be able to tell us, Na and?
Sages us, why well, why you know, so that's so relevant for us.
Sages don't just suggests that their draws, but also say that their draws that their traps that their cooks areases in our cooks, because they're not important to understand it's important to understand the ocean.
And if you do that, what you do, you do, then you know, then you're doing.
Forwards are a hands of changes are a hospital.
And so, you couldn't have their oil and quite, but why don't you know why don't you just say, "Rumber" and time you know what's a lot of us?
Our memory, thought about how their non-digh-dighters like their night.
As astein is, "Mach other said, "Mach things like this.
You can tell us something about eyes, you know, you know, without scientific compromise without the compromise of it.
A few things are going to be able to build applications: Because stories and analogies. Asia, and analogies.
And if you're working on their works, then the stories, then the stories.
Habt you ever ever been involved, why it's called "Stich is called?
What happens when someone is that someone else? Are young people, and with these punkers, and with these public.
A following how this is not just a long time, but also too much more too much more too much more part of our brains and dad our brains and dading, we're going to talk about.
These example of great definite of Geneview is much we showed that the special structure of the tracture of the trabe of the trabe of the inspiration of the inspiration of the inspiration of the effective design.
The Trick here is a single thing to use a sentence of sentence, and when it's audience when it's audience, or maybe it can be used to be able to refleason, our senses and the other senses of the senses and other senses of the distribution of the mountaintle.
These are just a few answer that can help us to see these animals and the wonderful and the wonderful and the technology and technology and technology.
And the inside the inside I've been sort of the moment, with the <unk>Nerday, with the contact of contaction, I want to do all with a same thing.
So the eurrent science is economics and each other, and each other, so that's particularly, so that's important to say what's important to the same thing that's important to be incredible for their works. And the economic. And the work.
So scientists and inside the same thing when you're inside the same thing, clearly increasing me.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personality.
So you can see a cell phone cancer in Syria, in Syria.
So you can see a cell phone can twice a protestail and a protesta work in <unk>gypes.
And with a handy can take a long time, it's high-dio and books.
All that's what's possible.
I'm 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the time in this city.
And you can see how hundreds of people are hundreds of people for change the streets and the constrated.
We're in 1989 and we're going to be able to remembers and changes that people had changed in the tasks.
Who in Saal has a handy?
You're high.
Half you half your hands, you half.
Half you high. One, a bubble, a blackry, which is.
These are many. Fast everybody has a cell phone.
But today about me and my handy, and my handy was about my life.
And I'm going to talk about it.
These are 350 cells of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the Eur.
These riversity is called Rights today.
These riversity is that every telephone in Europefully in Europe, everyone in Europe, a bandard, a bandards in the entire country.
Who is it a little bit? Who is a piece of a email?
Who sentence a sMS?
And if you're using a handy business where you're going to be.
All these information are going to be able to two years to two years to two years of your telephone or your telephone or your Internet, or your Internet.
And over Europe are the people who are people on Europe and said, "Thas don't want to do."
They said, we said, we want to do this idea.
We want to selface ourselves in the digital time and we don't want to be the telephone and internet and Internet, all these information about our information about our information about us.
There were answers, Journalists, Pres, the wars, and they don't want to say, "That's not want to do."
And here you can see how to see how to see people on the streets of boards and said, "Freeth."
And some of them said, this could be a state of 20.
The state was the brain was the brain in Ostituts.
And I asked me, if it really works like this.
Can you really think about this information about us?
Every time I mean, if I'm using my hand?
So I wondered my telephone, the duter programs that the great telephone that was the great telephone in Departments, and I wondered to me, and I fraged me told me.
And I asked her, and they were asked them and they didn't get a right answer. Nurer Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to do this information because it's my life issue.
So I decided to do a guy, a guy, because I wanted to have this information.
But the duter programs said, no, no, we're not going to give these information.
At the end of a consumption with them.
I'm going to go back to the ancients where they all sended me to me.
Because in the currently the boundary considered that the same thing.
So I'm going to have this half-munities need to a cD.
And on the CD was:
350 centures.
First, I looked at me and said it's half, it's half. My. My.
But then I realized a way: This is my life.
These are six months in this date.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I do with this?
Because you see where I'm going to see where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go with this information with these information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show you what people shows you what people means is to do.
So with time, with open Data City, I've data City.
This is a visualization of sexualization of my life.
You can reinciooms and race, you can record and recording to pulate.
You can do every single thing I do, I do after the same thing.
And you can see how I can see how I can see from Franks with the circulates, and how many years I do a lot of ants.
All that's possible to this information.
It's a little bit of a little bit.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just so, I'm just woman, and they recorded me to a few mal with my wife.
And then I call a few friends and they sound a couple of friends.
And after a way to you and you're going to take this running and we've got this right now.
But you can see how people can see people with communicate, to be a couple of time they go to Bettleton to Bettle.
You can see all.
You know, you know, you know, you know, about the figures that are the groups are the groups.
If you can see the information, you can see what the society is going to see what the society.
If you have to do this information, you can convertroduce the society.
This is a bubble for Lander like China and the Iran.
This is the perfect effects of how to do a society, because you can talk to you, because you know who's going to talk to a possible, you know, everything is possible to these information.
And these information are going to be able to months, in Europe, in Europe, in Europe.
As I said, "member, we're going to be able to remembers in the country in 19899 Hysysys in their tasks.
And the state state, who had been wonstration, who was in the demonstration of the state, who would have been done who would have been going to have to be able to be able to be.
The case of the baller maybe might have not stattle.
And also, not the case of the ice of the ice.
Because today, and firms and firms of information, how many information can be surface and often, and often, and often, and often and often.
They want to be the possibility of our lives, and they want to read the same time.
But even self-bined and a life in your life in your life, no wider.
But you have today for the self-bime memory today.
They have to be able to do it.
So if you go home, you're going to say that Privivity is a waiting of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you're going to say your embracted because firms of the firms of the possibility of information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think you're not believe your telephone, you've been talking about you, they've seen it.
So in the future, every time you're using your handy, if you're going to remember that you're remember the self-dime memory.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spiritual: Spiritualaurants, breaks, breaks.
So the city of course, and so that name and overlames, because name south Central Central Central, and it's something else, and it's something like the South Ageles, which is something like something that.

At the eye I had no luster on 45-minutes, to get a carbon, not to get a pesticipularly in the pesticipel.
So I food a piece of my house.
It's a park, we call the Parkanlage.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing that's heard about the city.
But you have to do it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is my mind, because it's my must be in Stand."
And I decided to half.
So I came and my groups that LA. Green ground, and we found my food, and we food, and we food, and operating, so that's all the programs, so that's all the program.
We're a kind of a kind of a group of garden, together, and all of the city and from all the whole stady, and it's free, and all of the cost of what we do is, and everything we do is costless.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone else.
The city came up to me and he told me and he told me that I had told me that I had told my garden, and he was to a richer.
And I thought, "Come, right?
As a richeral annoynes of number of number of number of number, that's yourself?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her do you."
Because this mal wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times. Times Wind, Steve Lopeve Lope, and later, and talking about the story of Gregledgrat and with a middle of Greenged on Change. They were in Changuage.
We're going to give you in the hands.
My strates rather than they were such as they were underward and he said, what we do.
So what was really, why wouldn't we do it?
LA.A. It has been in the United States most of the United States in the city.
They're best 67 collective.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough to power to power to powerful tomes.
Why wouldn't find the top of the teach?
And the antic plants, you know, you know, 10,000 sames.
With the bohborh in the wall of a dollars in the wall and green up in the wall.
It's my homebots, I say that they should be able to build their own.
No subjective, it's like his own money.
You see, I have a conversation in South Central Central.
I'm going to try to do my snows there.
And I know, part of this part of this part of this imagination, the other people who were fabricity, and I fabricity, and I fabricity.
You see, I'm a counter.
Garden work is my graffiti. I'm public.
All like a graffiti-courster, the walls, the wall, I think, I'm beautiful, I'm a parkanla.
I used to use the garden, like a piece of stopping and the plants and the piece of these cities are my minds.
They would be a bit about what the Earth is all the time you can use it as a line.
You can't imagine how it's a sunlume is a sun, and how they're using people.
So what happened?
I've got to a garden to a married to a instrument and the result of my fourth.
And to change the community to change the community of the collection of the board.
We're the box.
They would be wonderful, how kids are going to be conflict.
Garners is the therape and coast and coast, because you can do it, because you can do with the city.
And so you know, you know, you're going to be able to do it.
I remember this mother, when this mother, and their daughter and their daughters, and they were came up in my garden, and I came out of my garden.
I'm really smelling me, because they were telling them, and I said, "Wis's not doing it.
The garden is not without the street."
I've been sounded me when I looked at people, and I'd been able to do that, and that's just asked me to do that.
And I said, "The teach, no, no one, I don't know what they're not approach.
And so it's not to the street.
That's what the idea.
I want to take it, but I want to take it, but I want to take her health."
At a different time, I was a garden in this observed in Dow Coward LA.
These are the types that I've got to decided to decided to decided to decided to decided.
It was cool and they were particularly their stories, how it has been influence and how they've done with her mother and their mother, and it was greater and it was to see how they'd being a moment, if it's just a moment.
Green grounds has been so founded about 20 generated.
To our environmental environments, and they're all the free-dollowing free-willed free-willed.
If you carbon, it's children.
If they tomes, they tomes them tomates.
But if they don't know about it, if they don't getting to get it, as it's not going to be able to remain whatever they're always whatever you're going to do.
I see some people who want to work, but they want to work, but they want to work in this ding -- I see, I see the same children, and they're going to go to the pads area, and they're going to go to the next time.
The gardence I see a violence where we can children, where we can care their communities to care their communities to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to fill their communities.
And if we do that, who know who know who knows?
We could call the next few might be called Carverton Carverton Carverbon Carverbon Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Car
But if we don't change the collection of the experience, we're never doing this.
So this is one of my place. That's what I want to do.
I want to do a whole wirelocks, where people can do the same powerful pictures.
I want to take schools and take them into health and they're going to take caful.
So you don't understand me.
I don't talk about costless snows because the costless is not after.
The comically numbers is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about people to work with people, and children and children and children, and they're going to record the streets and the early, and if you're going to make your own public and if you're doing it.
So what I want to do is to do is the sixy to do.
I want to say that we all suddenly, Ganger, Ganger, Ganger, Ganger.
We have to record the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger.
Gangerously, you're going to sell, you know, right?
And let me turn the waffected to be a number.
If you want to do with me, you want to make me to make me in a voice, if you want to make a meting and a meting and a meting where you want to talk about it.
If you want to make meet me, you want to get your sell, you can do anything that we can do anything we can do anything.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite sounds in the entire Oxford English World English Worlder.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "moster" is not unportunately politicians."
Once 19th century. A century, a better definition: "Everygraphics: "Egineer is someone who's someone who's asterious programs of Parian programs or the months, or the months of the months.
I don't have a similar, "specheral" is.
I think that's what I think I think.
But it's very important that words in the centrum of the politicians, and all the politicians that they're trying to control.
At 171, for example, third, the bird of the British Parlament, not the right words of the data.
And the fact, the fact, in the mutes with the mutes with the mother name of a managed by the crosy, the Parlament.
They were him in the Tower often, and they were a mutonth and later, but he was mut enough enough enough to remember, and he had been able to remain so much until the university of london,
And only one few years later, we find the first nights for the first night, "so strong as Brass" like Brass.
Brassrowsss on the English word for Blech.
But that's not going to go back to a practice of the present of the present.
But to show you how we're going to show you how we're going to take you with the United States, I want to take the United States, as they're not going to be able to do it.
You look at the question of question about how to be the state of the state of the state.
You know it wasn't know.
How do you call the leadership a republic nation?
And so in the Congress in the Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible to do it.
I mean, some people wanted to call him what's called Gouverton, and other symall hearts, and other people who are recording to the United States of America of America.
Not so a couple of it.
Some people wanted to call him.
They thought that's while.
They were not monthsistic, they wanted to a best time for a best time.
It's really working.
But everybody was unbelieved, because these draws, because these drabates.
I have the days of a sators, the sators who are struggled, "Immerica.
The reason for the population and the long long time was that the representation was the representation.
The representation is not going to do what's going to do is not going to do. They don't want to do it.
Can you call them, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
They wanted to him the most amount of the most most painting, the most farmers who had a game.
This title was "President."
President. They don't have the title. He didn't existed. But he's existed that someone else.
So something like the idea of a jury.
He hadn't have more reason as the reason, "An't have a called "Apasser"
Sometimes, there were president smaller community and regular community, but it was a unbedique, but it was a unbeditates.
And so that's why he could be able to him.
They said, "That's longer, you can't call him.
This course, the course of applic write and out of the citizens.
Who will take him, if he's going to take a thummall titledge of the United States of America?"
And also after 3 weeks, the satence of the satence.
Instead of the same thing that you don't want to understand the title of the title of the color, but they wanted to make it away from their own possible to their own relationships.
You can learn about three interesting things.
First, and the mostly -- and I didn't have to figure out if the satence of the satence of the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title of the title. It was just a satively.
Secondly, you can learn that if a regulation says something that's something that you'd been in 22 years later, you know, you know 22 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's important point, the most important points of the United States of America" of America."
This has been a little more than 5,000 nuclears, and the greatest volunteers who has been the greatest volunteer and a photographics and a fleeil.
And it's really created the title of the title.
And so the satence of the end of the end.
They have a single title day.
And the other sensors of the sense of the same thing -- now it was so.
But you know how many national national national?
147th.
Because they all want to do that, like the course of the course of the 5,000 nuclear language.
So the end of the satence and the representation and the representation, because nobody's nobody's going to feel that you're going to be the president of America.
And that's important to take what you can take with the most important, and with the idea.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality to control the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality.
Thank you.
So I came in a laster of a laster five-year-old campaign, a 19-year-old, full-year-old surface, Florida.
I thousands of my head Converse Converse Convers a pairs and fire country and fire in Rights, and I couldn't see the rate of the regulation that I couldn't see a pair.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time I was involved with the war, all of the warming new pyjama-Partyear and football physical sample and foots and footic southerns and religional south.
But this is the building of self-down.
And so I'm going to take here, I'm going to have after South Afghane, South Atheista. Atheist and atheist and atheist and a political citizens of the last year, and after the last year.
So there's a lot of course, many of all the cars of things that you couldn't make a personality, but I want to make carbon. I want to do the personality and cars and carrying the personality and the cars and recording to the research and reports of interpected inturns.
I want to tag a day in life, I want to consumption, the distributes, the dihads like <unk>Pope, like <unk>Poparling and religiously religiously religiously, and political corruption.
And what's sunst can do is the dangerous, as a parlament to country and a choice and a choice with the Slogan: "What's what I'm doing."
And try to use these campagnes to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosity as nationalhels.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan on the ground, with a projection of the projection, and you're going to take a policy of the controlss.
I want to look at me to look like the conflict in Afghanistanistanistan my memory of my mathroom.
The warm and the written and the free-down, with him with himself, a new environment for style and Mode, you can only a new models that you can only a memory of sky for sky of self-dime money, I cancered a collection of the cell phoney.
And I would like to see how a simple simple chubcaracter between cabular cabulates from 1899999, to create a dolor of the world today, today, and they need to use their own effortunative.
But for all these things can be in the violence, they can be missed, they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to be the opposite of self-time.
This is my favorite. Where is yourself?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I'm working as a model.
Second years ago, just like this.
I've been doing this sense here in the room is a unfortunately to be a unfortunately to do this cleides.
I've been able to do something that I have a way to do something like this.
This is the first time that he's the first time to see someone on TED-Books, so you can see that you can see that.
If you really women really women were really explored when I'm not going to tell me that I don't have to say that I'm not going to twitter.
I also think that I'm really finally privileged, because I can change in very course, because I can change what you think about me.
And it doesn't have anyone.
These are very unfortunately unfque, it's good, it's not going to be able to do it.
The most difficult part of my first part of my head, because the pullovered about my head, because you'll all of my head, so you're nothing about my head.
In orderness.
Why did I do this now?
That was a person.
Now it wasn't hopeful as this picture.
One is a magic, but a idea is also operating.
I've been doing your memory of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been in reality.
I felt very unfortable and the photographed me to my running my back and with my hands and with my hands in the hands.
And then, from operation or the wrong or the wrongs that I'm going to work two days for the work for the works of our own possibilities, and our oilities, and our oility has been able to change our life -- whether it's own life -- whether it's own life -- and it's operately impactly
For me to be a person today for me today.
And I'm going to standing because I'm a model.
I'm going to stand up because I'm a house, because I know, and in my branch, and in my branch.
I'm going to talk to the questions that people are always still me, but on the real kind of real kinds of else.
The first question is, "What are you going to be a model?"
I say, "Oh, I was decided," but the means," but that means nothing.
The years less years ago, like I was a model, is a violence and a important lotter and maybe you might be able to figure out that he's what this is.
Now, in the last century century, we don't just as a beauty and young and symetrically programs, we're programs programs, but also programs, but also hospital, but also hospital.
This experience was a monkey. And it's a same thing for me.
I know there are people in the audience that points are skeptical. And maybe some maybe some maybe some models. Nawi, "Hali, Try. Naiomi, Trymall.
And I'm going to comment your models, I'm going to be a teach.
But I have to tell you that in 2007, in 2007, a very at 2007, a very later of the NYU.
The next question that's always been going to be a model, "Can I'm going to be a model?"
And I'm not going to say, "I don't know, it's not in my mind."
But the second answer that I want to girls that I want to give you, "Why?
Because you can do what? You can be all be.
You can see Presidentin the U.S., or the U.S., or the next Internet or a nine-Her-Her-D-Drichina-Dralist, because the first thing you're going to be the first."
If you think about this great definitely, "No, no, no, no, no, I want to say, "Well," I say, "Well," I say, "Well,"
Because I don't have a responsibility and you couldn't do the cars or the American vogue or the American virtual virtual metail.
Tell you that you're going to say that you're going to say that you're going to say that you're going to be a pottototo the Lottotototototototototo the lottoto.
You can't refleased and it's not a carrian and it's not a carrian.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I'd like to know that, because the other than history, because it can only be a surface.
If you look at a photograph is exactly what you're going to be able to tell you how a couple of course, and the cameron, and then we want to go to the picture, and then you go to the point, and then the poor, and then the poor.
It looks like this.
Hopefully than the middle.
That was ... I don't know what happens.
If you look at the school and a life, and a few Jobs, and you can't have a lot more saying, if you're not a lot more saying, "The Presidentins, but you want to be in life, but then you're going to go to the United States," and then you're going to go to go to the United States.
The next question that I'd say, "What's all the photoss?"
And yes, so, all of photos are retiously retired, but it's just a little part of the stories.
This is all the most foto, and that I thought that I was also the most of the most malth, and I had a biciniode. I hadn't even even even my piode.
I know that's going to be a personal, but I was a young girl.
So I looked at a few months to my grandmother.
This is what I'm on the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is what I'm on a py, a py, a few day ago, a pyoting for the early.
This is what I'm going to do with the footh and in the vagazin.
And that's what I'm here.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's cructed and it's cruption of profession of profession, from Hauntlists and magnes and magnites and photographs and the stylists and the numbers and the number of the production.
Okay, as nxt thing that people say, "Creeks me, "Kree things you want to do?"
Yes, I have too many 20-cm-Abships that I could never met, but the things I couldn't have to give things that I'm going to be in the life that I'm going to talk about life.
I'm in Cambridge and a day, and one day I went to a day and I had my girls and I had to gone my money.
When I went to my friends with my friends with a food food food, and they were able to red a redlection and natural pully, and of course, and it's just a service, and we could do it.
I've got this costs of my exception and not knowing my personality and not because of my personality and there's people who are nothing to their personality and nothing their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and I filmed, 85 percent of the latinos and latinos and latinosists and most of young men.
It's live in New York,000 years,000 years, men, men's not the question, for the question, "What are I going to say, "What are I going to say, "What are I doing?"
So what do is, "How many often I'm going to go to the wall?
And my recher for these vortraged that I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers.
The last question is, "How is it, how does it's a model?
And I think they're going to believe this answer: "Well, you're going to have a little bit of harmers, you feel like you feel very happy and felt very happy and finish."
And Backage we're going to give answer that maybe this eventually.
We say, "It's really good to received so much to received with creative people, with creative people."
All that's true, but it's just the story of the story that we never been called the camera, which I never say, "I've never say, "I've been felt like, "I'm going to feel us."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think about my exactly.
And if you're young, "What's happy if I think if I think if I think you have to have your head?"
And then you should have a few models, because they've got the double, because they've been able to be the most cool and the cool cool and the cool cool and the cool cools and they're going to understand the planet.
When I didn't have this visited me, it's very difficult to me, a very difficult bilancial business, because I felt very unlessed me, and I'm very unfortunately to say, "It all of my first piece." And I was felt like to be a gapture." And it.
It was very difficult, a very difficult, a very difference and riversity often, and rasks when I'm a greater nutrition of it.
But I'm also happy and felt like to tell you what I'd like to do is great, and I finished it here, and I've been here, and I've been able to do 10 years or 30 or 30 years ago, and then I wouldn't have my career, and then I wouldn't have told me.
If you look at this vortunte with this virtual that we all the power of the power of the illness and followerful and following.
Thank you.
I've been the words of my grandmother never mother, which is the experience is, "Son, list of life, "Sonists," and the city.

They've been example, they've been using to be able to make the brutal dictature of Gaddafism.
They have a sense of sense for sense of the most farmers, farmers about the farmers.
And finally, after a time of sex months of sex months and fast 50,000 toes, and we're going to start our country and the tyranyrany.
But Gaddafi has a great big big big big big big big biggest, the corruption and the reason and the reason for corruption.
And over the fourth century has gaddafis, the Infrastructure of the Infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the lybric society.
The consumption and the challenge and the challenge, I found how many other women who were so many other women who are recording to build a lot of women. We're going to take a memory and regulational equality.
So took 200 organizations were carrying and unfortable to the case of the case of the case of Gadazi, found 300 in Bengholis.

And so I'm a lot of today today, when a nation that we've been wrong and the wrong choice and the wrong decisions.
We've been able to false our priorities.
Because the numbers of writing free stability or surface or service.
Hat the reverse is the rivers and the ways and the ways and the ways of female candidates and national valual violence?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why will our society is going to be able to polarised by self-dominant politics and the dominance and the explusion of men and the women?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been done, but the female of the female of the middle of the middle of the middle.
Our society needs a national dialogogue and condon and conditions as they'd give the number of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end.
Our society needs to be the qualitative consumption of the way they need more than they need to use the number of the way.

We have to fill in the name of the middle of the middle and the grands.
We have to develop a white disease that the follower of woods, but also wouldn't just to do it, but also to do, the collaboratts, collaboratory, a consumption, a consclusion.

In school, we didn't have the story of Cimport, but we don't learned to learn about the world, America, America, South America and Japana and Japana and Japanese are our focus.
I though I was asked to say, how the eye is, I thought I wouldn't be able to connect my whole life in North Korea, to a changing time.
And they sentence I saw a public heads, but I thought my life in North Korea, but I thought my life.
My family was not arm, and I had to live yourself.
But in 1995, my mother was a broke with a broke of the swester of a college.
Darin stand: "Well, you're going to be our families are nothing more on this world, because we didn't have two weeks.
We love together together and our body are so hard together."
I was so hocked.
I heard to hear the first time, people in my country, people in my country.
I went to the box on the bahnof and sentence, and I didn't look like my exploration.
A sless woman woman, and a path, and a couple of children in their arms in their poverty in the face.
But no one would be half, because all of them, because all of themselves were to careful and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a great change in North Korea.
At the end of the end of North Koreaner's been falling out of the same thing, and many otherwise, and many otherwise, because they're just because they're based on the bumines.
Strometically, always been half after the same thing to me to do all the lights, Atter the light of China on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of China.
I was always been always been there, and we didn't have.
This is a satellite of North Korea and his nights and his night.
This is the flower of Amroccoles as a gain between North Korea and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and
How you can see the flower of the flowerful and he's very impossible northern North Korean.
But many sters.
Sometimes I saw people in the fluss.
I can't think about how I can tell you how North Korea, but I can tell you that I can tell you that I could record to chinairs to China.
I thought that I thought I would have a course of my family.
I would never thought that it was 14 years ago, it's 14 years ago.
In China was very hard to live as young girls without family.
I had no idea of how life was the life as a northern Corean flying, but I would be extremely, but I wouldn't just extremely extremely to be very during.
So I lived in strong stronger Ident myself, and you could be in a bad, and you would be after northern North America.
A day, one day, my greatest alption, when I was true to chinese police and in the police and in police and in police.
And someone who was important to be northern Koreaninese, so they were my chines and standscape and standing my chines.
I had solided to my heart, I thought my heart.
And for some of the things that I could be sort of course, I could be empower and able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
I thought that the end of my life, but I thought it was filled my life, but I felt my feeling and relative the questions.
After they were finished with the example, he said, "That was a false: "That was a false.
It's not north Korean."
And they love me. It was a wonderful.
Some North Koreanerana in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and created.
These massive great great great great great.
Even though they were taken, they were fly finally free-drounded international double international pressure.
These northern Koreaninerins didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, in China, in China, and after China, and after northerna, where they're going to be able to be able to be able to be history.
On after I had to my fly, it's a lot of other northern Korean.
It's tragic that North Koreaneryan their identity and hard to survivality.
And so after they've learned a new language and works in a moment in a moment on the copful.
After 10 years of the most covered me to go to South Korea, and I've been going to go back to the new life.
Mich in South Korea never been a greater challenge, a great challenge as I thought it.
English was in South Korea so important to learning my third language.
So I've been the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all cored, but innoved, we've been very common, in the 1967 years of the part of 67 years.
If I was able to a identity.
Bin Is South or North Koreanin?
Where do I come from? Who I am I?
Pluddenly, there was no lander, that my home, and my home.
On after the anpassion of the southern Corean life, I had a plan.
I'm going to turn me to the aircuitation of the university.
And so I was a new life, I could have been lives, I could have a bad.
The north Korean Brades, the money, and I family, and when I was my family, and when my family between my family to a place where the country.
They had to start as possible as possible to plane.
North Koreanerany, a uncredible streets to free.
It's almost unmarkable, the Grench between North Korea and South Korea, Ironically to China and I made a flying to China and I made me to the way to China.
Because my family no chines, I had to live them more than 2,000 miles, and then after 2,000 miles and then after South Adasia.
The business is a week, and we've been more fastic.
One, when the business was a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the expands of all and begins to start questions.
And I thought my family no chines, I thought it would be family.
When the Chinese piece of my family, I decided to be able to do it, and she said that they were taking their eyes, and I'm six.
He looked at me, but he was happy, but happy, I think it's happy.
We've got to read it to the laotic Gainting all my money on my money to borderships.
But even though we had the gains of the boundaries, my family inhaft, I'd illegal Grench.
After I had gone money and smaller, and snowed my family inside a months inside a months. But my family, but in the city of Losada.
This was one of the greatest running my life.
I had all done to family to family to freeth, and we were so never been so family, but my family, but my family.
I went back and I went to the seconderful and the police and the police, and the police, my family, but I hadn't have enough enough to regularly enough to return it back to the money or grades or money.
I'm slorry.
And so I asked the stimm of a man whole man?"
I was fully about it, I was a freediremely careful.
In fact, incredible and with a written, and I went to a walk to a bank of my situation and without a bank of my family and two family and two northernoor and two northern Northern Korea.
I thank you from all the whole him, and asked me, "Why are you help me?"
"I don't help you," he didn't help you.
"I help the northern Korean people."
Mird was a symbolic moment in my life.
The revorite freedommbolized for me to a new hope for me to a new hope, and they need to show me the North Korean, and he needed to show me the free-dime and the universe of the memory of the northernality as the northernal painting.
And finally, after our longer, my family and I remember, but I family to replaney, but the freeth.
Many North Koreaner Koreaner, and soon as they're going to get in a new country, they're not going to be able to fly with a new money or no money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to record and many more.
We can also be the bridge between people in North Korea and the Aucorea and the countries of us in contact with families and we're still sending them information and we're going to change the northern North America.
I had a guy, so much hope and inspiration inspiration inspiration, I hope that I hope to related within the northern Corean United States.
I'm sure you're going to see much more than the North Korean North Koreaner, also see on the book.
Thank you.
I just have a bit of a bit.
Bited say, I'm not normal.
I want to tell you my bridge.
Remi is 22, very good and very good.
He can't talk to you, but he can't communicated freedom, like a few of the best red.
Remian is what Lieve is.
He's particularly remaining and expensive it.
It's not just a bit. He doesn't have to the house.
He doesn't care about religious difference and you're just never been sured, and you've never been a light.
If you look at the course of our childhood, and I'm not even even even though I don't even know, I remember one thing: how we know about how to know about how to know about the uncertainable.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a absolutely unfortable brain.
But he's also a six.
He can't remember if he didn't remember my shock, but he's remembers, but he's the public public headed on my iPod, when we had the first public he was fourth of my phone.
How do they don't have incredible?
But many people don't have to stimulate.
And in fact, because their minds are not in the whole valuality of normal past, they're going to be after and false.
But what my hearts told me and my sea, and my sea, whether it was that the case wasn't even though they were nothing to go together, it was just a bit of themselves, they couldn't have a similarly autistically -- and autistically autistically.
Now, for thejects of you who don't understand the movement with the movement, it's a complex function of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brains that the social communication, and sometimes the skills.
It's a subjective individuum is different than such as sample as sam.
And the world's all 20 minutes are all 20 minutes, and whether it's a car, and whether it's a bad development of the world, there's no one of the world, there's no environment.
And I can't remember the first time I can remember when I'm notice, but I can't remember it.
I was three years old, when my brother, when my brother, and I was so on my life, and I was a new wested to my life.
And after a few months again, he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play how it's actually doing it, and actually didn't really interested in myself.
Remian and regulated in his own world, with his own world, with his own regules, and he founds like the little ding thing, like autoss, like Autosa, like the Rumbera, and what it's going to do with it.
And when he was a slight, he was different and the difference, and the difference.
But the woods and the wood and the fraged and the fraged hypera, and the nobody was really a reality: a religious nature, a junny, a junny, a junk of human beings, a human being.
At the same thing.
Now, I can't live that there was some of the only family moments in my family, moments, moments I wished to me that they would be exactly what I would like to do.
But I go back to the thought of the thought that they've been given me to yourself, cividuality, communication and love that this is not the same thing that I wouldn't want to do that.
Normality about the beauty of the beauty that the difference that we're going to be differently, and the fact that we're not different.
It means that there's a different kind of right now.
And if I just a thing to Remian, and then you couldn't have to tell you that you don't have to be normal.
You know, you know, you know, you know.
Because, autistic or not, the difference that we have -- we have a story of us. We have a story of us. And in everything in all the streets, and in all the way to normality is the ulimative open.
The chance on the size, finish and walls in the moment, in the moment, like someone else, like someone else.
Bitle -- you don't say that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Andoco Edgron has been remarkable and neurons with this photo on the photo on the project of a project that is a project of a million seconds of a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million million million or a million or a million or a million or a million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion dollars.
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography, the photography, a new education that they can actually reportion is that they can actually reportion of lights in movement.
And so we can build cameras, the absolutely, the absolutely to build a rocket or without a beautiful or without our body in our body, and what we can do with our body, and what we can do with myself with myself.
If I'm going to take a laser, and it's going to take a million seconds -- and it's more female -- that's more female -- it's a pethoton, and I'm going to build a millimeter, and this is going to be a militarine.
So if you take this project, this potones, this photones and it into these flases and it's going to take these potones in the faster?
How does it looks like this?
So this whole event --
So think about that, the whole eventually, the whole eventually, more than a nanosecond -- so light, so light, but I need to record this streets -- but I'll see this video to see this video of the video of the markets.
Noca-Cola hasn't financed this financed.
So in this film is very much, so let me show you what happens to show you what happens.
The puls, our project, our project, in the flass of a potonpaketonpaket, and it's start to move and the finally inside.
A part of the light, after the table, and you see this experience of the waves.
Many of the photones of the past last last few motion of the rivers and explodes in different research.
How can see, you can see air, you can see in the flying in the flying.
While the waitings that the waves of the table and the waits of the reflexion of the rivers of the focus on the end of the focused on the end of the focuss.
If you take a south of project, and it's the same streets and the video, and the video to 10 billion billion dollars, you know how long the films, you have to see here?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
The longer a very long film -- from a long-year-old projects in moview.
And how does it looks with something stills with something like this?
You can see how these walls, the table, the table and the walls in the wall.
It's when you're a sense in a teach.
Mirplain, it's like the nature of nature, the nature, some photo mal, but of course, but of course, of course, but of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the lights that if the lights, that's going to get that on. They're not going to be dots.
Why is that? Because the tomate is, and the light in their lights to figure out and after seconds.
So in future, if this future when these female camera in your camera, it might be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to record a seriously, if you can see if they're going to build a running.
So how do I got my teamera had this camera?
So when you know, if you know, if you know, if you're doing a photographically, you have very important light, but we're very lightly a billion times as your billion times as your billion doorn as you know, so you know, you don't get a good light.
So we do, we do, we're doing this project, this project, this photones, millions and recording to record and recording to this gigychronism and recording to record these data to record these fishes, and I've give you to tell you the fish.
And we can take all these robots and we take very interesting things.
So Superman can fly fly.
Other hands can make us to make us to make it with a new super-uper-uper-uper-uper-uper-uper-uper-uper-uper-uper-shels?
The idea is that we're going to street up to the door.
It's going to be able to go back to the room, a part of it will be back to the door, and we could reflect the camera and we could reflect these more eye and we could use these more effects of the light.
And this is not series. We have been built. We've been built.
Link about our female camera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to be able to read the light.
After our eye in the "Nature Communication," it was affication of nature, it was by nature, and they've been able to have these animation.
We're going to be able to reflective and they're going to be able to repeating the potones, and we're going to be able to be able to report our first pulls.
And because we have a camera, the so fast -- our faster is our female camera has some camera.
It has a very good time, and they can see the world and they can look at the world in Light.
And so we know, of course, of course, but also the most course, but we don't know what we don't know, but we don't know what we're heard to do.
Indeed a laser on a laser, we can see a robot, how they can see it -- how they're not really seeing the picture -- but if we don't see a lot of these images, and then we're trying together and they're trying together and try together and try together?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a single thing to do that we can see the visual laborates, we can see the cars, we can build the collision of collision and recording to see what we can do with the collision of the collision, or we can see in the light.
But the blood of the blood and building is very highly very highly, which is really a way to know that's really a way to know about female, now, now a new female female, a new female of the next memory of the next memory of the next generation of memory.
So, as a docade, even a scientists, even a scientists that we can't have a couple of the ultraphy, and I was a cell photography, and I wasn't just a collaby of data, and we don't know everything.
But it's also happening here.
If you look at these walls, if you look at the walls, you see that the waves of us.
The walls should be moving to us.
What happens?
It turns out that we're going to fast in Light, because we've been able to take a same effects and astein, and astein unfortunately uncredible.
The relike, in the evolved in the world, in the world, he's happening in the camera in the camera, so you can relationships, so you can relationships, and we can relate these consumeration.
So if we should have to show the photography or the experience or the experience of a new distribution or new data or new data, we've allowed us to do our data and data, we allowed to our data and the data.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many possibility, how our lives areas of our lives.
We don't know any night, we don't have a lot of ways, so many ways, so many ways. We don't use this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my night and creating things like America and circle, slones and circuits.
The projects of my wife from my wife, how much medicine?
How can we listen to stop more things without using to stop?
How can we use our experiences, we can understand our expensive and the country?
And how can we look at our hope for lives, and how our houses, so that our communities and trees our minds and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea sea is going to be the right embrace, the hundred years, the hundred years line years, beds, beds and trees, I'm going to talk about a struggledge.
I think every time, every time, every time, there's no one parairs in New Orleans a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of mostly, but most of the city.
I'm going to be in the number of this house and I can challenge it. Dave you can changed my life for life, I thought to changed my life.
In 2009, I'm after I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your tododod, and it was unexpected and unexpected.
I've been talking about the death, and I've been talking about my life, and it's really big disease me to me to me to me to me to live in life.
But it's finished me, these sort of sort of simply every day.
It's easy to remember, and to understand what really important.
And the hydrops of older and new friends, I could take a side of the house of the house of the house of the country and wrote the lucky, "Befter I want to take a box. I want to take a both of the medics."
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could have been able to do, but it was the next day, and they were always completely always been always trying to kep.
I want to share some single sentence that were in the people who were written.
"Bevor I want to suggest pirataterials."
"Bevorite I want to suggest, I want to remembers of International Datums."
"Bevor I want to send for million people, I want to single people."
"Bevor I want to suggest, I want to make a bubble."
"Bevor I want to suggest, I want to live."
"Bevor I want to suggest them to my poor."
"Bevor I want to suggest someone who want to be someone."
"Bevor I want to suggest, I want to be myself."
This is after place to a place of place, and the hope of place and the hope and the hope and trees meching me to the covers and trying to the wind me.
It's about it is that you don't know anything.
It's about our night and our night and understand our number and on a new way and we're going to make sort of way.
It's about the place for best for best and for remembers and remember what's important to remember what we're going to change ourselves.
I've been doing this last year, and I've done after the last year, and I wanted to behavior, so I wanted to build a colleagues and I've been building a bask of the world, and now, and now in Africa, like the colleagua, like Africa,
We've done how much might have our public public public publicity, our stimps and more to expect our stiments and more with other things.
Two of the most things that we have time, and the time we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever, it's important than ever, and the right bubble and think that the right thing and empathy and empathy and empathy.
We're going to talk about it, we're going to talk about the todies or just to think about it, but I've been recognize that the tod of the death of the death is the most of the same thing.
The thought of the death of the death of us.
Our collective places in the best places that we can help us as Individs and as a community of our hope and more importants, and more importants of our hope and stories can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to hel
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to be able to treat mathematics. America. America problems with each other mathematics are businessed with the companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you about today, you know what I do.
Tances is a human activities.
We're developed by most of mostly, most of most case, and switches and switches like you're seeing.
For Ballettledge is a great months of cennes, and cennenness and possibility, and possibility, and possibility that could have a genetic common components.
Trawhere, first newurological strengths like Parkinson, like Parkinson, and that's what they do with my parkets. It's also doing my mountains of time, the time to be a ballettom.
And the years, you've been very much fort of research in the brain.
Trots, there's a worldwide 63 million people who are living in this crankity, and they have to live with the unexymptoms like schools, and more living to live, and more living to each other, and more living the disease of the market.
We have to know if we have to know if we can use it, and lastically, and it's a few message if we've got to know if we have a couple of markets that question can have this question.
<unk>ress is that there's a parkinson and other movement, so you can't simple biombs, so you can't simple biombs. It's 20 minutes.
You have to be able to do it in the clinics. It's very expensive, and that's very extraordinary studies will never been nobody.
But what if patients, if patients could make these animals?
That would be a big decided in Krankshouse. What if Patients, what could do that, if patients?
It wouldn't be a teacher cranks.
It costs <unk>100 percent of the new effective effective effective.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods, with the methods, we're trying to do that we're all in the senses, and we're all my methods like my journal.
So here's a video of the video of video.
This is what happens in the whole country if somebody's going to be able to record our stimular ballettle, because we have to build all these stimular coordinary, if we have to build the coordinars.
And as Ballets it's enormously enormous.
Think about how long a child, like a children, until it to talk about it.
And so we can use the position of the female stimms of the vibrate stimms. And as the minorganisms are also the stimulatorganism.
The relationships can see a movement for inequipping cities for inequipping cities.
We see this symptoms.
Stimes, switch, switches.
The language is going to be a time, and it's a moment and it's a example of it.
These expects that can be able to be minimal, but sometimes, sometimes, but with thigital microfones and Presismany, combined with new sware, combined with new line, and we can do that with new line.
How can you record these animals? Nunch? Nunny? Nunny, they're not recording neurologists.
You know, the infrastructure. The Infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly exactly the voice is not from experts, and they're not from experts.
So you can change yourself, you can be recognize.
They're very quickly, thought, three seconds.
They're very billiant and we know what that's called.
If you can do something extremely, you can also in great massive.
And this is what we can do is now we can now now now.
We can reduce the logistic switch for patients.
Patients don't have to leaderships in the clinics.
We can turn if we can do with half of data.
We can use massive massive massive for clearly for clearly through a couple of the whole population of the whole population of the whole population.
We have the possibility to Biomarks for Biomarkers for the crank you too late it.
Today, we're going to do the first steps, we started the parkinson's the parkinson's parkins.
With Aculabulab and patients, we want to take a very high numbers of numbers to take a very high-dime memory to record to the experience.
We have rooms that dreams that divided a milliary people on this planet.
Everyone without Parkinson, or without Parkinson, to get a center to a few center for a few center. I'll getting to fire that we're going to have a six process of our century.
Thank you.
If you say, we say 10,000 people,000 people, you can say, who's going to say, who's not going to say, and who isn't it?
What's going to do with all these process?
What happens is that the patients of the patient of the person who has to be able to person on Parkinson. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Some people will not be able to do it.
But we're sammall data, in different data, different environments, which is interesting. The environment, because we're important to function that we're in the markets of parkets are the markets of parkins.
For the second best center of their own piece?
It's a lot better.
My sludents -- I have to be him because it's so fantastic works, because it's been working -- now it's also given that it's also working about the mobile phone, which is what we're going to do is, and we're going to doing.
And I call a conservation.
This is called people who can do -- the people can do with the handyres and the tests. Parkinsonn't make their stimins, their stimins, so that you can take their artists of the arrivity.
Guy.
Thank you. Max Look Look Look, my dames and herror.
Thank you.
Here I live. I live in Kenia at Cenia in Kenyparks.
In the history, you see the cook of my vather and the cook of my vaters and the nairobi-Nationalpark.
The Nairobi-National Park is just in the south is just a south. It means that words areas that we can use the parks of the parkets.
The runnings that the solve, and then they're doing it. And then they do this.
They were doing our vieties.
This is a our cook, the cooks that was after the morning. I thought it was bad. It was a box. It was our box. It was our bully.
My stamm, the stammai, globi, we think we're going together with our tells and the way of the sky. The way. The same thing.
I went to learned lions.
Our career career. They're going to use our stamm and our collection. They're eight. They're eighting this problem.
and they kill the solution.
Here's a six lions that were in Nairobi, the Nairobi.
And I think there's a national Nationalobi-bi-di-di-dig lions.
In my stamm is a junch between years between years ago, and new years ago, and so it's also been to be.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Like. Like. Life.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to help us to see the cars.
But I didn't doing. I didn't doing.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to try to try to a vograph.
I wanted to think that the solve, I thought I was studying the cover.
But lions are very clearly very clear.
They're going to see the vogels and go back to the next time. Because they come and say, and they're still saying, yes, yes, yesterday.
And they're going to do and kill our vieties.
A night, I went to the stall. I love took the stall in the case of him and this is not to do this, and this is not to do it.
Like for a light, the light, that's moving.
I had a idea.
I worked as smaller June, I worked to the whole day in my cover and numbers and number of my mother room, and I had took me out of my mother. But I had a lot of electronics.
I took a old cars and a car, and a rather of a motorrad. The motorrad. It's right, or you want to be able to blink.
And I'm best to me a shalter, to a box and out of the light.
This is a small birth of a capture task.
And then I build all of them.
The Solarpanels, the battery who love the battery, the battery. I call it a terrans. I call it a transformator.
And the research less blines.
You see that the birth of the birth of the birds that are coming from there.
And so it looks like this, if they come from the solve.
The light blinks and the lions and the lions I think that I was about the stall. Thave.
Thank you.
I have this solided to home installed and since we had no problem with lions.
And then our nights our nights.
One of them was this great grandmother.
They had a lot of her tirelores and they fraged me if I fraged her light installed install.
And I said, "Yes."
I mean, I can see the light. They can see the lions of the lions.
And so I've been able to surrounded in the neighborhood and they really work.
My idea is now going to be now in the whole cells, but also for other robots like Hyes or Leoparden. The lights. The lights. The lights.
My experience to me to a stipip with a stipip of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse, and I'm really excited to be really excited.
My new schools and holds and hilders and hilders and creating.
I've been so free friends with home and went to home and I've got to still the light, where you don't have to show you how to do people, and I'm going to use them.
A year I just a year I just a year of Savanne, who was high school. I saw my fly. I saw myself and said, "I'm going to sit me, "I'm going to sit up!"
And here I'm going to take.
I thought with a flyinger, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a great flying airplane and pilotent. That's my great Tumum.
From I have lions, I can go through my experience, but I can return my vaters and the carry, and the solution, and we can relate the side, and we can live without side the side of the side.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I thank you very much.
You know, you know, it's not like to hear it's a story like your story.
So you're going to have this stip. Ja. Yes.
You work on other electrical experiences.
What's the next thing?
My next experience, I worked, I work worked on a real electrical functrical caunctroza?
Yes, I know, electrical founds are hard to read my own, but I want to have my own.
You're going to have a time, you're trying to try to say, "I'm trying to get the visit, but because I'm going to get back.
All of afterward. Richard Turrench, you're a very bonderful.
We're going to be drawing your way to reference, my friends.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm an old enough, a camera in the camera in the camera, but my passion. But I want today with you today with you 15 lowerful, and no one of my favorite.
There was no kind of director, no stilists, no chance to be a chance. Nothing a picture. Nothing was really important.
And to be able to be able to be created by the most common animals,
My story begins when I was a vortraged in New York, and my wife, and my wife, I was on my first day, I was on my poorest, we were on my poor. We were on my poor. We were five.
And so we were later, we were recording in New York and so decided to be a picture.
Now, you can see that you can see the walk.
When the third violence of my daughter said, "Hey, why was you know, why don't you know, "Hey, and it makes a vather and do it a vather to father to father?"
And so we started to make sured to make animals tourists of us to make a picture of us.
You know, it's notice as universe, like university is the law is a free-digman camera.
Nobody has no one who has no one of the clucky, and it's also never been done with our camera.
And so we knew we didn't know how much these receives our lives.
This recently is very hard today.
This is only one weeks after the 11. September, and I had to understand what happens to do is that a five-year-old, so that's what it can understand it.
These are much more than just a final moment, or a moment, or a best moment, or a best.
They're also a possibility for a weeks in the october of time and how we change our time and how we change our time, but we don't just physical, but in all the time.
Because if we do that, we're always make our perspective of mal. While they're always always remembers, and I'm always seeing their eyes, and how they see it.
These are very intensive time we're going to spend with each other, and every year we've been doing it.
Letts, while a our receives, we went to talk about a suddenly, and suddenly as they're going to show them how they're going to show a red pupplices as a smaller than they were smaller than smaller.
And they tell me about their feelings that they had been five years ago, when they had been exactly the same thing.
