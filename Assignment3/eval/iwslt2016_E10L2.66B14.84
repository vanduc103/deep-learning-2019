When I was 11 years old, I was 11 years old, I was brightfaller fire.
My father hearded his little, gray, gray radio the news.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual, because it was pretty unusual message,
He called "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father was very happy.
"Well, you can go to a real school," he said.
I'm going to forget about to forget.
A big school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and they brought it was girls to school.
So I was smart, I five years, I five years, and I started my older sister, and I started to go out of the sister sister, to a secret school.
And so we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way, so that no one could never get a different way.
We hidden our books in the books in the efforts to do this as if we just walked to go.
And we were in a house, we were in a house, about 100 girls in a small to a small to a small to a small to a small to a small to a small to a small to a small to a small to a small town.
In the winter, it was incredibly hot, but incredibly hot.
We all knew that we all knew our lives: teachers, teachers, students and our parents.
And over again, the university had to be able to do a week, because the Taliban, because the Taliban.
We never were never safe, how much they knew about us.
Does they were?
Do they know where we live where we live?
We had fear, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a big happiness in a family, in education as important as important and daughters.
My grandfather was his time.
Aside outside a couple of a fear province Afghanistan. He was best, his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my daughter -- took his father.
My gave mother, but my mother was teacher.
That's them.
Two years ago, she went to the restand, just to turn our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here was the first -- the first in his family who ever received a school sculpture.
And it was clear that his children would be a children would get an education, but also his daughter, despite the Taliban, despite all the risk of all the risks.
He looked like a much larger risk of risk, his children don't go to school.
I don't know exactly that I was in the Taliban sometimes, sometimes, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective.
I was a good luster, but my father said, "Thather said, "Thather, you can lose your life.
Your money can be done. You can be done. You can be distributed in war.
But one thing is going to stay at you, what's going to stay with our blood, and even if we're going to pay for your blood for your blood for your blood, we're going to do that.
So -- do you want to give you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I was grown up through decades,
Less than 6 percent of women have age of my age, a higher than the second graduate, and if my family, and if my family for my school, I would have a strong for my school.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proudlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather who was my grandfather who was gone by his family, because he's been gone to school, one of the first, one of the first, one of the first, one of the first, one of the first, one of the first,
He doesn't just punish with my high schoolables, but also I was also the first woman, and I'm, and I'm, and I'm going to drive it with cabular.
My family believes me.
I have a big dreams, but my family has greater dreams for me.
So I'm global message, I'm a global message for 10x10, a global campaign of women.
So I've helped to give SOLA, SOLA, and maybe some in Afghanistan, afghanistan, a country where girls are still a country where girls still for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school students with great ears with great ears, all of them.
And to see how their parents and fathers and dads for her parents, and I'd also drops for me, and defending all the way.
So as Ahmed. That's not his name, and I can't show his face is not ahmed, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Approached a month, and heavilable on the home of SOLA in her village, and they're the streets of the streets are just about a bombs.
When he got home, he got the phone, and he sounded the phone, and he sent him, if he sent me to school, he would try to school, they would try to start to try to stop it.
And he said, "Does me, if you want to put me, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughters on playing your daughters and overcome."
What Afghanistan, I realized something like this, I realized something that's going to be able to be awesome of us, most of us, the success is a father who's a father who's a father who is their success is that their success is that their success is that their success.
That's not succeed that our mothers don't play a very important role in our success.
These are the people who are increasingly the ones that are starting to a lot of a much more promise of their daughters. But in a society as the future of their daughanistan is the invisible.
Our the Taliban, only hundred girls to school -- because it was a girl -- because it was the girls.
But today, in Afghanistan about three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America,
The Americans are recognize how we're such changes.
I'm noticed that the change of during the during and changing the America,
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I'm a students in my schools, and their parents who are a lot of their parents that they're going to be a lot of promise, I see a lot of future and a long time.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unknown possibilities, and I remember every day, and I remember the SOLALA.
And just like I have a big dreams.
Thank you very much.
All I do, I'm doing, even my life -- my life -- my life -- my life in Africa as young man.
In 1971, in 1971, I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria, Algeria, Algeria, algeria, with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project that we put on the legs we were on the legs,
I was doubt.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people and good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we were doing everything we were starting to do.
Our first project, which is my first book, which is my first book "Ripples," inspiring," inspiring, one that we wanted to show how food is built to show how food is built.
We came with Italian Saatgut in South South South South South Asian Tal, which leads to the Sambesi flying the same population of the series and doma and doma and doma and doma and doma and doma.
Of course, the answer to the antsolutely not interest in it, so we pay for the work, and sometimes they were doing it.
We were amazing that it was in a soonomy talible tales.
But instead of asking why they were nothing to say, "God, we just said, "God, we're just here!"
"Greatening the right time to save people save the people to save the people of the collection."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, we had this practice, they were so big, they were so big,
We couldn't believe it and said, "Sambian, "Sooking, how easy."
When the tomates were red, and red, about 200 night, about 200 nights from the river, and I asked everything.
We said to the seeds, "Oh God, God, God, the Nilpfering!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have a country here."
"Why don't you told us?" "You're never asked us."
I just thought we were just like, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did what the Americans did what the Englands, what the French, I saw what they did, I was pretty proud of what she did.
We felt like the nilmaking film.
They should see the uncomfortable -- you should see the uncertainly, which we didn't see anything.
They should be the book "Dead Aid" of Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a Sambian economist.
The book was published 2009.
We have the countries have given the African continent 1.5 trillion Euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been doing this money.
Lesply you just read her book.
Les you read about an Africans we have a story.
We western people are vast, colonialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, and we're patronizing them or we're patriarchal.
Both words come from the latinical root, which means "pather" means "Father" means.
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalian: I'm treating everyone each of another culture, they'd love you told you."
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone each one of the other culture, they would be my service.
That's white people are called people in Africa, Chef, Chef, Chef,
I was growing up when I was a book, when I was a book, "Small is Beautiful," he said, especially, if people don't want to help people don't want to help.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is respect.
Today, the morning of the heart of the morning, and headed a stab on the ground, and asked, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocolonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react with people, and he was a system called companies, and he never motivated a little bit of a service, no one's never going to be motivated, but you're going to be the villages of the villages of the villages of the villages of the vill
What you do -- you do -- you're going to do.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're going to put together with the marriage.
We don't work from office.
We meet ourselves in Caf<unk>s. We meet us in Kneips.
We have no infrastructure.
We close friends and find out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give someone else.
If these person doesn't like this person?
The passion for the passengers is the most important thing.
The passion for the passion for the most important of humanity.
We help them find the knowledge, because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea has not the idea, but it's not the knowledge,
A lot of years ago, why I had this instead of community instead of saying, why don't we hear about why don't we hear them in community? But not together.
Let me give you a secrets.
There's a problem with community.
And they never have never been part of the time, and they're never going to be able to do with their money to see what they're going to see.
Planation has this blind flat.
The most farming people of the community, because they never knows because they never seem to be able to meet.
We're working to do something to do this, to do this, we need to do that, social infrastructure that doesn't exists who are not existed.
A new profession has to be created.
This is the house of the company, the house of the bed, who's in the house, who's in the caf" and in the caf" and help you help you help you help you to transform your passion in a way of transforming to transform your passion.
I tried this in its operance, West Australia,
I was promoved at the time, and I tried to decline where we're going to do other things that they're going to do.
And so I was just waiting for the first year, and I had the first three days, and I was going to help him. I him. He was called him. He was called Maori. I was mori. I was mori. I him, and I would sell him to organize and organizing.
I think that fishes to work with these fishes and helped these wonderfish thunfish thunfish in Albany for 60 cents<unk>Kilo, but after Japan for 15 dollars, and they said, "Kilo.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government came up to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I hold the mouth and hold them."
So -- so -- so, the government, "Make it again."
We've done it in 300 communities.
We have 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are increasingly.
Peter printer, one of the best companies, one of the story, starting with 96 years ago.
Peter pressor was philosophy professor, before he was businessor,
Planation is the death is the death of the entrepreneurs.
So you build Christch, without knowing what the most farming man who want to study without their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to learn how to get to get to a little bit.
You have to give them discretion and privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them. You have to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
What do you have today, what do you have tomorrowded today?
<unk>respective, they have applauded people.
I want to say that companies are the right way of the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial Revolution -- nights are fossil fossil fossil fuels, and suddenly, and systems that are not sustainable.
The connection of the powerful machine is not sustainable.
The Freon-Artronics is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we need to look at seven billion people on sustainable ways, holds, cure, correspond to correspond to them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will this technology for the green revolution? Universities? Universities?
The government? Can you're forget!
It's going to be entrepreneurs now.
I read a terrible story in a futuristic magazine years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to city, to city the future of the city of New York in 1860.
In 1860, they came together and speculated in 100 years, and the city of New York, and the city was a slide of New York, the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They saw the curve, and they said, if the population in this tempoint, they needed to be six million population, they needed to stop the people, and it would be impossible to be able to be able to be able to be finished by six millions of six millions of six mill
Because they went on the master.
1860, they see the bad technology that life from New York,
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001, there were 1001 cars -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology, the race, the race. There was tiny little factory in the backland.
Down Born, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing has to be distributed to them.
And they don't come to talk to you.
The next thing you have to do is absolutely engaged and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the smallest company, all of the biggest company, three things that needs to be able to sell this: that's got to be selly, the market, the market, and the financial and the financial.
Do you want to give you?
We never met a single person who can sell a simultaneous person can be selling around the money.
That's not exists not exists.
This person was born.
We have researched the researchers and the 100 iconic companies, Westinghouse, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford the new companies, Google, Google, Google, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Google, Google, Google, G
There's only one thing that all successful companies have been a common, just one: No, just one: No one person.
Now we teached 16-year-old in Northumberlands, and we start to start with the business of Richard Branson Autobiography. The first two side of Richard Branson. The task of the 16-year-olds.
Nobody called "ich" and 32 times "wir"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody green found a company. No one. Nobody.
So can we create a community, in the middle of the middle of a smaller, in Caf<unk>s and bars and bars. They're going to do for them. They're going to do for these gentleman, which is someone who's talking about this eposed to you.
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you sell the money?
"Oh, no, no, I can't you." "Mo you know that I find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers that can be support the companies that can help them to help them to help them to help them out to help people. We found that the wonderful population of the intelligence of the intelligence, and the economic population, and the economic pope.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I have to be experience, alice in the wonderland.
The Penn State University, a doctor of communication -- a doctor -- increasing engineering in communication.
I had fear.
Right fear. Fear of this students with their big brains and their big brains and their books and their books and their books, and their books.
But when the conversation, the conversation, he went down to me, when they looked down to the cannines and a door, and a door to a door.
And I felt like I felt when I was talking about the students, I was amazing. I was amazing about the idea that they had discovered that they had discovered that they had to discover the other one of these wonderful.
I think to open up to open this door, it means to open up.
We need to be incredible communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the largest problems, like the largest problems, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and I don't think it's not going to believe that it's not a non-ware of our responsib
But these great conversation doesn't come to the scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers are not in their wonderland.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, please.
I want to show you a few anti-shaps, how to do it, we can see that science and the technology, and the technology, and the technology and spaneously, sexy and spaneously.
The first question that you have to answer is, is, right?
Says us, why is you're just so relevant for us.
Don't just say that their draws are studying us, but also tells us that their draws that you can treat the machine in our bones, because it's important to treat open up and understanding oil.
And if you do that, what you do is you do is you make sorry.
Afterwards are a hands of your minds.
Surely, you could use your doctors, and why don't you use, but why don't you just say, why and time, what is much, what is much, what is much, what is much, what is much, what is much, what is much, what is the time?
Our idea of your minds are not the same thing as their nive, is not the same as their nive.
As one is, like, "Make the things like, "Make things like that, but not easier."
You can tell us something about your scientific area of scientific area of scientific areas of compromise to be able to do without compromise.
A few things are couple of things are crazy: For examples, stories, stories.
And if you presented your work, then the stories, then the stories.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's called "Stich Point."
What happens when someone else is going to be else? Another one is going to be the first place, and with these points.
A follows like this is not just long, but it's also slowly language, but also too much of our brains, and so we're fastly overforce.
This example of genes of genes of genes is much effective bread. It's much more effective structure of the trabele of the trade of trade, that it's the inspiration for the inspiration for the only thing that was the inspiration of eggggggggging.
The trick here is to use a single simple simple sentence, which is losing to use the audience, if it can be losing the facilitating and graphs and graphs and graphics that are also making our other senses, and it's a deeply drawing a deeply distance
These are just a few anti-shels that can help us see the door, and the wonderlands and the technology and technology and technology.
And the engineers I've been teaching me, I've been taught me to make me a nerd in me, I want to make all the way to make anything with a equation.
And you can see, your science of your science and your stories, and your multiple fields, so that's the relevance, so the audience, and multiplicated the whole thing to do for your passion that's incredible working for your incredible work.
So scientists and engineers and engineers, if you've solved me, it sounds me.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handyridge, you can films of humanity in Syria.
With a handy, you can tweet a message in Egyptian and a protestaction in Egyptian.
And with a handy, you can take a song, you can take a songs, and you're going to be famous.
All of this is possible.
I'm a year in 1984, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in those city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people, and as hundreds of thousands of people, and the street.
We're in 1989, and we're in 1989, all these people who had involved on the pockets, a handy in the pocket.
Who in the Saal has a handy on the same?
Hold it up.
Hold your handy, you hold it up.
Hold it up. One otherwise, a blackberry, wow.
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830-20-miles.
Roh data.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.K.
This direction is called the right line is the right line of the current.
And this direction is that every phone calls every phone in Europe, every Internet europe, every Internetd Europe, a bandwidth of bandwidth.
Who is it going to be? Who do you send a email?
Who do you send a text?
And if you use a handy, where you are.
All of these information are going to be at least six months to two years of your phoneths, or your phone company or your Internetanbieter.
And everywhere in Europe, and people said, "That's not going to be."
They said, we wanted to do this idea of the process of significant.
We want to be self-driveness in digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet and Internet, and we need to store all of these information about us.
There were a lawyer, journalists, Priester who said, "That's not going to want to say, "That's not going to want to be."
And here you can see how 10,000 people on the streets of Berlins, and said, "Freedom, "Freedom."
And some people said, "Oh, this could be stasium 2.0.
The state was the secrets in Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern.
And I'm wondering whether this works really working.
Can you really all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone called my phone called Germany telecom, who was the largest telephone, and I asked her, and I asked her, and I asked them all information that I'd asked me all of me.
And I asked her, she asked her, and I asked her, and I got no real answer.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life, because it's my life.
So I decided to do a point of views, they wanted to have this information because I wanted to have this information.
But the Germany said, no, no, no, we're going to give you this information.
At the end of the end of them.
I'm going back to the ancient information where they send me all the long information.
Because in the twish time, the boundary coverage of the E.U., the increasing the E.U.,
So I got this half of this half of the half of the center of CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 colonies.
First of all, I saw it, and he said, it's hold a huge datei.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this dial.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I start with this?
Because you see where I'm sleeping out where I'm going to sleep.
But then I said, I want to go to the publics.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what the people who are insight means.
So without the online and open data City, so I've data City.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reincooms and out and out and out and out and back and back and back and back and back.
You can do any step that I do, you can do.
And you can see how I can see how I'm going to see how many terms of the colds, and how many calls.
All of this information is possible to this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just like, and I called me, and we talked me, and we talked to each other.
And then I called me a few friends, and they called apart.
And after a while you call it, and you called this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they communicate apart to bring to bed.
You can see all of you can see all.
You know, you're going to see the central figures, about who are the leaders.
If you have access to these information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect defect defined as you can grow up a society because you know who's talking about who is who is possible to be a email, all of that information.
And these information are going to be at least six months, in Europe, in Europe.
As I start to start thinking that all of these people in the streets in the street in 1989 cell phones in 1989 cell phones in her pocket.
And the stasize of who had been in the demonstration of the demonstration, and if the stasi, who would have been done who would never have been happened.
The case of the mountains of the mountains may not be instead of states.
And also, not the case of the ice case of the ice.
Because today, because of the state and companies like so many information, how they want to get online and often about us, online.
They want to have the opportunity to follow our lives, and they want to be able to store.
But self-dimension and a life in digital time in digital time.
But you have to fight for the self-based self-down.
They have to fight every day, you have to fight.
So if you go home, you say, you say that privacy is that privacy is a value of 21st century, and that's not old modic.
If you go home, you say, you're going to have to say, just because companies and state state, and state the possibility, they don't have to store it.
And if you don't believe me, you're asking your phone calls information that they've been talking about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you use your handy, you remember the self-by-based self-down time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoes, fastaurants, bridge, bridge.
So the city planers are meeting and thinking about the name South Central South Central to change it, so he's changed him in South Los Angeles, when that's changed in the city, which is wrong.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spiritual laws, fastrestaurants, breaking breaks.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food of the food western South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Driva and the drive-bys.
The comics is that the drive leaderships than the drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles,
The fatty is fourth rate in my fourth is pretty much higher than about five times higher than about 15 kilometers, which is about 15 kilometers.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how to feel like you wouldn't have access to healthy food if you'd have access to the house, if you go out of the house, the negative effects that are best expecting the best Earth.
I'm going to sell that role, and I selled and selling like buying books.
I see dialyzentary seconds like Starbucks.
And I've got to stop that this has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no lustered, I had no lustered to 45 minutes to get apple to get apple, who's not with pesticides.
So I plant a food variety of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call parkanles.
It's 45,000 feet.
The thing is, the thing that is, it's the city.
But you have to fit it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to kep it in stands."
And I decided to keeep it into standard.
So I got and my group that came together, the L.A. Green grounds, and we started to plants, and we started plants, and own program, so that's all the program, so that's all the program, so that's all the program.
We're a kind of an idea of garden group, and we're going to be city, and from all the social stories, and it's completely volunteer, and everything we do, and everything we do, and everything we do.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone who was a guy.
The city came up to me and he came up with me, and he said that I had told me that I have to have my general public relationship.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A richeral approaches of food vehicle for food, is not country that's greater?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times winds, and Steve Lopezzz, and he spoke about it, and talked to the city and talked to the city of Green Green Green Green Green Green, and with 900 difference, we were successful.
We thought you were in the hands.
My city strate, and he said that they're supporting it, and I love what we do.
So why would they shouldn't they do that?
L.A.A. in the United States, most bridge of the bridge of the city.
They have 67 kilometers.
These are 20 central Parks.
That's enough floating to plants to plants to plants.
Why would they find that to the task?
And by the construction of a plants, you get 1,000 sample.
With green boat in the value of a dollarship, you get own to the value of 75 dollars.
It's my holds, I'm going to build their own food.
His own food is like his own food is like his own money.
Look, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I grew up there.
And I remember that part of this previous reality, and I was made by other people who were made by other people, and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I plant my art.
And just like a graffiti artist, the walls, the walls, I'm beautiful, I'm going to be rides.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of pieces, and the trees are my dreams for these stuff.
They would be surprised what the earth is that if you use it as a legs.
They can't imagine how amazing a sunlums, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I experience, like my garden, like my gardence for the education and the relationship, and the distribution of my fourth.
To change the community to change the community of the ground of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wonder how kids are going to be influenced.
Gardenerapists is the therapists and care about the most care of the city that you can do, especially with the city.
And you get the extraordinary.
I remember this time when this time, when these mother, and her daughter, it was about 10:30. They were in my garden, and I got out of my garden, and I looked like this.
I felt really bad, I felt bad, because they were there, and I said, "You know, you know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been watching people who were looking at people who were so close to do this, and that's just asked me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid of your fear."
And I said, "There's no, no, no, no fear that she's not afraid of what claims.
And it's the street.
That's the idea.
I want to take it back, but I want to take them back to the same time, I want to take their health."
At the other time, I put a garden in this observed L.A.
These are the guys who have helped me to definitely.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it was influenced and how they plant them with her mother and how they plants and her grandmother, and it was great, and it was great for a moment.
Green Green Gardens has plants.
And our environmental actions, and we got so 50 people, and they were all volunteers, and they're all volunteers.
If kids carbon, children carbon.
If they turn tomates, they eat.
But if they don't get anything about it, if they don't get together when they're not going to eat the body and body, they're blind, they're blind, they're blind,
I see young people who want to work, but they're working in this thing -- I see -- I see, I see, I see, which is exactly on the path, and they're not going to be in the path.
The gardens, I see as a children where we can train them as a children to care about their communities to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carver.
But if we don't change the collapse of the Earth, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole we can share apart plants where people can share the food of the same block.
I want to take shipscontainer and turn them into healthy caf<unk>s.
So, don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free shit, because free, because free.
The comics is that you have to sustainability to sustainability.
I'm talking about to give people, and children from the streets, and they're going to street the streets, and the honor, and if you built your own food, and if you built up, and if you builts.
So what I want to do is to do is to do is to do.
I want to say that we all ecological rebells, gangster, gangster, gangster.
We have to turn the picture of ganger.
If you're not a gangster.
Are you going to be clearly?
And let's make the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet with meeting, you don't want to go to the caves, and you want to make a meeting and a meeting, where you want to talk about it.
If you want to meet meet meet your garden, you can go to my garden, so we can plant to plants.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "snollygoster," means "one unliker."
Although, although, a magazine definition of a better definition, "Ein Snollygoster is someone who is someone who is a bit of parents, independently, program or line, program or line, and his success, and his success, and his successfulary, and its
I don't know what "speakeral" is.
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians know that they need to try to control the language.
For example, for example, for example, the British plament, the British plament, the same words.
And that was actually back to the mother was back to the mother of a man who was extraordinary names Brass Crosby who was brass Crosby,
She was helped him in the Tower of London, but he was mutigrade, he was mutigrade, he was mutigrating, and he was so much in London, he was so much in London, he won that he won.
And only a few years later, we find the first next motion for the first neighborhood.
Brasses are related to the English word for blech.
But that's not true. It's not true. It's going back to a press.
But to show you how words and politics and politics, I want to take you into the U.S., I'd like to take you on the time they're just reached the independence.
You saw the question of what you should call George Washington, the state of the state of the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leadership of a republic nation?
And that's been debate in the Congressed in the Congress.
And there was all sorts of possible for all sorts of possible proposition.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvern Gouvernor, and others, and others, and others, and others, and others, and other, and other, people of America's Watston.
Not so a presence.
Some people just wanted to call it King.
They thought that's been moving.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king time time time time time time time time time.
It would have work.
But everyone was incredibly boring, because this debate, because these debate three weeks.
I read the days of a senator who wrote a senator who said, "Immer's the same issue.
The reason for the public for the long time, and the long time, the representative.
The representative house didn't want to do that Washington. They didn't want to do it.
Canig, and I'm going to take him on ideas to be able to bring it to his neighborhood.
They wanted to give him the most fear, the most farmful title, the most of them.
This title was "President."
President. They didn't existed the title. He existed. But he was existed. But he was a translative.
This is what the same thing about a Jury.
He had no longer than the terms of "Ancility" or "Aufpasser."
Sometimes, there were president smaller colonial community and governments, but it was really an inevited title.
That's why the senate of the senate.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him president.
This guy has to describe the definitely and out of the countries.
Who will take him to take it, if he's a dumbling small title like President of America?"
And also, after three weeks, the senate of senate.
Instead, you know, the title of the title of the title of the minds, but they wanted to use the other clearly, and they didn't want to be a non-down perspective respects and methods and methods.
You can learn from three interesting things.
First of all, and I think that's the best -- until now, I don't have ever been done before the senate of the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title, just waiting the title.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something temporary -- then you were waiting 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the Title "President of the United States," is not so clearly today, right?
This has more than 5,000 nuclear potentials that he has to do, and the largest people who he has a physical economy of the world and a phone, and this whole stuff.
It's really given the title of the title.
And so the senat at the end of the end.
They have a respectable title title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of property -- now it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the cling of the classrooms with the 5,000 nuclear panels, and so on.
So at the end of the senat and the representatesentation, because no one has losted to be the representation, if you're going to be a talking about the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take with, and I'm going to do with.
Politicians trying to use words to control the reality and the reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, but actually change the reality of reality, the reality of reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebels in a laster of fighting dirty of Dipperad, from Jacksonvillegetaric surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I thousands of my black conversation of half of a couple of latester, and I could celebrates a rocket, and I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.

But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to stand up here, I'm going to be southeast Afghanistaneist, atheist and atheist and atheist and atheist, atheist, who's been working in Afghanistan, and worked in Afghanistan, and worked.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do is to make arts that you could do a lot of greater, but I don't want to make art, I want to make arts that personality and authority and authority and authority and cars.
I want to spend a day in life of a dihad -- Gangster who spend his dictionary, who's gangermunists like <unk>Popstar Bling" and popular black and political corruptions and political corruptions.
And what else can do is doing is to candidate the Parlament, and a choice, and a choice campaign and a choice with the Slogan: "Well, I'm rich."
And trying to use these campaign to detect these magnitude that are being a national heroes.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, and they're going to go to a project called "Riness," which is a policemicist, a wrong control of cabularly control of cabulars and cars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan, I went to the "modic conflict,"
The war, the war and the foreign approaches that were created with him, a new environments and models and models that you can only create a models, by building a models and self-mocolates and self-making away from the aircuitry of aircle of a mod
And I would like to see how a simple simple simple simple simple piece of cabulation, and to create appelling a dialogue of this today, today, today, and they've been colonials in the last colonial retor of the red line of the red last colonial reds
But for all of these things, you can get into prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be misunderstood.
But I have to do it because I have to do because I have to be lost itself.
That's my last. What is your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since a time, I've been working as a model.
Since 10 years, right?
I have the sense of the space, I've been built up here in spanning, because I wouldn't have this clothes.
Fortunately, I've been a little bit to the way.
This is the first time that someone on the TED stage on TED stage, so you can value, so you can see, so I think you can think.
If you were really excited about women, when I got to say that, when I got to say that now, I don't need to twitter.
I also realized that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds, which I can think about what you think about myself.
And that's not everyone has the chance.
These device are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to be such as well.
The most difficult part is to pullover about my head, because then you're going to be able to start to make me out of my head, so long as head.
In order to do that.
Why did I do that now?
That was pleasure.
Well, it wasn't so please as this picture.
As a powerful, but a voice, but a voice.
I've just changed your opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photograph, I said, I would allow my back and with my hand in my hair in the hair.
And then, from operations or the wrong bridge that I was wrong for two days ago, there are only very few possibilities, there's only very few possibilities, and our extraordinary, although it's own lives.
It's to be honest to be honest for me to be honest.
And I'm standing on this stage, because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage, because I'm a hut, and I know a woman, and we call this a sexy girls.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always asking me to the real way.
The first question is, "How will you be a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, is a material lottery and a mattery and maybe you're wondering what this experience is that experience.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have beauty, well, and young and young and young, we're defined, we're biological programmed, but as big, and biological programming, feminally, feminally, feminally,
This experience was created for me. And it's a representation that's a result.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Naomi, Tyra.
And first of all, I'm going to comment your model science. Very pressure.
But unfortunately, I have to share that in 2007, a very excited Doctorand of the NYU all models on the running, every single one that was book, and that was book, and that was books were books.
The next question that will always been asked me, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm a model?"
And first of all, I said, "I don't know, that's not because it's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to girls that I want to girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all going to be.
You can be president of the United States or the inventor of the next Internets or a Ninja Herzchirurg Dether, because then you would be great, because then you would be waiting the first time."
If they still say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I want to be a model," I want to say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility and you could be the head of American vogue or the business of American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next steven Meisel.
And you say that you want to say that you want to say that you'd like to say that you would win to win the Jackpotto,
You can't be influence it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I want to give you 10 years, I want to strate 10 years, because of the monstrate, because other than heartbreaking, it's just just just just just folds.
If there's a photograph, and you can just be in the lights, and then you can just be a nice, and the customeron, and then we want to be a photo in the walk, and then you go to the legs, and then you go to the poor, and that poor, this poor, this arm, this arm, this arm, this arm,
It looks like this.
Hopefully less comic than that.
That was ... I don't know what's happening there.
If you're going to have a lifetime, and a few jobs, you can't be sorry, you can't be a lot. If you're going to be presidentin of the United States, but in life, "10 years," you're going to go to come together.
The next question that's often asked me, "Who are all photos?
And yes, so pretty much all the photos are retuse, but that's just a small part of the story.
That's the first photo that I made a photo that I was also the first time I was also the first time I was a bikiniode. I had no time.
I know that's going to be pretty personally, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me at the day, this shooting.
My friend had to stay with me.
This is me on a pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama.
This is me with the football team and in V-Magazine.
And that's me.
And I hope you can see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's constructs and it's constructs of profession of profession, from Hairs and Make-up artists and photographs and stylists and stylistent and stylistent and the advance.
Okay, when next, people ask me, people always wondering, "We're going to do things about?"
Yes, I have too many 20-cm approach that I can never wear away, but the things I'd never getting things I'm going to get things I'm going to talk about, things I'm not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went to a day, and I went to a lawn, and I had my money. And you gave me the clothes.
As a teenager, I went to my friend, a fear-based driver, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and it took a guilty, and we could go, and we could go on, and we could go on.
I have this cost of my free things because of my personality, and not because of my personality, and there's people who are personality and not because of their personality, and not because of their personality.
I live in New York, and from the 140,000 teenagers who were filmed in the last decided, 85 percent black and latino, and most young men.
It's live in New York only 17,000 young, men's waiting for the question and latino, "Who do I go, "Who do I go to the question?"
It's like, "How often do I'm going to stop? When do I get told?"
And in my rights, I found that talked about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers are not going to be 178 percent when they're 178 percent when they're 178 percent.
The last question is, "How is it, how is it to be a model to be a model?
And I think they expect them, they expect, "If you're going to be a little bit of thinner and longer, you feel very happy, you feel very happy and felt very happy and fabulous and fabulous, and you feel happy."
And Backstage, we give answer that might be able to provide that editor.
We say, "It's really great, and it's greative, and it's greative, inspired, inspired by working."
All that's true, but it's just the story, because what we never said, because what we never said before the camera, what I never said, "I feel like, "I feel like, "I feel safety."
And I feel like I have to think about myself, because I have to think about my looking at my view.
And if you ever ask yourself, "What do I be happier if I had thinner legs and longer legs and longer possible hair?"
And then you should make a few models, because they have the thin, because they have the thin, and the most fastest legs and the most coolest clamots, and they're the most coolest women on the planet.
When I was prepared to this talk about this talk, I've been very difficult to make a real picture, because one of them, because one of them, I felt very uncomfortable, and I got to say, "I got all the benefits of a stackle, and I got all the benefits. And I was felt that I'm going to belie
It was very difficult to do is a very difficulty of inevitably and race, and race a lot of opening user a biggest use of them.
But I'm also happy and feel happy, and I'm going to be here, and I think it's great that I've been able to do it before 10 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 30 years, because I wouldn't tell me how I't me how I't
If you take a little bit of this talk, then we all have the power of the image of the imagination of the imagination and mistakes and mistakes.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother, I never forget that in exilience is, "Son, affordable gaddafire of Gaddafire.
But who never would never be like a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, almost two years, since the libysche revolution is inspired by the waves of the waves of the waves in the Egyptian revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, with many other libyers, and outside Libyens to start a day of the Zorns and to start a revolution against the tyrannic Regime Gadaffis.
And there was a big revolution.
Boy, liby women and men and men and men, the first series, the end of the regimes, hold slogans of the freedom, and social justice, and social justice.
They have example, they've been using mother by using the brutal dictature Gaddafis.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the farming east, from the farmers, until the south.
Finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 deades, and almost 50,000 deads and tyrants and tyrants.
But Gaddafi has a big big big big big basically, a guyrannei, the basically, and the basis of course.
Over four decades, Gaddafis is a gaddafis is the infrastructure, and the infrastructure, and the moral structure of the lybic society.
The consciousness and the challenges, I burned out how much other women, I burned to build the civil society, and we went back to the civil society and we're going to reconstruction and never civily and neverthal equality.
And so, in 200 organizations were during and unmediable to the case Gaddafism in Benghazi.
After 33 years in exility, I came back to Lybia, and with a unique Enthusiasm, I started to the subject of capacity, human development and leaderships and leaderships.
With a wonderful group of women, I found the peace, I women, I women, a movement of women, leaderships, leaderships, and it's approaching the goal of the goal.
And I met the benefits of a very difficult environment, a environment that was always stronger polarized by the egoistic politics of dominance and exclusion.
I was a side of peace and I would have a rather platform Libyscher women to reach a laws to reach a laws, a laws, no matter, no matter, no matter, and to choose the right, and to pick up to the right and citizens to pick up to pick up to pick up with
At the end of our initiative, and it successful.
Women women women women in the National Congresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But slowly, but the euphories of choice, and the whole revolution, and the whole day, we wake up to new new news of violence.
A morning, we wake up to the money about changes and Sufi, and Sufi-Grandian grandchildren.
In another morning, we got news about the morning message on the message and the message on the message.
And again, again, the morning of officiences of officients.
And really, really, we grow up under the milixed military of military understanding the people rights and their power and their power and laws and laws and laws.
Our society, our society, a revolutionary, polarized, polarized by the ideal and principles and principles, social justice, social justice, social justice, social justice she had started.
Intolerance, exclusion and roaches were revolution of the <unk>Following the Iconnected the revolution.
I'm not there today today with the success story of our recipients, and I'm going to choice and the choice.
And I'm going to talk today is that we have a nation that we have a nation that we have been miserable choice and the wrong choices.
We've been set up our priorities.
Because the choice needed for peace, or security or security or security in Lybia.
Have the rest of the rubbers and the way between female and men and menal candidates and national failure?
No, she didn't.
What is it that?
Why is our society is polarized by our society and dominant politics of dominance, and the exclusion of men and the exclusion of men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has missed, but the female of the female of the female of the grand, and the including and the including.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensumption as they brought the choice, and the choice, the polarization and decade, and decade.
Our society needs the qualitative requires the female of the female of the female, quantitative requires.
We have to stop in the name of the name of the torns and a day of the roach.
We need to start to start to action and the grains of the gnade.
We have to develop a female discovers that are not only going to follow the following values, but also too, instead of collaborating, instead of collaboration, instead of course, instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that needed away from warrior of warrior, which needs to do peacebia to reach peace.
Because the peace has a alchemic and in this alchemics, it's about the feminal view of feminal views.
That's the real regular regular.
And we have to do existence, we need to do it before we do it before we do it.
After a transportation of the Coran "Salam" -- "the-down God," "The Godes, raw."
The word "married," and all of the abrahamic traditions of traditions, the same Arabic to the same Arahamic values," and symbolized the word "mbolized the whole feminal feminal feminality, and the whole mankind the whole mankinds of
And just as the motherleible for the embryo, which is growing in him, it's so nutrition of the compassion of the compassion of the compassion of the whole existence.
And so, so, "My gives us all of us, all of us."
And so I said, "My grandmade, my grandmother's got a grand."
Well, we're going to be the grains of the grain.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought, I thought that the best of the world, and I grew up with the song.
And I was very proud of it.
In school, we were looking at the story of Kim Il-Sook, but we learned much about the world, except that America, outside America, South Korea and Japan, and Japanese are our enemy.
Although I was often asked me, I thought, I thought I was going to spend my whole life in North Korea to a whole life in North Korea.
And I saw years, I saw a public habitat, but I thought, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to suffering.
But in 1995, my mother brought me a letter of a warf of a collegin.
And you know, "If you learned this, we're going to be family members, because we've been eaten for two weeks.
We're going together on the ground and our body are so body, we're soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time, I heard about people in my country.
And I went to the Bahnhof, and I saw something horrible, and I didn't see anymore.
A lifeless woman layer on the ground, and a board child in their arm, and a bit of his mother.
But nobody helped them because all of them were all so carefully to care about itself and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hungernot in North Korea.
At the end of the end of the hunger of the hunger of the hunger's victims, and many otherwise, and many otherwise, because they were bugs and tree, and tree.
In fact, it's been highly highly, so that's going to be distributed, except the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the Ufers we live in.
I always wondering why they had lights and we didn't have.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the river, the river, the part of the border between North Korea and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and Ch
As you can see, the riversity can be very similar to be very simply north Koreans.
But many of the same.
Sometimes I saw lights in the river.
I can't say much about how I could say North Korea, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I could say that I was sentence of the hunger.
I thought I was just a short time of my family for a short time of my family.
I never thought that it needs 14 years to live to live together.
In China, it was very hard when young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be like the life as north Korean flying, but basically, but bald, I wouldn't just extremely difficult, but also very dangerous.
So I lived in less fears that my real identity could be fly identity, and you would be in a terrible send to North Korea.
One day, my biggest alptraum when I was biggest alptraum, and I was brought up in the police, and in the police.
Someone reportantly, North Koreans, so they test my Chinese chinese and asked my Chinese and asked me to testions.
I had this fear, I thought I was going to explodate my heart.
Would be sort of unnatural, I could be embrace and absolutely being able to be able to do it.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I was able to control my feelings and responsible to control the questions.
After she was done with the experience said, "That was a false, a false.
It's not a North Korean."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Korean in China in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, and they're going to be adult and absolutely expecting.
These girls had girls.
Although they were expecting, they were free, they were free, they were free international pressure.
These north Koreans didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, every year, until the North Korean in China, and after North Korea, where they followed to be embrace or public,
Although I had lucky, I had a lot of other north Koreans don't know.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to be survived and hard to survive.
And then they learned a new language and worked and worked in a moment on the world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the hidden of the hidden of the South Korea, and I started to go back to South Korea.
Mich in South Korea never might have been a bigger challenge, when I thought it was a bigger challenge.
English was so important that I had to start learning my third language,
And I've got the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Koreans, but inside the inner, we've been very completely out of 67 years of part of the part of 67 years.
Identity through a identity crisis.
Are I south or North Koreans?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no lander, there was no lands.
Although I was approached to the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the task for the university.
And just as I was living in my new life, I got a shock, I got a shock.
The North Korean testing the money that I started to sent my family, and as a street, and as a street, my family, and as a street.
They had to fast as possible as possible, so I started to plan.
North Koreans have to be an incredible streets on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to overcome the border and South Korea, Ironically, Ironically to China and I took a plane to China and I made me to the North Korean border.
Because my family literally, I had to literally literally, I had to southern China, and then after Southeastasia.
The bus drives you a week, and we got more fast, and we got more expective.
Once the bus, when the bus, a Chinese police came up with a Chinese police.
He took the exaction of all, and he started asking questions.
And I didn't understand Chinese family, I thought they would be family.
When the Chinese practice, my family, I decided told him that she would be decided to him, and I would be dream, and I was done.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, he thought, he was happy.
We made it up to the laotic borders, but I had to start all my money to border the border of Laos.
But even after we had the borders, my family, my family in the family, because of illegal borders.
After I had money, and I had paided money, my family, my family inside of a month, but I was released my family.
This was one of the biggest back of my life.
I had done all done to family to family to freedom, and we were so close to family, but my family, just before the south Korean message.
I went down and I went down between the instruction and try to family, and I tried to family, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money or money or money or money or money or money.
I lost all of my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man, "What's going to go?"
I was completely surprised that a foreign mothers.
In broken English and with a words, and I explained my situation, and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two other north Koreans to get two other north Koreans to get them out of prisoners to get them out of prison.
I thanked him from all heart, and I asked him, "Why do you?"
"I don't help you," he said, "I'm going to be.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The remarkable foreign foreign models for me took a new hope for me took the North Koreans, and he showed me the friends, and he showed me the friendly of foreign and the support of foreign painful community as the national community as the northernational community as
Finally, after our long journey, my family, and I repeated, but the freedom, but the freedom.
Many north Koreans are being done by their families, and as soon as they go to a new country, they start with little bit or not a money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us education, the profession and lots of education and lots of more.
We can also be the bridge of his bridge between people in North Korea, because many of us in contact with family, and we're going to stay with family, and we're going to help them information and money, North Korea.
I had a happiness, so much help and inspiration inspiration in my life that I hope that I'm hopeful north Koreans, with international successful international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful north Korean, in the world, in the world,
Thank you very much.
I just have a bit of a bit.
Please don't tell me that I'm not asked me.
So I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very well.
He can't talk to you, but he's communicating for a way that it couldn't be a way.
Remi white knows what love is love.
He shared it means that it's part of it, and he sharing them.
It's not gone. He's not right at the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and imagine, and just imagine, he never tells you a lyer.
When he songs from our childhood, when he's trying to remember the words that I remember one thing: how little we know about the minds and how little we know about the understanding of the unknown.
Samuel is 16th. He's very good. It's very well.
He's an absolutely incredible memory.
But he's also a selective.
He can't remember if he had my chocolate war, but he remembers, but he remembers of the publishment of every songs that we had a song, conversation we had been in my iPod, as four, as four, as four, as the most four,
Do they don't hear about?
But a lot of people are voices.
And in fact, because their minds don't understand in social version of normal version of normal version often, they're often understood.
But what my heart was municate, and my soul, though, though, though, even though they were not as a similar to be a similar to be autism that it was just autistic and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary.
Well, for those of you who are not so valuable with the terms of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain that social communication, and sometimes learning.
It's extremely different than any individual, it's remio,
And the world's going to be all 20 minutes at a new person autism, and although there's one of the most fastest growing up a fastest causes of the world, there's no known as a cure or healing or healing or healing or healing or healing or healing or healing or healing or health or
And I can't remember the first time I remember when I'm autism, but I can't remember any day.
I was born three years old when my brother when my brother, and I was even born, and I was even a new west in my life.
And after a few months, he realized that he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and actually, and actually, not very interested in me.
Remi, and he lived in his own world, with his own world, and he founded with his own rules, and he founded, like, automobile in a series of the room in a series of what it's going to eat and everything to eat.
And when he was older, he was different, and the differences were different.
But behind the wutanted and the frustrate and the frustrate hyperactivity was something really unique, a remove, a boy, a boy, a boy, a boy that had never been a human who never had never been a human who had never been lost.
And also, extraordinary.
Well, I can't teach you to find out there were some family in my family, I gave me, I wish I wish I was wished that they were exactly like I was.
But I'm going to learn the idea of things that they've learned me to the idea of individuality, communication and I understand that these things I don't want to be normality, and I don't want to thousands of normality.
Normality is that the beauty that we're going to give us the differences, and the fact that we're not different, that one of us, that one of us wrong.
It just means that there's another kind of direction.
And if I could just say one thing to Remi, and to Sam and to you, and then it would be normal.
You know, you're extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a gift, we have a gift, and in all of us, and in all of us, and in all the else of the ultimate opency.
The chance of chance, progress and chance and change in the moment where we try to be trying to be different.
Please -- say, I'm not going to be normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has filled us with edging and curiosity with this photo on the photo on the apple, and with a million seconds, and with a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million times faster, and see the world, but a billion pictures per seconds a billion pictures per second.
I'm going to show you a new way of photography that femto-Femto-Femto-frame technology, that's so fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast
And so we can build cameras that we can look at the absolutely see edits, or without a <unk>-ray body, or without a <unk>-ray body, and really in our body, and really in question, and really in question.
So if I take a laser potentially, and I take him in a billion seconds, and they're going to create a package, I'm going to create a package of photons, and this photons, and this photons, and this photon-paketer, and this project, this project, this project, this pro
So if you take this projectil, this photons, this photons, and it's going to take this photons in these flaps, how are these photons in the flaps?
What's light in timelups?
So this whole eventually event.
So, think about it, thinking that all of the events actually need less than a nanoseconds -- so longer than a nanoseconds to return to the light, but I'm light, but I'm going to see the factor 10 billion, so you can see the light.
No, Coca-Cola has not financed this research.
So, in this movie, so you can analyze this film, and show you what happens.
The puls, our projectil, our projects in the flaps with a photonpaket, and that starts to move around, and that's starting to move.
And part of the light is drawing outside the table, and you see these excuse.
Many of the photons are reaching the last last finally the last, and exploding the flower and exploding directions.
As you can see, there's air, air, which is in the bottle.
As after the waves are going to be the waves on the table, and because of the reflexions of the reflexions of the riversity of the bottlexions on the end of the focused on the end of the bottlexions.
Now, if you take a same projectilure projectil and let it back to the same street and the video back to the factor 10 billion, you know how long you have to slow down here, you know how long you have to see how long you have to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a week.
That would be a very long-term -- from a long movie -- from a long projectil in movement.
And how about something still looks like a still life?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like when you put a set of a teap.
I think it's like this, as if the nature would be a photo mature, the photo, but of course, of course, of course, of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that when you'll see that if the lights the lights, that's going to stay at the point. It's not going to stay.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and the light, and the lights into their lights and after some of the seconds.
So, in the future when this femto-camera in your camera in your camerahandy, it could be able to go to a supermarket, and you can go to a supermarket, and you can touch itself, without touching them.
So how did my team at MIT this camera?
So as a photograph, if you know, if you're a photographically light, but we have a bit light, but we're very little lighter than your current males, so faster than your best money, so well, so well, so well.
So we're doing this projectil, we send this projectil, this photon-packed, and then we'll repeated with very cleverer synchronization, and we're going to combine these femto-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-sideos.
And we can take all of these rows and doing things.
So, superman can fly fly.
Other heroes can make us feel like, but how would it be a new superherocraft for a future for a future surgery?
The idea is that we're going to still door.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it, a part of it will reflect the door, and finally, and finally, and we could use these more simplify these more simples of light.
And that's not a science fiction. We even built it.
On the left is our femto-Camera.
And then the wall is a puppet, and we're going to let the light on the door.
After our department in the Nature communication in the Nature Communication, it was being released by nature.combs, and they've been making this animation.
We're going to take this light projects, and they're going to be able to make this photones, and then they're going to be able to get together, and then some of the photons, and then we're going to be able to turn the light, and then the dreams.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our femto camera has some single camera has some skills.
It has a very good time, and she can look at the world in light, and it can look at the world.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what we don't know what we're heard.
So what do we put a laser on the screen, we can see a row that -- how to see this -- how they see in the screen, but if we look at the screen, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they try together and try together and try together, and they try together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a bit of doing this, we can use the lab, we can use the practice, we can use cars, we can use collisions, and we can see what's going to see, or we can see what we can look forward to look for survival lights, or we can look forward to see that by look forth, by look for surv
But of course, because of the blood, of course, of course, that's why this is really a way to scientists, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, because a new bit of medical processes, because a new medical process of medical definitely,
So, as you know, like, we can do is a scientists, and we can have a scientists, and we can do a art of the ultra-scape, and I realized that all of these gigabytes, and I realized that all of us are collecting all the time we're not just known formating the scientifically a scient
But it's happening here is something funny.
If you look at these waves under the rivers, you can see that the waves of us, you can see that the waves of us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we've been thinking that we've almost in lightness, we've seen effects and Einstein's incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly.
The range of the events in the events in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, so you can see the camera, so by relationships by space and time, we can correct the space and time, we can correct this transportation.
So, no matter whether we should be able to create the create of a new creating probably for the medicine or new demands, and we've been able to requirements, and we all have details and hopefully of our website and hope that we've made us allowed us too
It's about time. Thank you.
There are lots of possibilities, how our lives.
We don't meet any neighbors on the street, so that many wisdoms are not going to use the same public places.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and things like tasks and circles and circles and circles.
The projects of my questions, how much mine as many miets of my neighbors?
How can we teach more things without us to stop us?
How can we share our memory of the memory buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for empty homes, so that our communities, and our communities and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My soul is going to be big embrace the huge effects that have been hundreds of years, bedrowns and dreams and dreams. I've always trust town music.
I think every time, every time someone who never gets in New Orleans a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the world, most of the world, most of America.
I'm going to be able to do this house, and I've been thinking about how I thought I was going to change my life for always changed my life for always changed.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
Yoan, Joan, and she was like a mother for me. You know, and she was suddenly and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death, and I felt a big thankfulness for my life, and I took me clarity about the things that are important to me in life.
But it's hard to me, this view of all day, that we're going to kep it.
It's easy to lose in the Alltaging and forget what really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I relaxed a side of the line, and I wrote a huge tapes, and I wrote a big piece of love, I want to die. Everyone, I want to be a piece of piece, I want to be a piece of piece of piece, I can be
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could expect, but I was just filled the wall, and they were growing up and they're always growing.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the walls that were written by the wall.
"Bevor I'd like to be piracy, I want to be piracy."
"Bevor I'd like to die, I want to stand up the International datums."
"Bevor I'd like to die for millions of people sing."
"Bevor I'd like to plant a tree.
"Bevor I'd like to live, I want to live "netzun."
"Bevor I'd like to keeeeep them in my poor."
"Bevor I'd like to be someone who's going to be someone."
"Bevor I'd like to be myself."
This is after that, this is a sense place, and the hopeful place, and the hope of people, and dreams of people, and dreams, and during the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and increasingly on a new way of undergressive way.
It's about to make place for meaning and remembers and remember what we're most important to remember what we grow up and change us.
I've done this last year, and I've made hundreds of passionate people who wanted to build a wall, and I wanted to build a wall, and I built a boxes, and now I've been built in countries like Kas, South Africa, South Africa, South Africa
We've shown how much power our power public places, if we have the opportunity to share our voices.
Two of the most valuable things we have time, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever looking at the right view of the right view of thinking about it, and think that life is that life is that life is that life is felt that life is.
We're often often recognize the death to think about death or even thinking about it, but I realized that the preparation is one of the death is one of the things that we're most strong.
The idea of death is using death,
Our common places together, which is the best places us as individuals and as a community, and with more possibilities, and with more possibilities, and stories, and they can't just help us to help us better places, they can help us make better places us make us make us make us make
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to start with me, I'm a particular problem for everyone who's a particular problem for each other mathematics is that we're like companies.
Nobody knows what we're actually doing.
So I'm going to tell you the trial to explain you today.
And dance is one of the human activities.
We're returned to the terms of most of the balletting balletting ballettings, as you can see.
At the ballettle of a ballet of ballets of capacity and ability to knowledge and ability to have a basic events a genetic components that could have a genetic components.
Traures, testroy neurological disruptions like Parkinson long-terminson slowly, and that makes them in my recognized Jan Stripling, who was a ballettuose.
Over the years, you have a lot of progression, you've done a lot of progress.
But yet, there's a worldwide 6.3 million people who are living in this disease, and they have to live with the uncredible symptoms like weak, tremor, tremor, and more living disease, and that disease, and so we need to use whether we need to use whether we need to do that dise
We have to measure the progressive measure of measure, and finally, and we have to know if we have a single possibility to know if we have answered that question can answer that question can answer that question.
And the doctors is that there's not a biomarkinson and other movements don't have a biomarker, so you can't just do. The best thing. The best thing that's the best thing that we can do.
You have to do it in clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very expensive, and that's not going to be clinical studies, and never done.
But what if patients could do this test to do this test to do?
That would be a business tour into the hospital tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test?
It wouldn't be a teures hospersonal hospersonal.
It costs <unk>300 percent, 300 percent, in the neurological department.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods that we're trying to do that we're all trying to do that, because we're all trying to get virtuoes like my recognize.
Here you see a video of video of video.
This is what happens in healthy, if someone talked about this speech. We can look at us as a stimming balletting, because we have to coordinate all of these voice, and we have to coordinate the genes, and we all have to do.
And as Ballet, it's enormously a lot of transmission.
Think about how long a child, as long as a child, until it.
And by the loud, we can certain the position of vibrate vibrate, and as the morganization of parkinson's also the voice of Parkinson.
On the bottom of the bottom of unregular voices, you can see a voices.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Immor, swake, sweat, security.
The language is actually afford to the time, and that's an example, and that's an example of it.
These impacts in the voice, and sometimes, sometimes, but with digital microphone and presence, and presence, and presence, combined with new machines, and we can actually be able to do with new machinery, we can now be very exactly incredibly far, we can now, we can now, we
How can you measure these tests with clinical message? Well, they're both of them are both test to neurologists.
And the same thing. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both are exactly. There's not going to be true.
So you can be done by yourself.
They're very quickly, three times 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something extremely billig, you can use it in great big scale.
This is amazing goals with this amazing thing.
We can reduce logistics for patients.
Patients don't have to leadership in clinics.
We can see if we can see if we can get to the objective data.
We can do a green massive massive mass experience for clinical studies and first of all the population of the whole population of the population.
We have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we start today's simming innitiative.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world, to start enough to bring enough exploitation of these goals.
We have a called Ruffering, the dreiving people on this planet,
Everyone, or without parkinson, or without parkinson, to get a few center for a few center. I'll give you a few center. I've been ready for six percent of our goal.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people nail, you can say who is, who is not who is who you're not going to say who isn't it?
What are you going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients have to advance to patient whether these parkinson is suffering or not.
Some of them may not be able to create it.
But we collect a huge database, different database, and we're interesting circumstances are important, because we're important, because we're really important to figure out what the actual markers for Parkinson.
At the time, you have 86 percent gene?
It's much better.
My students -- I have to love him -- I have to love it because he's so fantastic worked on the mobile physical works on the mobile phone networks, and we're going to work with 9 percent gene.
I call this improvement.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handy, and people can do with parkinson, people with parkinson, and they could take their voice, so that you can take their doctor of the disease of the disease of the disease.
That's exactly what we're doing.
Thank you. Max Life, my dads and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenya, I live in Kenyairobi national Parks.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and that's the nairobi nairobi national park.
The Nairobi national park is just in the southern is just immediately. That means that wildlife is that wildlife.
The rabbts, the solutions, they're doing this. And then they do this.
They killed our field.
This is one of our cows that were killed. I was killed. I wake up, and I found it. It was horrible. It was our only bull.
My stamm that the stamm of the massai, we believe that we were collapse with our animals, and so the weirds.
I learned as a children, I learned solutions.
Our warrior warriorans. They're protect our voice and our hearts. They're also brought to be covered by this problem.
and kill the solutions.
Here's one of six solutions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a lot of national Park is just so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years, and nine years, and nine years, so I went too.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Lions. Lions.
But then I realized that this was not really help us see that we help us see the cows, but the cows,
But I didn't go. I went on.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a bird.
I wanted to think that the solution, I thought I was standing up the cow.
But solutions are very smart animals.
They come up, the birds, and you go back. On the next time they go back to the next time, and they say, yes, that's not, that's still not, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
And they're going to kill our fields.
One night, I wake up the case. I went to the carry, and I went around him, and that time, and that time, and that time.
So for the lights for light that moves.
I had an idea.
And I was working as small boy, I worked all day in my room, and I took the new radio of my mother radio of my mother. And I had a lot about electronics. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took an old age-like a direction of a motorcycle. The right or left, whether you want to left or left.
And I was a broke me a switch of lights and out of the lights.
This is a little bit of a box of a bags.
And then I built everything.
The solar panels the battery, the battery, the battery, the battery. I call it a transformator.
And the right thing.
You can see that the births outside, because of the wolves, because of the solutions.
And this is what it looks like the solution, if they come.
The lights blink and the lights and the solution I was about the stall.
Thank you.
I've been installed installed, and we had no problems, we had no problems.
And then our neighbors of it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals, and she lost her animals and asked me if I could install them.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
Since then, I've seven homes in the neighborhood with the lights, and they work really well.
My idea is used to be used to be used to other rabts, as hyenes like Hyenes or leopards, and the lights. The lights of farms.
My invention is a stip of me to a stip of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really excited.
My new schools are engaged and helps and helps and helps and records.
I even brought my friends with home and I brought home, and we're going to be used to show the lights where there's no lights.
A year ago, I just a boy from the Savanne, who was hoping his father Kower, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a sitting in a sitting in a sitting!"
And here's what I'm going to stand up here.
I was to start with a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a big, I want to be airplane and pilots.
I've got a lions, I can go through my invention, but by my invention, I can save the cows and the solution, and we can live without side, side, side, without strips without strangers.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I'm very much.
You know, you know, it's not how to hear a story like your story like your story like your story.
So you've got this stipendium. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next thing on the list?
So my next invention, now I'm working on a electrical funny electrical funny?
Yes, I know, electrical cities are already have invented my own, but I want to have my own.
You've been tried to give it, not trying to give you away, I've been trying to give you a studied, but I was trying to give you a battle.
All the beginning is hard Turere, you're a little bit more special.
We're going to be you in every step to fire, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm old enough to keeeep a camera in the hand, photography. But today, but I'd like to share with you today, and I'm going to share with you.
There was no way of Director, no chance, no chance, no chance, no chance, not even the picture. Not even the picture.
In fact, most of them who were being shots of the most commonly grandmas.
My story begins when I was at New York, and my wife, and my wife, and my wife, and my daughters on my arm. We were at the corner. We were at the corner of 57th.
And so we were a year later, we were going to go back into New York, we decided to shoot the same picture.
Well, you can see what you can see, you can see.
When the third birthday, my daughter said, "Hey, why, why, why don't you sabina, and it makes a father taking a father taking the ritual form to lead the ritual form?"
And then we started to start to make a please tourists, a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal laws are completely fully fully foreign.
Nobody has ever said, no one has ever been said, "No, no one has never been done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rice would change our lives.
This journey is very holy.
This is just after the 11, after the 11, and I had to explain what happened in the day, and I had to understand what happened in the day.
These images are much more than just a far more than just a far more than just a certain journey.
They're also a way to stop a week for a week, and as weeks and how we change our time, not only physical, not only physical, not just physical but in all, not just physical.
Because although we're always doing the same perspective of Mal. While they're always reaching new miles, and as they see that life with their eyes, and how they see it with all about how they see it.
These very intensive time that we spend to spend to be able to provide every year we're expecting every year.
Last, as one of our rice, we went to our rice, and we started to fly, and then they stayed like to stay at a red market, she shows up on a puppet of a puppet.
And she told me about her feelings that she had five-year-olds of these things that she had felt like this.
She said she remembers like her heart from the heart from the breast time she saw the first time she saw the first time she saw the first time.
And now she looks like in New York, because they want to study because they want to study in New York.
And I was clearly clear: The most important thing we all created, memories are memories.
And so I want to share with you to share with you, an active role in the most active role of memory.
I don't know how it looks like it, but I'm looking at this 15 pictures of these 15 pictures.
I'm always the picture.
