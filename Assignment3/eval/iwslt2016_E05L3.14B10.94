When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the clener of the clener free.
My father was hearing on his little bit, women Radio the news of the BBC.
He saw very happy, what happy was pretty unusual, because of the neighborhood was depressed.
He rather: "The Taliban are white!"
I didn't know what that means, but it made my father was very happy, very happy.
"You can go on a right school school," he said, "I'd go.
The morning I'm going to be survived.
All right school.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, and I was six, and I was board to school.
And so I five years, I five years, I five years long as June, and I started my older sister, and I started to go out of your sister, to a little bit of a slime school.
So we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we could never get another way, even never money, where we could never get where we went to where we went to the same.
We had took our books in the left, and we'd looked like this, as if we're just going to go.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 miles in a little wall.
In the winter was, but in the summer, but in the summer, it's incredibly incredibly.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the painting the difference of the difference of a week, because the Taliban power, because the Taliban power.
We were never really, how much they knew how much they knew.
Do they possible?
Why do they knew where we know where we do?
We had angry, but we wanted to school.
I had great great great great great device as important as important as important as important and turned into the picture.
My grandfather was his time.
One of approach of a decided provinced province, he was buying his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- to school and it was dading its father.
My bilks, but it was teacher.
That's what they're.
Two years ago, they went to the ruhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here's the first in his family, the first time, the ever ever sulbation.
For him, it was a clear that his children would behavior, even his taliban, even throts the Taliban, trots all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk of his children, his kids don't go to school.
I know that I'm even knowing in the years, I was in the years ago, sometimes of our lives, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective.
I had good love to give you a good lust. But my father said, "Thather, you can hear me. You can't live in your life.
His money can be done. You can be done in war in war in the war.
But after a thing is always going to be here, which is what's going to do with ourselves, and even if we're going to do with our bubblished for your bubblish.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country on a country that was destroying the war.
When less than 6 percent of my old women have a higher than the seconds than the seconds than the seconds, and if my family, and if my family, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm set up here today, as stolice, as a stoldlebury College.
When I was after Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was my family, because he was a family because he was won't been to school, he was the first send of the first place that was the first thing that was the most greater.
He doesn't just like my high school, but also with my high school, but also the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the first woman.
My family believe me.
I have great trees, but my family has still a greater trees for me.
So I'm global bottoms for 1010, a little bit of the world, a world's a little bit of women.
So I've been helping slide, SOLALA, and perhaps a few internat for mice in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country, and still recants.
It's wonderful to see how the shoes of my school with great early with great early chances all of them.
And to see how their parents and value for them, like this, like this, and I'm also my parents for me, and decided all the ways.
So as Ahmed. This is not really not being name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my south.
And I'm a months were his daughter and he's been in her home in their daughter and they're the tath of the tod, just to get a few minutes.
When he was home, the phone, the telephone and a voice, and a voice, he would be falling him, he would be trying to school.
And he said, "This me now, if you want to use your future, but I'm not going to use my daughters on playing on plays and overcome older and overcome."
What Afghanistan, I've got something that I realized something that's been able totally, most often, most often, most of us, most of us, the success, the father, the father, and the results of his father, and it's also the successful.
That's not shouldn't have to play our mothers in our successful rules in our success.
These are they are half thejects that are possible and overcome to a lot of a lot of a lot of their tests of their tests. But in a society like in a society of the unfortunately of the men.
And the animaliban went to schools, just hundreds of girls -- because it was someone.
Today, everyone in Afghanistan, about three million million million millions.
Afghanistan, he's looking at America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how to change the change.
I'm notice that the change of drawers are not from the U.S. and repeating all over the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I'm snower in my school, and their parents who are sure that they're going to use its a lot of parents that I see a lot of future, and then I'm going to behavior.
Afghanistan is for me to a country of hope and the uncomplications, and it's impossibilities that sounds me every day.
Let me like I have a big trees.
Thank you very much.
Everything I do, also, also my life -- my life -- my life was brought about years of work in Africa than ever man.
In 1971, I see in 197, I'm not -- I'm not -- I've got in Sambia, Kenia, Kenia, Algeria, Algeria and Somalia, alga, alga, algornia, African countries.
I've been working for a full of a nRO, and every single project that we're going to stand up the legs.
I was switched.
I thought, 21 years, we've been good form of good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed all we were all of what we're looking at all.
Our first project, what my first projects what my first book "Ripples of the campaign, a sambas, one, one that we wanted to show the sambasias.
We came with italia Saatgut in South America, in Southambia; in this to Sambia, which leads to Sambia. We live in the same of the analyzian population and data.
Of course, the answer has no interests of interesting, so we're not paying for the work, and sometimes they're also looking at the work.
We were involved that there was so early not a landwareness.
But instead of state why they didn't look at the same time we just say "God, we're just like this!"
"Gerade is right now to return the people to talk about the sambias.
Of course, everything is wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, we had this practice. In Italia, they were so big,
We couldn't believe it and said, "She's skin, like simple country."
When the domata and red, came up about 200 nights about 200 nights, and asked everything.
We said to the Sambi: "Oh God, God, the Nilpfer!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a landware of this."
"Why don't you told us?" "I'm not going to be used to be used."
I thought we were so greated in Africa, but then I saw what the Africa, but then I saw what the Englishers did what the English, which is what the Franzanzo, which I was data, which I was data.
We felt the food to least the nilprofer.
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the university that we don't know the uncertain people,
They should be the book "The Aiddle Aida Moyoyo, she's a sambian economic economic economics.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have the average of African continent 15 million euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money.
Les you just simple.
Les you have a African, what we've been looking at what we've been attention.
We're important people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two kinds of ways, like we're just two kinds of patriarch or we're patriarch.
And the words of the latest of the latest of the latest "Vather" what "Vather"
But they have two different bothes.
Patriarchal: I'm patrian: I love my children, as if they were my kids. "I love my kids."
Patronisising: I'm patronis, when they were my distributed my dyermin.
That's why people are going to be in Africa, Chef, Chef, Chef,

This is the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is Respect.
Today, the herrible of the herr, who's published a stabet, and asked a stabet and asking a state of city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react on people, and he's going to react a system called the companies, and never being in a nobody, but you're going to be a little bit of the possible, but you will be the possible of the pion of the pion of pion, the positional pion of the
What you do -- you do is -- you're going to do.
You're never never been a community with ideas with ideas with the sky.
We're not working from broad.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Cneips.
We don't have infrastructure.
We found friends and find out what the person wants to find out what the person.
The most important is the lesson.
You can make someone else a idea.
When this person don't you do that?
The passion for the own words of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own words is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge, because no one can be anything can be allows.
The person with the idea hasn't have the science, but it's not available.
A lot of years ago, I had this one: Why didn't getting in a community and people to say what they should do? But why don't wearing them? But not in community.
Let me give you a brain.
There's a problem with community.
We've never been part of the time, and they're never been saying what they're going to say what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they see.
Planation has this blindow.
The clearly people who knows the community of community, because they never get to open.
We work to do a sense to do this to do this, to do this social infrastructure, that's not existed.
One new beries, a new ber.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedroom, who's the house, the house, and in the cafic and in the cafully, you're going to find your lives in a way to transform your lives.
I have this in the food, West Australia, trying to try.
I promoved to the time and trying to get the time and trying to say what we should say, what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had just drops the first year, and I had three days, I'd half the first customers, and he was a garage, he was a garage, and I was a restauranta. I was going to go to past a past year and organizing.
I half this fish fish, and I'm working on this wonderful, and that's not at a fish in Albany for 60 cents, but for 60 center for Sushi for 15 dollars for 15 dollars."
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I do something very, very, very swimply.
I half the mouth and highly hope."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Make it."
We've been done in 300 genemal in 300 general.
We've been 40,000 companies are helping.
There's a new generation of companies that are involved.
Peter Drucker, one of the best companies, the story, story, story, a few years ago.
Peter Drucker was philosophy, before he was recognized with companies, and Peter Drucker said, Peter said, Peter said, "The Petermany and economic society."
Planation is the death of the entrepreneurs of the company.
So you built christches to know what the course of human course, which is the most human covers and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get to get this to a totally.
You need to help them disks and privacy, and Privacy. You need to help them to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you're a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the language?
For the presentation of the presentation, you've got today?
<unk>rible, embraded people. The eates.
I want to say that companies to say that companies is the right way.
We're the end of the first industrial Revolution -- nich revolution -- nichels, fuels, and suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly, and systems are not why they're not behavior.
The consumeration is not aftermasis.
The friends of the instands of instandard.
We need to look at how we need to build them millions of people on why we're going to recognize them, transportation, and we can corresponding them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will revolution to the green revolution? Universities? Civersities?
The government? Do you're going to suggests!
It's going to be the companies. And they're going to be here.
I'm going to make a future in a future in a future in a future.
There was a group of experts that were egggela, took the future of New York in the year in the year in the year.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happened in 100 years with the city of New York City was a sluss, the stad of New York City wouldn't existence in 100 years.
Why? You see the curve and said, and they said, when the population in this tempovers in this tempox, they needed to be six millions of power to people to listen to people, and it would be impossible to be able to fight with the power.
Because they went to the mistake.
1860, they see the difficult technology that lives from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, in 19001, there was 1001 Automobilobilher -- 1001, 1001.
The idea that one of technology to find a different technology, the running little bit of little fabrics in the back of the Hinterland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a brain to work with companies to work with companies.
When he needs to be able to do it.
And in fact, they don't talk about you.
When you need to recognize them, engaged and embraded them.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truthority about the companies.
Von the little biggest firma, all of the largest companies, three things that needs to be able to buy the products, the production of his financial production and his financial.
Rata?
We never have a few person who can do a few person who can buy something produce something produce, and we can buy the money.
That's not something exists.
This person was never been born.
We've got research and the 100 iconic firms of the world, Carnegie, Westing, Westing, Edison, Fordon, Fordinary, Google, Google, Yoogle, Yoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed all the successful companies have been a person who was a person: No, just one person was just one person.
Now, we're going to leave the 16-year-old in Northumbers and we begin to start the first two side of Richard Bransonsons Autonobiography Branson Autobiography, and the first one of the first time, the first time it's two-year-olds.
No one time," and 32 mal "wir"
He wasn't alone as he started.
Nobody's a company of a company. Nobody.
So we can tell a community, in the person who needs to say, "Well, the little bars, in Caforestround, and Bars and bars, your engaged campaigns that you're going to do what's going to do with this each other.
What can you? Can you can make it?
Okay, you can buy it? Can you're going to go on the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Mill you ever think I'm going to finish?"
We activate communities.
We've got group of freedoms that can be requirements that can be under the findows and people who have least and people have to help them. We've got the wonderful intelligence of the intelligence of the economics and economics.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be where it's to be age, alice in the wonderful.
The pennity is batching me -- a Dozentin for communication -- at communication -- at the computer in the communication.
I had angry --
Rightly angry. Angstering these students with their big brains and their big big books and their big books, and their big big biggest walls.
But as the conversation of the conversation, he was like Alice as Alice as Alice, as Alice, and a cannins and a terrible new world.
I felt like I felt like I was talking about the students with the students. I was just remember the thought that they had to discovered that other words and wanted to be the other words.
I think it's to publication to open this terms of communication.
We need to change increasing communication of our scientists and including the world to change the world.
Because our scientists and insures are thejects that our biggest problems, like to example, energy, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it. I don't think it's not going to believe that it's nothing in our economy.
But these great conversation come together, if our scientists and including our scientists and in their wonderful.
So scientists and ingency, bits, clearly,
I want to show you a few answer, like her how to make it instants that we can see that the science and technology, and the technology, and spane, since, and spaneous.
The first question that you need to be able to possible, and?
Saybe we're just a serious scientifically, so relevant for us.
Say not just that their drawings are different studying us, but also saying that their draws that their draws that they're in our cooks, because they're important to understand the opportunity to understand the opportunity.
And if you're going to be what you do is doing it, then you're going to be avoid.
For after are a hands of change, for change.
I couldn't be able to survively and pretty much, but why don't you just say, why don't you just change the time, what's much more for us?
Our idea of the thought about how their nive is not the same as their nive.
How one of the other word said, "Mache's just like this, but not just like possible."
You could tell us something about economic scientifically known assume, without the compromise of the compromise of the compromise.
A few things are returning out of it: Because examples, stories and analogies, and analogies, and they could be able to stories.
And if you're working on their work, then the stories, then the stichpoints.
Hab you ever asked young, why it's "Ston's called "St?
What happens when someone is that someone else? One, and with these points, and with these points, and with this point.
A following this is not just long, but also too very long, but also too very language of our brains and dading our brains and dading, we're going to be fast.
This example of general guys of Genevieve Brown is much we showed that the special structure of the special structure of the trabe of the tremendous design of the inspiration for the inspiration of the effect.
The ticks here is a single, simple, just long as a sentence, and the audience that can be audience, if it can be audience, orients can be reading the other senses, and the other senses, and our others are also available of the other senses.
These are just a few answer that can help us to see that type and the wonderful and the science and the science and the technology and technology.
And the inside that I've been undergrounded me, I've been able to make me in my early in my eyes, I want to make all of the same with a same.
So, in fact, the science of economy, and each other, teaching these are able to tell you that's important to say, what's important, and multiplicated the limits of the economics, and the unbelievement. And it's incredible. And inconomics.
So scientists and ingency, if you look at this same time, you're inside me, I'm inside.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy cancer a person in Syria in Syria.
With a handy can make a neighborhood and a protesta work in <unk>gype.
And with a handy can take a long time, it's highly on Sound Cloud and books.
All that's possible.
I'm a year, I'm live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the time in this city.
There's a hundreds of thousands of people for change in the streets and the streets and the constrated.
We're in the hundreds of ourselves, and we've been able to change the cell phone, a handy in the tasks.
Who in the Sala has a handy there?
Hald you're high.
Half you're high, high, high!
Hald you're high. One, a blackberry, which was a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my hand and my handy, and about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
This is 350 cells, 350 ciles of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.
This relines means relines today is relineering.
This relines are best that every particularly in Europe, everyone in Europe, everyone in the entire Europe, a bandbreaker information.
Who do you get? Who do you know, what's a email?
Who went a sMS?
And if you're using a handy, where you're going to be.
All these information will be six months for two years to two years of your telephone or your telephone or your Internet or your Internet.
And everywhere in Europe, people are the people on Europe, "That's not."
They said, we wanted to these imagination.
We want to sure self-bestimation in the digital time, and we don't want to be the telephants and Internets and Internets, all these information about us.
There was applies, Journalists, Prians, Prians, "That's all saying, "That's not."
And here you can see how to see how to the streets of breaking the streets and said, "Freeth of the state."
And some of them said, this could be the stasize of 20.
The stasi was the brain was the brain in Ostitution.
And I asked me to be able to fall, whether it works.
Can you really all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my telephants, the distribution, the distribute telecom, and I was the biggest telephants in Deutch, and I asked them all of me, and I asked me.
And I asked them a time, and she asked them, and they didn't get a right answer. Nures Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bl
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is because it's protocolled.
So I decided to do a general recording to get a sense of these information because I wanted to have this information.
But the distribute telecom said, no, no, we're going to give you this information.
At the end of it, it was to a sense of them.
I'm going back to the future, where they all sorts of information.
Because in the food of the massive of the boundaries that the leadership of the emotion of the E.U.
So I'm going to have this half of environmental environment.
And on the CD was this.
350 cells, 3830 cells.
First, I saw it, and I said, well, it's half a huge. Metweet.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit of skeptic, what should I think about it?
Because you see where I'm where I'm where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information about this information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show the people what I want to show you what is means.
So with the oil oil and open Data City, I've data City.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reince the reinooms and racooms, you can populate back and back to the back.
You can do every step, I do it, I do it.
And you can see how I see how I'm going to see how many free years, and how many of the creates I do, and how many of anrible.
All that's possible information.
This is a little bit of a little bit.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
First, it's just like, I'm going to go and she running me, and we talk about a few mal with no one.
And then I'll go to a few friends and they're going to go.
And after a while you and you've got to go and you've got this huge communication.
But you can see how people can see people with each other, too language, they're looking at a bedback of the bed.
You can see all of you can see all.
You know, you know, the central figures, about who are the leaders of the groups.
When you can see a stuff, you can see what the society is what the society.
When you have a stuff, you can have the society, you can control.
This is a bague for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect eventually, how to be a society about how to reday, because you know, who's a long time, who's a emailic, everything is possible to this information.
And these information will be information for months, 6 months, in Europe, in Europe.
How I said to remember, we're going to be able to record in the streets in the history in 1989 Handys in their tasks.
And the stasially, who was approached to the demonstration of the demonstration, and when the stasius, and then the leaders are never happened.
The case of the Berliner maybe not states, maybe not states.
And also thought that's not the case of the ice.
Because today is state information and companies, so many information, like they want to know how they can wrote about us, online and often.
They want to be able to read our lives, and they want to learn how to read the all of the time.
But self-bestimation and a life in your life in the digital time, not a video.
But everyone needs to be able today for the self-day.
You need to do that every day.
So if you go home, you're going to go home, the privacy is a went to the 21st century, and that's not old, and that's not old.
When you go home, you're going to go to your eye, just because the companies and state the possibility, the possibility of information, they don't have to specifically.
And if you don't believe you, you ask your telephants to the information that they've talk about you about you.
So, in the future, every time you're going to use your handy, you remember your handy, you're going to remember the self-bestimate time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoids, snellrestaurants, books.
So the city of the city, and so that the names, and over the Names South Central Central Central, and it's a little bit of the South Los Angeles, which is something that's going to change what's going on on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituoes, snell, snellrestaurants, books.
So like 265 million other Americans I live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the central Los Angeles, and the Drive-byear-by-byear-byear-byear-byear-bys.

People are south Central Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The father is in my father in my fourth is quarter than about five males, and five males, the circa, the circa,
I couldn't go to the more withans.
And I asked me how you feel like you would feel like you'd have a curious food, if you could have a lot of the house when you look at the house that new expectations that's the best expectations that's best exploration.
I'm going to buy the rule of the wood and selling as buying as buildings.
I see Dial Dialysecialysecials like Starbucks like Starbucks.
And I'm going to stop that this is what it needs to hear.
I capture that the problem is the solution.

And then I had no lustered on 45 minutes to 45 minutes to get a pesticians to get a pesticians in presential.
So I panced a food-wald waldom.
It's a piece of land that we call Parklage.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing that's the city.
But you have to pay it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is because my responsibility, and I need to half."
And I decided to hold it into stand.
So I came and my groups that LA. Green Bounds, and we found my food, and we found my food, and operating, and even to pants, so the whole programs, so the whole programs.
We're a kind of prediction of general predicts of general stories and all of these social signs, and all of the city, and everything we're doing, and everything we do, and everything we do,
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone else.
The city came to me and he was practically a practical practice and said that I had to be a rich, and he said that I had to be a rich.
And I thought, "Come is, right?
A rich interesting antswer from foods of food on a piece of food, that's really great egal?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her's going to do this."
Because this mal wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times, Times, Steve Lopeza, and I did a story about it and talked about the story and talking about a middle of Green Rounds of Green Rounds, and we were a petition of Change, and we were recorded to change the difference.
We're going to give you in the hands.
My strategy, and he said that she said that she was different and said that they're doing what we do.
So why would they do that?
LA.
They're best 67 center.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flying to power to pants to pants.
Why didn't find the phone?
And it's a plant of a plant, you're 1,000 sames.
With the green Boha in the wall of a dollars, you're own own and community of 75 dollars.
It's my healthy, I say, I say that they should be able to build their own food.
His eating eating is like his own money is how his own money.
Look, I have a conversation in South Central.
I'm going to stop there. I've been my size there.
And I'm sure that part of this part of this, part of the reality of the other people who were fabricated by other people who were my own reality.
Look, I'm a couple of artist.
Garden is my graffiti. I'm panel my art.
Let's like a graffiti-known, the walls, I change the walls and Parklana.
I use the garden that the Earth, like a piece of piece, and the plants are my dreams for these hope for these hopes for these hopes.
They would be surprised what the Earth, everything can use it as a line as a landwand.
You can't imagine how he's a sunlume is a sun, and how people are books.
So what happened?
I've been experienced to a instrument for the first time and the result of my fourth and the result of my fourth.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the box of the box of the box.
We're the board.
They would be wonderful how kids are going to be able to be.
Garners is the therape, and the most courage, and you can do that, particularly with the city.
You know, you know, you're going to be superience.
I remember this mother, when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30, and I was small, and I came out and I came out.
I'm surely badly bad, because they were there, and I said, "Wis, you have to do that.
The Garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been decided when I saw people were so I saw and hungry, and I've been just asked me to do that. People are not going to do that, "Fin, you're not going to be afraid of you're going to be food."
And I said, "Thy teach, no, no, no angry, I don't know what they're smart.
And so it's not going to street on the street.
This is the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it back to her healthy."
At a different time I lived in this observices in this observices in Downtown LA.
These are the guy who are helped me to decided to decided.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it was powerful, and how they've been able to see her mother and her grandmother and it was great, and it was to see how it changed to see how they change it's just a moment.
Green reason is about 20 garden about 20 garden.
First of our environments worked so 50 people and they're all free and they're all free.
When kids kids, it children, it children.
When they were domata, they eat domata.
But if they don't get it involved when they don't get it, like it, like it, and the body and body, it's blind them, and whatever you're going to be blind them.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work, but they want to go in this thing -- I see -- I see the same children who are exactly on the pad, and the pad, and the next feeling them.
The Garners, I see a vision that we can training this children, where we can train their community to care their community.
And if we do that?
We could use the next building Washington Carvernment.
But if we're going to change the food of the Earth, we're going to change that we're going to do that.
So this is one of my planet. That's what I want to do.
I want to do a whole well-block on Garden, where people can share the food in the same blocks.
I want to take switch and they take them in health caf<unk>s Caf<unk>s Caf<unk>s.
So, you don't understand me.
I don't talk about costs, because I know, because it's not behavior.
The comics of news is that you have to behavior.
I talk about it, people, people working to give people, and children from the streets, and they're going to leave the streets and the eating and the eating, if you look at the own food, and when you look at the best.
So what I want to do here is this is the sexy.
I want to be that we all have ecological rebebeing, Gangster, Ganger, Ganger.
We need to record the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger.
Gangerous, you're going to be selling?
And last the waffected the choice.
When you want to do with meeting me, you don't want to do if you want to do in a couple of students and a meting and a meting, somewhere, somewhere.
When you want to do meet you want to get your sell, you're going to use your garden, so we can use any sort of pants.
From. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite switching Oxford English World English World English Worlder.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No,"
Although in 19th century, a time, a better distribution of a better distribution: "It's someone who is someone who's someone who is someone who's an astraction of pario, programs, or language, and the power of power of power.
I don't have a son of whatspracheral."
And somewhere I think about World.
But it's very important that words in the centrum of politicians, and all the politicians that they need to control.
For example, for example, third loud the British Parlament, time not the skin of the debating the debating.
And that was actually happy to the muthor of a man whole to the a manufacturing crossy, the crosby, who's the parlamental.
She was helped him in the Tower of London and talked him, but he was mutig enough enough enough enough, and he was so much enough, and he was so much until well, he was so much until that he was so much more until.
And just a few years later, we find the first nights for the first night of the first night, like Brass."
Brazy on the English word for Blech.
But that's not true. It's about a returning on a return of the present.
But to show you how Worte, how Worte and politics are, I want you to take you in the United States, as they were reconstability as they were reached.
You saw the question of how to build the question of what you should call the state of the state.
You knew it didn't know.
How do you call the leadership of a republic nation?
And that's been really long in the Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible forms.
I mean, some people wanted to call them Gouvernments, and other, others, and other, others, and other, against the other people who are recorded by the United States of America, what's the United States.
Nothing like this.
Some people want to call them beautiful conduct.
They thought that's been dangerous.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to a best for a best time.
It's how they could have work.
But everyone was incredibly unbold, because these dups, because these ducks.
I've got the day of a sense of a sense of strange, "Immer the same thing: "Immer the same thing.
The reason for the longer and the long time was that the long time was that the representanced.
The representances didn't want to do what was going to do. They didn't want to him.
Can you call it, and they're possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be bringing.
They wanted to him the most farmers, the most farmers, the most fields that they're giving them a game.
This title was "President."
President. They didn't exist. He didn't existed. But he was that someone else was that someone else was a vamermation.
This is something like the prediction of a Jury.
He hadn't have more reason than the recording "Apasser" or "Apasser" or "Apasser."
Sometimes, there were practice smaller colonial community and governments, but it was really a really unbed title.
That's why the sense of the sense.
They said, "That's longer, you can't call it President.
This cerles has to be approaches and from close and fromlands and from the citizens.
Who will take him, if he's going to take a dumbs like President of the United States?
And also after 3 weeks, the sense of the sat.
Instead of the collection, and you're not going to understand the title of the colors, but they wanted today, and they didn't know that they were not away from their own spects and civilizations for the methods and civilization, and the methods.
You can learn about three interesting things.
First -- and the first -- and I've been doing -- until now, I don't have anyone who had ever been reading the title president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title of the title. He was just about it.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something that was something that was something that was a little bit of 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important, that's the most important point, the Titel President of America" of America" of America" or not that clearly clearly?
This has been a more than 5,000 nuclears to do something that he had the biggest volcence and the greatest volcience and a full of the world and airplane.
And it's really the story, the title size of the title.
And so the sense of the end of the end of the end.
They've got a respectables.
And the other sorge of the sense of the sense of empartment -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all know how the classes, like the classrooms with the 5,000 nuclear species.
So the end of the sense of the sense, and the representances, because no one is never feelings, because never feelings, if you're going to be the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take with the most important thing I'm suggest.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality to control the reality, but actually changed the reality of the reality, the reality of the reality of the reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came in a laster with about 50 rebelligence in a laster of dalabada -- a 19-year-old, fireless, fire of Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to take my bad converse country, a pair of landal lands and regular country, and they couldn't see a rocket, and I couldn't see a regulation that I couldn't see it.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
She was long as I was written with the war, and all of the warning new pyjama-Partys and footpresentation and footpresentation with the southern and foots with ristic souths and religionalists.
But that's the opposite of self.
And so I'm going to put here, I've been working on the South Afghane, Southe Proletttes God, atheist and a radic coastic coastic coast, the last nine years, the last year, and the last years.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do things about the art, but I couldn't make a personality, but I want to make a reality of art, I want to make the personality and cars and carrying the personality and cars and recoversity and recoversity and recovers.
I want to spend a day in life in life of a drawing, the distributed to be a distributed carbon, like <unk>Popstarling and political creates and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's sonsterihad-Ganger, as a parlament to candidate and a choice and a choice with the Slogan: "What's myself! I'm talking to me!
And try to use these campaigns to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosize the nationalhels.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan on the reason, and I called "Rection" and called "Rected to the policists, and a fal controlss the streets of cars and cars on the street, but on the cars.
I want to look at me, like the conflict in Afghanistan, my mind, my minds of "modic conflict.
The war and the war and the free of approaches that are came with him, a new environment, and Mode and Mode, you can only a mothers that you can only a model for skills and self-collectional and self-corded in the fastic cell physics.
And I would like to see how a simple simple simple cabul between cabulative cards of 189999999999, and that the process of the development of the developments in their woods of the past citizens of the pastics.
But for all of these things can get in prison, they can get to be able to get mission, they can be free.
But I'm doing it because I have to slow the opposite of self-low.
This is my favorite. Which is yourself?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since a less time I worked as a model.
Second years, just said, right?
I have the feeling that now is now in the room, and I would have a uncertain space, because I wouldn't have to start this cidididemic.
I've been able to do something that I have something to do something like this.
This is the first time that someone who's the first time to see someone on the TED books, so you can see that happy to see that I think I think.
If you really have a few women really explained when I need to say that I need to say that I don't need to say that I'm going to say that I'm later.
I also asked that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very course, because I can change what you think about 10 seconds.
And that's not everyone has the chance.
These are very unfortunately, it's good that I didn't want to training them.
The most difficult part of the most part is to pullover about my head, because then you'll be able to get me out of my head, so that's nothing about my head.
In ordination.
Why do I've done this?
This was a person.
Now, it wasn't hopefully like this picture.
One of the power is, but a surface, it's also a surface.
I've just a little bit of my own minds in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never really never been a friend.
I feel very unhapped me, and the photography, I'm solve my hands and with my hand in the hand in the half of this types.
And then, from Operations or the false of operations, I'm going to do two days ago, there are two days of working for the works of our own opportunities, and our own own own operation -- even though, even though, and our own lives influence -- and our lives.
To being to be hoth to be able to be able to be.
And I'm standing on this book because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this book because I'm house, because I know, and in my branch, and in my branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people who are always standing the real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh," but that means, but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model that's a building in the genetic lottery and maybe you're really important experience, and maybe this experience.
Now, in the last few century, we have been beauty and yet, we don't just as healthymetrically defined, we're used to be biological programs, but also hospital, but also hospital and hospital.
This is a supposed to me. And it's a superccess.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe even a few maybe a few maybe a few mothers, "Halti, Tyra. Johns. Johns. Luiui.
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to be a teacher.
But I've got to tell you that in 2007, a very at the year, a very at the 2007, the NYU all the models on the last year, every time, every single time, and that was booked by 2767, and that was only about 2767 mels or two percent of the produced.
The next question that I always been told me, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm going to grow up?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know what I don't know, that's not in my consation."
But the second answer that I want to really want to be small girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all be.
You can be president in the U.S. or the U.S. or the next Internet or a ninjurga-Herchirg-Dichinterina, which is irregal, because then you know, the first time you're going to be the first."
When they say, if they're still saying, "No, no, no, no, Cameron, I want to say, "What's saying, "What's my cameron."
Because I don't have a responsibility for the chefredit of the American vogue or the American vogue or the next mels of Hamp; the next survivalis.
To say that you're going to be a model that you want to say that you're going to say that you're going to be the Jackpotto the lotto.
You can't power it and it's almostic and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I've been able to do that, because the other than highly different than the other than hands.
If you're going to be a photograph, and that's just like a nice, and the cours, and the cameron, and the cameron, and then you want to go to the long, and then you go to the box, and then you go to the poor, and this poor, and this poor, and this poor, and this poor, this poor, and
It's what it looks like this.
Hopefully comic than that in the middle.
That was .... I don't know what happens.
When you're going to go and a life, and a few years, and a few Jobs, you can't be much more saying, if you say that you're going to be a lot of the United States, but in life, in life, "10 years," and then you'll go to the United States, you get come up.
The next question that I'm sured me, "What's all the photos?"
And yes, so pretty all the photos will be retired, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is all the first photo, and that's what I did, and that was also the most of the most mal, and I had a biciniode. I hadn't even my piode.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young mice.
So I saw a few months took my grandmother.
This is what I'm at the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is what I'm on a pyjama Party, a few days ago, a few days ago.
This is what I'm with the football sammazin.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these images are not a pictures of me.
It's constructed and it's construction of a group of profis, from Haveylists and metchups and pictures and pictures and stylists and the stylists and the non-production.
Okay, askay, when people wondering me, "Crossonst you're going to be surprising?"
Yes, I have too many 20-cm-Abs, I can never metime I can never be able to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to be in real life, and we're not talking about it.
I'm in Cambridge and a day, and one day I went into a laden and I had my money, and you had my money for me.
When I went to my friends with my friends with a food food food, and they were talking about a redled a redlection, and of course, we needed a serious, and we could only have a power, and we could further.
I have this costs of things that I've got to go and not know, and not because of my personality and there are people who are people who are not a personality and not knowing their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and I filmed, 85 percent of the latinos and most of the latinos and most of the men.
It's live in New York only 17,000 young, men and Latinos, and Latinos, "What's not the question?"
So, "How often I'm going to go to the wall? When I'm going to look at?
And I found my researchers for those talks about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers are not going to 78 percent of them.
The last question is, "How is it, "How is it, it's a model?"
And I think they're expecting these answers: "When you're going to be a little bit of harm, and then you feel like you feel very happy and fabulous and fabela."
And Backage we're going to give you a answer that maybe this eind.
We say, "It's really great, so much to talk about creative, and it's greative, inspiring people, living inspiring people."
And everything that's true, but it's just the story that we never never never before the camera, which I never never say, "I've never seen before the camera."
And I feel like to see me because I have to think every day about my exception.
And if you ask yourself, "What would be happy if I be happy when I was going to believe you and believe?"
Then you should have a few models, because they've got the thinst broke the most important benefits and the coolest cools and they're the coolest cools, and they're the most women on the planet.
When I didn't have this talked about this talk, he was very difficult to me very difficult to quite a real bilances, because I felt very uncomfortunately, and I'm very until I'm going to say, "I'm going to believe myself." And I'd like told me.
It was very difficult, a very difficult, a supply, and returned out of the biggest and representing a bigger nutrients.
But I'm also happy and felt like this, and I've been here, and I've been able to help it here, and I've been here, or 20 or 30 or 30 or 30 or 30 years, and my career, and I wouldn't get my career, I wouldn't really care about my career.
When you take a little bit of something with something that we're allowed to be able to recognize the power of the power and following the power of the power.
Thank you.
I've never been the words of my grandmother, which is never been able to embradafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Walldafi Worldafi Worldafi Worldafi.
But who never never been like a gaddafi-Revolution."
It's almost two years, since the since of the since of revolution of the wave of the wave of the wave of the massive of the oldests, as in the oldesty revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, and I spent up within a lot of liby, took a day of the corn and to start a revolution of the tyrannyranna Gadaffic Regime Gadaffis.
And there was a big revolution.
Now, the by women and men and men and men in the first rihea, for the end of the rule of the rule of the rivers, and social general community, and social general community.
They've got to give muthaful mutes by by by by brutal Diatur Gaddafishing.
They have a strong sense of sense, farity, from the most farmers, until the farmers, until the south.
And finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 toted to start to start our country and the Tyranians and the Tyranians and the Tyran.
Gaddafi, every big big big big big big big business, the tyranni, the corruption and the reason for currently.
And over the four year, Gaddafis, Gaddafis, the infrastructure, the infrastructure, as the culture of the lybical structure of the lybical society.
The consciousness and the challenge and the challenge, I as many other women, I as many other women who areased on the civil society and we're reports of distributed and national discocracy and national equational.
And so on 200 organizations were during and about 200 organizations, and in Benghazi, falling in Benghazi.
After 33 years in Exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasm, I started to the top of the Themenazing capacity, human education, human education and leaders.
With a wonderful group of women, I women, I women, and I women, a movement of women, a movement of women, and the fire life of women, the creatures of women's solution for the stopolitical stops.
And I'm switching on a very difficult environment, a very difficult environment, a polarised. One of the egoistic politics of Dominan politics and explained by Dominan.
I lived a initiative of the Freezer and women, and I women to reach avoid of women, a law, a law, a law, each biological citizens, and to feel the rights and possible for all the rights and polics.
At the end of our initiative and recorded to the initiative.
Women women 175 percent of the National Congresses in the first national choice for 52 years.
But long, but the eye, everyone else of the elephories and the entire revolution to <unk>n't growing up to news.
One morning, we're looking at the money of the money, and suggests and Si-Gral Mox.
One of another morning, we're going to be the morning of American bothers and the angripts.
And again, again, the extraordinary of opening the arms of open.
And really, we really expect every day we're looking at the milize and their own sets and their own villages and their own power and their power and their missions.
Our society, business, a revolutionary opportunity, polarised and polarized by the ideal and Principle, and Principle Galendence, social Gereks.
Intolerances, evolution, and Rache and Rachevolution of the evolution of the revolution.
I'm not today today with the success of the success of our reversation of our reverse.
And I'm going to talk today today that we've been able today, and the wrong and the wrong decisions.
We've been able told our priorities.
Because the choice of writers, or significants or significants in Lybia.
Hat the researchers and the white and the white between the white and men and men and men's brought?
No, that's not.
What's it?
Why will our society is going to polarized and dominated by self-shinancial politics and the explane, slowly as women?
Maybe the women't the only thing that has not the only way that the white of the female of the women's the female of the middle of the middle of the skills.
Our society needs a national Dialogue and considerational and considered the number of the number of the end of the end of the polarization and decision.
Our society needs to be the qualitative considering the female of the webs of the number of the webs of the webs of the webs.
We need to stop in the names of the corning and a day of the row and a day.
We need to start to start in the names of the middle and the gnade.
We need to develop a white developing the following wrong the following walls, but also to recognade, but also together, instead of collaborates, approach, approach, a sound of consciousness.
This is the ideal that are the ideal that a visit of war, and that's brother to reach free to free peace.
Because the Fried has a alchemy and in this alchemics, and in this alchemines and maskins and masks.
This is the real reversation of years.
And we need to exist increasing, before we need to do it sociopolitically.
After a visual called "Salam" -- Freeks the word "The God," "The God."
The word "rahamics," and all of the in all of the tradition, and that's got the same Arabic Wurbian Wurzel like the word "rahemics and symbolized the entire female of humanity, and the whole personality to be the whole personality of humanity.
And just like the mother's the embryo, the embryoard, completely, completely the sense of the middle of the middle of the entire existence.
That's why he said, "My Gnade Gnade, all things a little bit of things."
And so that's why he said, "My Gnade has been talking about my grand."
And so we're going to be all the guns of the gnade.
Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought, my country, and I went to the best of the world, and I went to bring the long "Nots"
And I was very stold.
In school, we're looking at the story of Kim Il-Sation, but we didn't have much about the world, and we're not very much about the world, South America, South Korea and Japanese are our fields.
When I asked myself, asked me how the eyes I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, to a little life in North All right time.
I saw years, I saw years, I saw a public head, but I thought, I thought my life in North Koreai.
My family wasn't work, and I had to live with myself.
But in 1995, my mother was a broad with a browd with the shelter of a collegin.
Darin stand: "When you're going to be here, our families are not more on this world, because we've been nothing more on this world, because weeks.
We love together on the bodies and our body are so difficult to be stervive."
I was so hard.
I heard to hear the first time that people in my country that people in my country.
I went took the bahnof, and I saw something suggest, and I saw something that I can't be more from my memory.
One live in the woman lay on the board, and a painting child in their army in their poverty in the face.
But no one half them because all of them, because all that's all that they were to care and their families.
In 1990s, there was a big hungry in North Korea.
At the end of the end of North Koreaner of the heart of the surface, and many more over the open, and many of them, because they're just because they're just a basis,
Stromousands were always been half after all the time to me all of the light, excepts, eyes of China on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side.
I always asked me, why she had been there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the rivers Amrocast <unk> <unk> <unk>11, the border between North Korea and China,
How do you can see the flow of flows, and it's very six and he's very size.
But many sters.
Sometimes I saw people in the flower.
I can't say much about how I can't slowly to say that I can say that I can say that I'd say that I was during the hunger of chinairs of chinaws.
I thought I thought I was a course of my family of my family.
I would have never been doing that it was 14 years together together together.
In China was very hard to live as young meters without family.
I had no idea of how life as the life as neurordan, as neurons as next to be extremely, but I wouldn't just extremely extremely difficult, but also, it's also a very dangerous fish.
So I lived in strange that my windows me to fly, and you could fly in a bit of sentence, and you would have been looking back to North Korea.
One day, my biggest alptraum, when I was true from Chinese police and in the Chinese police and in the police and in the police.
And someone else, North Koreanina, so they did my chinese chinese skills and I'm surely women.
I had solided to be afraid of my heart would explodate.
Which is something that I could be innaturally, I could be able to be able to each other.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I'm sent to control my life, and I'm sort of questions.
And after them with the exception, he said, "That was a false, "This was a false.
It's not a North Korean."
And they love me. It was a wonder.
Some North Koreaner's looking at China in China in China, but many of Chinese police, and many of Chinese police and absolutely.
This girls had great great great great great girl.
Although they were expected, they were finally finally free-down international pressure international prints international pressure.
This North Koreanerins didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, until the north Korean in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be able to be history or opened or public.
Although I had to my flight, I had a lot of other northern North Koreanorean, not so.
It's tragic that North Korean, their identity and hard to survival and hard to survival.
And after she went to a new language and worked on a moment in a moment on a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the most decided to South Korea, and I've been recording to South A new life.
Mich in South Korea, no one was a greater challenge, a greater challenge, as I thought it was done.
English was in South Korea so important that I had to learn to learning my third language.
And I've been the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all core, but we've been very common inside ourselves, we've been very completely from 67 years of the part of 67 years of the part of the part of 67 years.
I'm fly a identity.
Bin I'm South or North Koreanina?
Where I'm come from? Who I am?
Plike, there was no land more, that my home, that my home.
Although I was the anpassion of the southern life, I had no light, I had a plan.
I'm going to represent me to the university of the university.
Gerade as I was going to be able to be able to get a bit of my life.
The north Korean body, the money, the money, and when I was my family, and when streets, and when streets to a family between place.
They had to fly as possible, so I started to plan her flies.
North Koreaner, a unbelievable streets on their way.
It's almost impossible tools between North Asa and Southerna, Ironically to China and I was after China and made me back to China and I was took the northern Coreanian Grench.
Because my family, I had to live them, I had to live them more than 2,000 miles through China and then after South Adasia.
The business is a week, and weeks, and we were more fastic.
One time, when the business was a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the evidence of all, and he started questions.
And my family doesn't get a chinese, I thought I thought she would be family.
When the Chinese example, my family, I decided took them and said that she was dreams, and I was since its own person.
He looked at me, but he looked at me, but happy, I think he was happy.
We've got to read it to the laotic garren, but I had took all my money to broken the boundaries of Laos.
But even after we had the boundaries about the boundaries, my family inhavior, illegal garrency.
And then I had money and shoots and shoot my family, my family inside of a months of a months, but my family, my family, in the city of Losa.
This was one of the greatest running my life.
I had all done to family to family to family, and we were so nearly nearly family, but my family, just my family both of the Southorean Botan Bothore.
I went back and I went to the increasing and the police and the police and trying to police, my family, but I hadn't enough money or money or money or Geldeldel or Geldeldeld or money.
I'm slorry.
And then I asked me the voice of a man, "What's los?"
I was found that I was surprised that a friend of it.
In fact, in English and with a wordship and I was recognization and without a bank, and without a bank, and number of the money and two norths for my family and two norths to get them out of the opposite.
I thank you very much about him, and I asked him, "Why help me?"
"I'm not help you," he was.
"I help the north Korean people."
Mird was that this is a symbolic moment in my life.
The revorced frembolismbolised for me to a new hope for me to a new hope, and he showed me the North Korean, and he showed me the friends and the free of free and the companies as the freedoms of the Northern Cordinational economy.
And finally, after our long risks, my family and I recorded to replain the freeks, but the freeks.
Many North Koreaner will be done by their families, and soon as they're in a new country, they're not going to start with a new country or no money.
The international community can help us help us to help us to help us, the education and many more.
We can also be the breast can be between the people in North Korea and the eye, because many of us have still in contact with families, and we're going to change them information and generation, and we're going to change the money.
I had a happiness, so much hope and inspiration inspiration inspiration inspiration of northern North Korean North Korean, with international companies.
I'm sure you're a lot more successful North Korean North Korean, also see on the world, also on the board of TED.
Thank you very much.
I've just a bit of a bit.
I don't say you're not saying that I'm not normal.
I want to tell you my breaking my breaks.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't talk about, but he's communicated free, like a kind of the best red of the best red.
Remi, what love is love.
He's particularly teaching and he's expensive.
He's not just a real. He doesn't look at the skin.
He doesn't care about religious difference and imagine, and you're not only one light: He's never been a light.
When he looked at our childhood, it's trying to still the words that I remember that I remember a thing: how would we know about the consider that we need to know about the uncertainly, and how wonderful.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He's a absolutely uncomfortable general.
But he's also a six.
He can't remember, whether he's my shocolate, but he remember that he remembers of every single long on my iPod, he was fourth, the first lower, as he was fouring on my policy, and the first policype of my polics.
Don't you're not incredibly?
But many people don't stimate.
And in fact, because their constantly not in the society of normal pas, they're often about the past and false.
But what my hearts and my soul and my selection was that, whether this was that the case was that the case wasn't even a bit of case, that was a bit of a bit of authorious, and it was authoric and evidence.
Now, for theject of you who don't use the process of you who are not socialism, it's a complex function of the brain, the brain of the brain, the social communication, and you can see the longer and sometimes the large.
It's like every individual in every individual, it's space, as a sample of sample.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person Autism, and whether it's a little bit of the most fastest evolution of the world, there's no recognization or home.
And I can't remember the first time when I remember autism, but I can't remember, but I can't remember it.
I was just three years old, when my brother as my brother, and I was so on my life, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months was that he was different.
He wrote a lot of.
He didn't want to play how it did the other babies, and actually, and actually not very interested in myself.
Remi, and regulated in his own world, with his own world, with his own rules, and he founds like a little bit of things like autos in a small cars in a series in a series of what it's state and what it's studying it.
And when he was older, he was different and the difference, and the difference.
But the woods and the wood and the frust and the frust and the neverage of hyperactivity was something really a really single thing: a reinfully natures, a junk of the world, a junky, a human, a human being.
And then, in fact,
Now, I can't live that there was some of the only ways of family moments in my family, moments I wished to me that they were exactly how I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like.
But I'm going to go back to the thoughts that they've been talking about Individuality, communication, communication and love that this is that these things I don't want to tell you that this is not going to challenge.
Normality about the beauty that beauty that we're going to give us, and the fact that we're not that we're not that one of us are not that one of us.
It means that there's another kind of rather than responsible.
And if I just a thing to say, and I could say to sam and to sam and then you wouldn't be normal.
You're going to be similar.
Because, Autistic or not, the difference that we have a story that we have a story! Everybody's a story, and in all the streets of us, the ultimate opening opening opened by potential.
The chance on the size, fears, and the wall and walls in the moment, like someone else, like someone else.
Bitch -- you're not saying that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Docccracted us with edge and neuriously, and neuriously, with this photo on the project, and with a project of a million second of a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, we're not going to see the world or a million or a million or a million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion.
I'm going to tell you a new kind of photography, the photography, a new education that it's so fastics that they can make time, that they can make time in movement in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the absolutely to build each other or without the ecks or without a beautiful in our body, and really in our body, and really in our body, what we can do with "Camera"
If I'm going to take a laser and him in a million south of seconds -- that's more female -- that's more female -- that's a packet of Paketon, and this is a billion potential and this project is going to be a milotoneth.
So if you take this project, this potones, this potones and it in this potones, how these potones are going to breaking this photones in the fly?
How does it looks like this?
So this whole events --
So think about it, thinking about it, the whole events are actually less than a nanosecond than a nanosecond -- so light to get this streets -- but I'm going to see this video to 10 billion dollars, but I can see that you can see the factor of the factor.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financialized.
So, in this film is very much, so let me show you what happens to show you what happens.
The puls, our project, our project, transpaking a potonpaketon, a pacet, and that's starting to move and that's breaking in the break.
A part of the light, after the light, and you see this extreme of the waves.
Many of the photones are reaching the last last last last last, and exploding the rivers.
How do you can see, there's air, which is airl of flash on the flash.
Whiled to the waves are reflecting on the table and while the reflexions of the reflexions of the end of the focuss on the end of the focuss.
If you take a piece of project, and this same pully and that's the same streets and the video, and the video, you know, how long you're going to see how long you've got to see here?
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long film -- from a long film -- from a long project, normal project.
And how do it looks like a still billion?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like if you're a teaching in a teach.
I'm going to be as if the nature as a photo mal, the nature, yeahils a femberto bottom, but of course, of course, of course.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the lights the lights on the light, that's not going to be done.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and that's the light and the light and after a few seconds.
So, in future when these future, if this femto-Kamera in your camera, it could be possible, it could be able to make a sense of a surgery, no free, no running a fraction.
So how did my teamera, this camera?
So as photographs know if you're a photo with course, you've got very little light, but we've got a billion light, but we've got a billion times as your citizens as your citizens, so good as you can't get a good light.
So we're doing this: We're going to do this project, this potones, and showing this pacet, and showing this pack and repeating and repeating this generation and this generation of data, we've been recording to record this fish fish fragile.
And we can take all these roohdates, and we're really interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can make us important, but how would it with a new surgery for a new surgery for a coverage: to see eckets:
The idea is that we're going to street on the door.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it will be back to the door, and then reflecting back to the camera and we could return back to the more simployees of the light.
And that's not a science. We've built. We've built.
Link of our femto-Kamera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we'll be able to read the door.
After our abhandard in the "Nature Communication" was published by nature.communication.communication.coming these animation.
We're going to get this light, and they're going to get to the wall and they're going to get in all the potones, and they're going to be in all the potones and some of the potones, and then the potential pully, and then the light, and then the trees.
And because we have a camera, the so fast -- our femto-Kamera has a few few feelings.
It's a very good time, and she can look at the world, and they can look at the world.
And then we know, of course, we know, but also the door, but also the most objects, but we don't know what we don't know what the points of the point.
So what we can see a laser on the laser, we can see a rooh-born, how they see on the screen -- not really sense of these image, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they try together and try together, and they're trying together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit often, we can see the laboratory, we can use the practice, we could build autoscially, and we can see what's going to see what's going to be able to read the curve, or we can look at the lights, or we're going to looking for the lights.
But because of the blood and building and building is very, very, very, very, very hard to scientists, which is a while, now, now, now, now, now, now a new picture of picture of the next picture of the next generation of the next generation of the next generation of medicine.
So, like this, we can't have a scientist, even a scientist, and we can't have a certain science, a certainment of the ultra-braphy, and I wasn't just a collabyton, and everything we don't know every time we don't know every time that we don't know everything.
But it's also happening here.
When you look at this waves of rivers, you see that the wave you see that the waves of us.
The waves should be able to move.
What happens?
It turns out that we've been able to take in Light, because we've been able to take a public effects and astein's an incredibly walking this image.
The records, in the events in the world, in the world, he's happen in the world in the camera in the camera, so you can relationships by space and time you can create these constraction of space, we can create these constraction.
So, whether we should be able to focus on the education of a new data, and we've got to reduce the medical or new data, we all have data, and we all have datails and datails on our ways.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many opportunities like our lives.
We don't do any night in the street, so many ways, so many ways, so many ways, we're going to use this same public public public public planets.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and how things like Aclebers and create things like aircle, shablones and circles.
The projects from my questions, how much memory, how much member my neighbors?
How can we live more things without us to stop more things?
How can we share our expensions of the memory and the lands and the country and the country?
And how can we share our hope for living our houses, so our community, our community and trees our beds and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My selection is going to be huge of the right embrahightens, the since, beds and trees, and trees language, I'm always language, and I'm always stady in the music.
I think every time, every time you're never ever never been in New Orleans a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city with most of the city in America.
I'm going to be able to do this house and I've been beautiful, and I thought I could change my life for a little bit of my life for always changed.
In 2009, I'm someone who I loved very loved.
You're Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your Tod came to me.
I've been talking about the death, and I've been a big disease for my life, and I needed to believe me in life, and I need to be in life.
But it's hard to me, this sort of evidence every day.
It's easy to understand what's really important to understand what really important.
With the help of older and new friends and new friends of the side of the house of the house, and I wrote with a side of slone, "Bevailable, I want to be a both of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of piece of the piece of the piece
I wasn't sure what I could experiment to the experiment, but I could get the next day, but the walls completely completely and they're always getting up.
I want to share some sense of you who were shared to the walls that were written.
"Bevor I want to ster, I want to be piratterns."
"Bevor, I want to ster, I want to stand about the International Datums."
"Bevor I want to sing, I want to sing for millions."
"Bevor I want to ster, I want to pant."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netheless."
"Bevor I want to look at them, I want them to be in my arms."
"Bevor I want to be a little bit of cavallery."
"Bevor I want to be stervor, I want to be myself."
This is after place to a sense of place, and the hope, and the hope and the hope and trees me to the laughters and translated me to the wine and translated my time.
It's about to know that you're not all yourself.
It's about it, our neighborhood and second and second and on a new and way.
It's about it, please, and to remembers and to remember what we're going to remember what we growth and change ourselves.
I've been doing this last year, and I've been hundreds of living in the last year, and I wanted to build a walls and I wanted to build a bask and I've got a bask and now have been in the world, and now in the world, and now in the world,
We've been used to have our powerful public public public public public voice and more with other people.
Two of the most of the most things that we've been time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever before the things with the right blick blicks and think that life is that life, and that life is that life is that life is currently.
We're going to talk about it, we're going to talk about the death or just to think about it, but I've just recognition to the death of the death is one of the death is the most strong.
The thought about the death of the death of us.
Our common population shows what we can do is to help us what we can do as individual and more important. And with more important and more impossibilities, and our hope to share our hope to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me with me with an empathematics. A particular problem for everyone who are considered to each other, is that we're going to be like companies.
Nobody knows what we do is really doing.
So I'm going to talk today today, I'm going to tell you what I do.
Tances is one of the most human activities.
We're decided to be approach from most of most of most ballettle and sentence, like you see how you see.
For ballettle, a very extraordinary markets and ability and abilities, and possibility, and possible eventually, and possible eventually have a genetic completely.
Traigerately, the first stories like Parkinson, like Parkinson's longer in the skills. That's what makes my parks. That's what I was a ballettuit of the time.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the mind.
Trotime, there's been a world to 63 million people who live in this disease, and they need to live with the unbelievable symptoms like symptoms, smptoms, and more living more living in the disease, and more living disease.
We need to know if we can use the research, and last past, and last possibility, really, if we know if we've got a projective markets that question can be a question.
<unk>rigger is that there's no parkinson and other movement, you don't have a biomarker, so you can't just a biombs. This is the 20 minutes of neurogenes.
You need to be able to get it in the clinics. It's very expensive, and that means that means that never will never behavior. Nobody's never never been never.
But what if patients if patients could do this test?
That would be a bit of tour in the hospital in the hospital. What if patients, what if patients?
It wouldn't be a teacher cranks.
It costs <unk>100 percent of the neurological Abracted in neurological evolution.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods, with the method, we're trying to reach the senses, and we're all of the virtual strike, virtual strike.
Here you see a video of video of video.
This is what happens in the entire condition when someone speaks to the stimulate as a stimul ballettle, because we can see all these stimories, because we need to build all of these stimories, and we all have to build the game.
And as ballets it enormously enormous.
Think about how long a children, like a children, until it to learning.
And so we can use the position of the fibrate stimmlipping stimms. And as the gains are also the stimorganized by Parkinson's also looking at the parkinson.
And the one of the increasing of the example of unrequences for increasing voice.
We see this symptoms.
Toes, swall, Steificity.
The language will be able to live and goes on the time and that's a example of that.
This exceptions, and the voice, you can be minimal, but sometimes you can be digital microfital microfits and prison, combined with news, combinated with new laware, and we can actually create with news, and we can actually get very critical longer.
How can you look at this tests with clean message? Well, they're not avasive. The Testinvasive.
You're infrastructure. The infrastructure is there.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly, and they're not going to be the voice of experts.
So you can be able to be able to be able to be.
They're very quickly, though, three seconds.
They're very billed and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also be in great market.
This is the first stuff, we can reach it now.
We can reduce logistic switch for patients.
Patients don't have to leave in the clinics in the clinics.
We can remember whether we can relate the power.
We can just give massive massive massive for clearly and recognization and relationship of the whole population of the whole population of realization.
We've got the opportunity to look at the biomarks for the disease, before it's before it's to talk about it.
Today, we're doing the first step in this room, we started the parkinson's sunson's simple.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high-h-ships, we're going to take enough to stimulate enough to best enough this stuff.
We have space to record the divide of a billion people on this planet on this planet.
Everyone, or without phone, without parkinson, can be recording to a few center to a few center. I give you a few years, I'm going to get six percent of our center in the rights of our center.
Thank you.
When you say, if you're 10,000 people call 10,000 people, you can say, who's health and who's not?
What are you doing with all these proven?
What happens is that the patients of the patients, whether this parkinson's living in parkinson't living. Okay.
Some people will not be able to create it.
But we sample, we're looking at different data, different environments, which is interesting. This is important. This is important, because we're important to make these extraordinary parks, which are the parks of parks.
For the time, she's 86 percent of the skill?
It's much better.
My southern Thanas -- I need to love it because he's so fantastic worked on the fantastic works -- now, it's also working about the mobil function, what this projection is what this projection is that we're going to be able to build 9 percent.
That's called a connection.
This is called people -- the people can do with the handyrics and the tests and the testsones, people could do with parkinson could take their voice, so that their doctor of the disease of the disease.
Goes.
Thank you very much. Max LLLLLLooks and gentlemen!
Thank you.
Here I live in Kenia, I live in Kenia, the Nairobi-National parks.
In the hundreds of my father, and the coast, and that's the nairobi-National park.
The Nairobi-National park is in the south is just a south of the south of the south of the parks like cells like the parks of everyone.
The rule that are the solve, the solve them. And then they do this.
They kill our vieties.
This is one of our coast that was done to be done. I went to be founded on and found it was a bit of our box. It was our only bully.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, global, we think we're going together with our animals and the way that we came to our animals.
I learned to kids to eat.
Our war war war wars, you're going to use our stamm and our stamm and our hearts. They're involved on this problem.
and they killed the solution.
Here's one of six lions that were in Nairobian.
And I think there's a lot of national parks in the Nationalparks are just so lions.
In my stamm is a junny between six and new years, and new years, and next for the coast for the coast.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Feewing was Fewers. Like forch.
But then I realized that we could help us really help us to see the solve the solve the coast.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to a vogel.
I wanted to think that the solve, I thought that I was students.
But lions are very clearly clearly terms.
They're seeing the vogels and go back again. Because they're going to go and say, and say, that's not going to move, and say that's still there.
And they were taking and kill our vieties.
One night, I went to the stall. I love with a fackle in the hands, and that's not at the larger.
Like for a light, the light, that's moving.
I had a idea.
Son as a little junky junky, I was working on my room, and nearly once, and then the new Radio my mother. And I had a lot of mother. But I had a lot of electronics.
I took a old carbony and a car, and a relative of a motorrad. The left or left or left or left. He wants to be able to be able to be blind.
And I'm besting a salter to the light and out of the light.
This is a little birth of a capture of a capture.
And then I build all of it.
The solar panels that the battery, the battery, the battery strom in the right. I call it a transformation.
And the reason is less blind.
You see that the births looking at the birth, because of the solution.
And this is what it looks like this, if they come from the solution.
The light blink and the light and the solve that I think I was about the stall. It was the whole time in the bed time in the bed.
Thank you.
I have this installed installed installed and since we didn't have a problems.
And then our neighbors, our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and she was lost their animals and she asked me if I couldn't be able to fraging her light.
And I said, "Yes."
I'm installed the light. They can see the solve in the background.
Since I have them to give them houses in the neighborhood and they really work, and they really good.
My idea is now going to be in all cases, also for other rather than others like Hyave or Leoparden or Leoparden. The lights. The lights of farms.
My experience, I'm sustainable to a stip of the best schools in Kenia, Brookhouse international school, and I'm really on.
My new school engaged and hard to future and hards and hard.
I have my friends with my friends with home and I've been able to put the light, where we don't have the light, and I'm going to show you how to use them.
I just a year, I just a year of Savanne, who was the vather of the paintings. I saw myself, and I said, "I'm going to sitt in a situde!"
And here I'm going to go.
I was during with airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a big, I'm going to be airplane and pilotent. That's my great dream.
I've been going to go solve my own. But through my experience, I can talk to my vather and the solve my vather, and we can return to the side, side, without the solve, without side, without the side.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I think that means that: I thank you very much.
You know, you know, you know, how long it's a story like your story like your story.
So you've got this stips now. Yes. Yes.
You're working on other electrical experience.
What's the next to the list?
My next experience, I work, now I work on a real electrical strical strical caza?
Yes, I know, electrical cities are hard to read my own, but I want to have my own.
You've got to be a serious, not trying to try to get -- Ja, I'm trying to get back to the trying to get a slow, because I got a sleep.
Everything is hard. Richard Turere, you're something very surprised.
We're going to be done in every single way to path, my friends.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I'm since I'm a camera in the hand, is photography my passion. But my passion. But I want to share with you 15 my favorite, and no one of them.
There was no kind of director, no stilists, no chance, no chance, no chance, no light. Not even a picture.
In fact, most of the most of them were remained by the tourists were tourists.
My story begins as I started a talking about a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, on my first building on my poorest building on my arm. We were at 57th of 57, and 57th of 57 and 57th.
And so we were a year later, we were repected and so we decided to same the same picture.
Now, you can see that, you can see that.
When the third building my daughter, my wife said, "Hey, why, why don't you bring to New York and makes it a father to New York and do it?
And then we started to make selling days against animals to make a picture of us.
You know, it's noticed, like universe is the face of the face is when you're talking about a visual free.
Nobody has ever seemed to be a little bit and too lucky, someone has never been done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rises would change our lives.
This is very hard today is very hard today.
