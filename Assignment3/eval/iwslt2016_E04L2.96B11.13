When I was 11 years old, I was a morning a morning the clines.
My father hearing on his little bit, gray, the news, the news.
He looked very happy, what happy, which was pretty amazing, because the news, most of the news.
He said, "The Taliban are female.
I didn't know what that means that means, but it made meant, but it made very happy.
"Just, you can go on a real school," he said," he said.
I'm going to use the morning.
Actually, a real school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and spent a girls, and they spend to school.
So I was skilled myself, I five years, and I started my older, my older sister, I didn't get anymore, to apart to a secret.
Only, we could go to school,
Every day, we couldn't get a different way, so that we couldn't get anyone.
We'd hide our books in the efforts of selling it as a bunch of it.
And we were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a little women.
In the winter was awful, but in the summer, but in the summer.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the unless of the unress of the unress of a weeks, because the taliban power.
We were never safe, how much they knew how much they knew.
Do they were successful?
Do you know where we're going to where we're going to?
We had afraid, but we wanted to school,
I had a big happiness in a family to grow up in the matter, and taken and taken.
My grandfather was being ahead.
As a very extraction of a decide provinced province Afghanistan -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- my father -- to be dad.
My found mother, but it was teachers, teachers.
It's what they do.
Two years ago, she went to the rhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this was the first thing -- the first in his family, who was a schoolboard.
For him, it was sound that his children, it would be a children, even a children, even though, even though, taliban, taliban, taliban,
He looked like a lot larger risk of children, his children don't go to school.
I know that I'm going to be in the Taliban sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective,
I was good luster, I had to give me after he said, "Taughter," and you can hear.
And your money can be done. You can be done in war. You can be done in war.
But a thing is always getting you always getting here, and even if we're going to be able to children, we'll have to do that.
So -- still you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, which is destroyed by decades.
Less than 6 percent of my age of my age of my age of my age of age of seconds, and if my family, and if my family, I would have a slowerfulborhood, I would have a women.
Instead of standing here today, as strong as strange as a strange of the Middlebury College.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was returned by his family, because he was sended to school because he's got to school, a killed to school, one of the first thing that gatulatulated.
He doesn't just small high school, but also, but also that I was also the first woman who was the first woman who was the first woman who was fully.
My family believe me.
I have a big dreamily, but my family has greater trees for me.
So I'm global bothers, a global bothers, a global campaign for 10x10 campaign.
So I've been able to green, SOLA, and maybe a few Internative internative in Afghanistan, a land, a land, a land, a land,
It's wonderful to see how the snowled with great ears with great ears with great ears.
And to see how their parents and vice and vice, like my parents, as my parents, and I decided to make all the time.
So as Ahmed. That's not really affordable, but I can't show his face, but Ahmed, but after my snowled.
And I've been a month, and heimbing on the home, and heimwed on the dorning and they're going through a bombing on the streets.
When he got home, came back to the phone and a stimming the telephone, and a stimming his daughter, they'd behind the school.
And he said, "Theads me, but I'm not going to do, but I'm not going to play my daughters on top of my daughter, and more and more and more and talk about it."
What Afghanistan, I've got something like this, I realized something that's going to be able to be able to be the most success, most of us who have a father who have a father who is going to be a daughter.
It's not successful role in our mothers in our successful role.
These are the most powerful, they're going to start to talk about a lot of convince a lot of their taking future of their taking a society like the future of their daughanistan is the uncomfortable.
And the Taliban went to the taliban girls -- because it was some girls -- because it was ever illegal.
But today, everybody in Afghanistanianistances of girls.
Afghanistan, from America from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how we change.
I'm not going to change the change of determinate, and they're not changed all the United States.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I'm going to students in my school, and their parents that they're going to make a lot of parents that they're going to make a lot of parents, I see a lot of future and a longer.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope and the uncomfortunities, and the possibilities, and that girls that suns.
And as I think they have great trees.
Thank you.
Everything I do, even more -- my life -- my life -- my life -- my life -- my life in Africa as young man.
In 1971 to 1977 -- I'm looking at the <unk> I'm not -- I'm in Sambia, Kenya, coast, algories and Somalia, algories and summerican countries.
I've been working for a single project, and every single project, and every single project that we'd standing.
I was a broken.
I thought, two years, we thought we're going to be good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we found everything we're going to do.
Our first project, what my first project, "Ripples to the book called "Ripples," inspiring, where we wanted to show people how to show people how nutritional food.
We came up with analyzed in South Asia, in South America, in this to the Sambia, which leads to the sambia, and we lived the sky. We lived in the tomata and tomata and Zucinci.
Of course, the answer to the answer to the interests, so we didn't have any interesting them to work for the work, and sometimes they're also going too.
We were only in a sense that it was in a so early not so economy.
But instead of how they asked why they didn't say, "God, we just said, "God, we're here!"
"Gerade, you're right now to relationship to save the sambiased."
Of course, all of it wonderful in Africa.
We had this practices, they were so big, they were so big, they were so big, so big,
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Shead, like, "Sook, like skin, like simple landwirt.
When the tomata and red, came acrosssss of nights from the footprint of the river.
We said to the sambed, "Oh God, God, the nilport.
And they said, "Yes, we have no country, we have no country."
"Why didn't say, "It you know, "I'm never asked us."
I thought we were just, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw, but then I watched what the Americans did, what the English, what the focused on what they did.
We filled to least the nilport.
They should see the uncomfortable -- you should see the university we don't have to see the United States.
They should be the book, "Tead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambian economists.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have a change the African continent 1.5 trillion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money.
Les you just want to book.
Lesen you from a Africans have an Africans have a story.
We western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionary and there are only two species, and we're patriarchalical. We're patriarchalical.
Both woman who are striction of latines," which means "Father" means "Father"
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalical: I'm not a different culture, as if they were my children. "I love my children.
Patronized: I'm not patronizing everyone else, as if they were my dying my dying my dying my dying my dying my distress.
And so why people are going to be known as Africa, Chef, Chef, Chef,
I was growing up when I was the book, "Small," by small smaller," and he said, "The Go. He said, if people don't want to help people, then they don't want to go into Rwitch.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is Respect.
Today, the morning the heart of the conference that created a stab on the ground, and asked, "King yourself, you're not neocolonial?"
When I was a 27 years old, I decided to react on people who have a system, and he never might be a system where never heard something initiating initiating, but you never get to the distribution, but you're going to be the distribution of the pion of the diction of the diction of the pion of the
What you do -- you're going to be the mouth.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're situation with the sky.
We don't work from Brosss.
We make us in Caf<unk>s. We make us in Cneips.
We have no infrastructure.
We fly fly finally find out what the person, what the person.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can someone a sense of idea.
If those person doesn't like this?
The passion for the personal growth of person is the most important thing.
The passion for the passion is the most important thing is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the science, because no one can be a completely.
The person with the idea has not the idea, but it's not available.
A lot of years ago, why didn't state, why, and I'd saying, why they're not supposed to say why do not in community? But not to hear it in community? But not in community.
Let me give you a secrets.
There's a problem with community.
Internal companies have never shared, and they're never going to say what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they're seeing.
Planation has this blind flew flow.
The most people who are not the community, you know, because they never methods, because they never seem to be able to do.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, social infrastructure that don't existed.
A new board to be created.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedroad, who's in the house, and in your caf?"
I have this in it in its in its in it.
I was promoved to the time and trying to find out what they're going to do, where we should do.
And so I was going to help us to help used to help me and half of my first customers, and I'd him. He was half. He was a garage, he was a garage, and I was him. I'd him. I'd get to organizing a restaurant.
I'm going to work with fish fish, and they're not going to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to give them a footprint for selling us to Japan for Sushi for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I hold the mouth and highly high."
So -- -- so -- so the government: "Make it again."
We've done it in 300 general in 300 general.
We have 40,000 companies on the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are companies that are insurance.
Peter printer, one of the best companies, after the story, story, a few years ago.
Peter printer was Philosophyprofessor, before he was businessor,
Planation is the deathescussion of the entrepreneurs.
So you built a christmas, without know what the most cool human coast human cocking their money and their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get this.
You have to give them a privacy and privacy and privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them, and they'll get them.
In a community of 10,000 people getting 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are imagine and the intelligence and the passion?
For example, what presentation, you've been in the most morning?
<unk>rative, emotional human being applications.
I want to say that companies saying that companies.
We're on the first industrial revolution -- nicherbare fossil fossil fossil fossil fuel, fully, and systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are systems that are systems that are not system
The connection of powerful.
The Freon-Aron-Aron't behavior.
We have to look at the seven billion people, we have to look at seven billion people, careful ways of transports, transportation and correspond to them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who's going to be the green revolution? Universities? Our universities?
The government? Because you're going to eat it!
It's going to be companies. And they're going to do it.
I'm going to be a food story in a foodistic magazine a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were in the future of the future of New York town New York in 1860.
In 1860 came together and speculated and speculated in 100 years, which was happened in 100 years. The New York. The city. The city. The New York City.
Why? You saw the course of course, and said, if the population in this tempo, they needed to be six million population, and they were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be figured.
Because they went to the master.
1860, they see the worst technology that's lives from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001 cars in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of technology to find a different technology, the running. It was a little fabrics in the back in the back in the back.
Dember, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secrets to work with companies.
When he had to be discer,
They didn't come to talk to you.
So when you have to give them approached, engaged and empowerful service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the universe.
From the little biggest firma have to be all in the largest free things, three things.
Rata?
We never met a few person who can make a same time, and we've been able to sell the same time and make the money.
It doesn't exist.
These person had never born.
We've seen a research and we looked at the world's the most companies -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford the new companies, Google, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoo.
There's just a thing that allows allowed all the world, just a companies of the world, just a person who was just a person who was just a person.
Now, we're going to leading 16-year-year-year-olding companies like the first two side of Richard Branson Autobiography of Richard Branson Autobiography. The first two-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-olds of the first side
No one time," and 32 times "wir."
He wasn't alone, when he started.
Nobody's green a company. No one found.
So we can make a community, you can tell you, who have a little bit of the interesting memory, in Caf<unk>s and Bars and Bars and Bars.
What can you do? Can you can imagine?
Okay, you can buy it? Can you can record your money?
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Maybe you're not going to be someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have a groups of free volunteers, and we're going to help them to help them to help them to help them to help people, and we've found that the wonderful population of the intelligence of the intelligence.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I have to be like it, alice, Alice, Alice in wonderful.
The penn State University, a draw me -- a dotication -- a distribute instantly in the communications.
I had anxiety --
Right? At first. Angle students with their great brains and their great big big big big big big big big big big big big,
But as the conversation, he was developed, as Alice, as Alice, as Alice, as they looked at the cannins and a cannin to a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I was felting my face, I was able to students. I was just wanted to be able to discovered that other wonderful that other wonderful.
I think that taking this door to open it, it's great communication.
We need independently big communications of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers and energy that our largest problems, like the energy, like energy, and when we don't understanding, and if we don't understand it. I think it's not going to believe that it's not going to believe that it's not going to believe that it.
But these great conversation is not to come together, if our scientists and engineers and engineering our wonderful.
So scientists and engineers and engineers, clearly.
I want to show you a few answer to show you how to see how to see that we can see that we can see that the technology and technology and technology and technology and talking to you.
The first question that you have to answer us to us?
Say, why well, why well, scientific are so relevant for us.
Say not just that their dragings, but they're looking at us, but also tells us that their terrible structure in our cooking structure in our cooking, because they can understanding own cooking and understanding own corose and understanding.
And if you're going to be what you do, then you get the words.
First of all the winds are a circle to understanding.
Surely, you might be transformed and pretty and pretty simple quite, but why don't just understand what much of time, and time, what much of us?
Our Ged ideas of course, it's not the same as their nive as their nive.
As an amazing said, "Maching things like this, but not just as possible -- but not just as possible.
You can tell us something about your eyes, you know, scientific visual areas, without any conversation without compromise.
A few things are there, there's a few things: examples, stories and analogies and analogies.
And if you're going to work, then you go to the story, then the story.
Have you ever asked her, why it's "Stpoint."
What happens when someone else's going to be different? Are you going to be different, and with these points, and you're going to be audience.
A following this is not just long, but also long, but also too much language, but also the brain, and we're going to be fast, and we're going to be fast.
So this example of genes of genes of Genevieve Brown is much we're going to show you that the special structure of the tremendous stabil is that they even the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration of the event of the event.
The trick here is a single thing, simple simple sentence, and you use the audience, if it's audience, orientation, orientation, orientation, orient and graphics and graphics that are also using our other senses and definitely transforming to do is a distribute.
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these door and the wonderful and the technology and the technology and the technology and the technology in a calculate.
And there's the inner I've been different, I've been a lot of collection with the questions, I want to make me to make all same contact with a same contact with a same.
It's a science of science, and your story, and your figure out how you're going to share this public space, so that's important, and multiplicated the publicly important to their work with the people who are incredible working on it.
So scientists and engineers and engineering these same same thing, clearly unbing me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A handy can change a life, and a personal freedom.
With a handyria, you can get a syria,
With a handy can tweet a message, and a protestail, and a protesta.
And with a handy can take a song, you can take a songloud and collapse.
All of that is possible.
I'm a year, I'm live in Berlin.
Let's go back into those city in those city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people who went through the streets and the streets and the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989 and standing all of these people who had all these people who had to change the change and change a handy in the task.
Who is a handy is a handy?
Half you get it high.
Half your hand phones, you hold, you high!
Half you get it high. It's a bubberry, wow.
These are many. Fast everybody has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 35.830 ceils.
Rohdata.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006,
This is called Rightlinia is called Rightlinia.
These representation that every telephone in European society in Europe, every Internet in the entire europe, a bandwidth information.
Who's going to be a little bit of woman?
Who's a sentence?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are being for months to two years of your phone to two years of your phone society or your telephone or your Internet.
And everywhere in Europe, people who said, "That, we don't want to do."
They said, we want to do this idea of presence.
We want to be self-based in the digital time, and we don't want to be the telephone, and we want to be information about all these information about us.
There were answers, Journalists, Priester who said, "That's say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's like, well, we don't want to say, "That't want to say, "Thatch.
And here you can see how 10, thousands of people on the streets and said, "Freedom, and said, "Freedom."
And some of them said, this might be able to be able to be 2.
The stasi was the secrets in Ostruction.
And I asked me, whether that really works.
Can you really want to remember all of us?
Every time I use my handy boys?
So I asked my phone society, the dozens who were the greatest telecom, the greatest telephone in Deuter science in Deutter, and I asked her information that all information that all information that you've all information that you've talking about me.
And I asked her and asked her and asked her, and they didn't have a real big answer.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life, because it's protocols.
So I decided to make a sense of the fact that they wanted to have a sense of information, because I wanted to have this information.
But the dozenship, no, no, no, we're going to give you this information.
And at the end of the end of a confusion with them.
I'm going back to the anclude, where they're all sending me.
Because in the twice of the foundation of the minds that the involved that the emotion of the emotion of the emotion.
So I'm going to get this half of environmental environment.
And on the CD.
35.830 ceiling information.
First, I saw it, and he said to me, it's a huge datei.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this datei.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what I'm going to start with it?
Because you see where I'm going to be, where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the information with this information.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people show you what I want to show you what it means.
So with time, with time and open and open Data City.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reincoomes and out and out and out, you can go back and back.
You can make any step, you can do it, and you can do it.
And you can see how I see from Frankfurts with the stuffering the coverage of after crossss.
All of this information of this information.
It makes a little bit of anxiety.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just so, I'm going to talk to me and they're talking to you, and we talk together.
And then I'm going to go a few friends and they run a couple of friends.
And a while, you're going to go and you've got this huge communications network.
But you can see how people can see how people communicate to what they're going to go to bring away, when they go to bed.
You can see all see everything.
You know, you know, you know, you know, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you go to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have to this information, you can control the society.
This is a building countries like China and the Iran.
This is the perfect effects like you can see a society of society, because you know who's going to be a redesign, who's possible when you're going to be able to this information.
And these information are being information, for months, in Europe, in Europe.
How do I said to remember, we're going to streets in the streets in 1989 hands in 1989 hands in 1989 hands.
And the stasize of the stration, who was in the demonstration of the stration, and if the stasize of who have been going to be the leaders, then maybe that's never happened.
The case of the bliner Mauerliner Mauer maybe not statts.
And also, not the case of the case of the ice.
Because today stategentures and companies, so many information, how they want to know how they can get together, and often, and often, and often, and often.
They want to have the opportunity to have our lives, and they want to follow it allows to read it.
But self-based and a living in the digital time, not age of time.
But you have to be able to do for the self-making today.
You have to do this, you have to cold every day.
So if you go home, you're going to tell your friends that Privacy of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you're going to say your eyes, just because companies and state the companies and state the possibility, they have to do it.
And if you think about you, you're asking your phone society of information that they've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you use your handy, you remember that you have to remind you, you need to remind you.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituogenes, snaps, breastaurants, breaking breaking.
So the city planer, and so that we can make survive south Central South Central to change it to change it into south Los Angeles, as if that change in South Los Angeles,
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituogenes, skullrestaurants, books.
So like 26,5 million other Americans live in the food in the food south Central Los Angeles, the dral Los Angeles.
The comic is that the drive leads to kill more people, as the drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles.
The father than fourth of my fourth of my fourth of five mal higher than about five minute, the circaircade 15 miles.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how to feel like you'd have no stuff you're not going to have a healthy, if you'd go out of the house that if you see from the house that the best effects that are going to see the best effects of your fourth system.
I'm going to buy role and buy role and sells and sells like George.
I see the dial dialysecond data like starbucks.
And I've got to stop that the stop.
I captured the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And then, I didn't have a luster on 45 minutes to get apple to get apple to get apple to get a pesticians inpresentation.
So I plant a food food food a food.
It's a piece of land,
It's 45 to 35 feet.
The thing is the thing that's the city of city.
But you have to pollinators.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to make my responsibility, and I have to stand up in stand.
And I decided to half.
So I got my group, and my group, and I started together and we started together and we started together, and own, and own, and own, so that's all the program, so that's all the program, so that's all the program.
We're a kind of a sort of prediction, together from all of social signs of social significant and all the city, it's completely free, and everything we're going to do.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone.
The city came up and he was came up and he said to me, and he said that I had told me that I had to be a rich biggest prediction.
And I thought, "Kome, right?
A richters of foods of food from food from food from food on a piece of land, is your country, is your country, is it?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her to do this."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times, Times of it. Steve Lopezzz, and talked about it, and talking about the city and talking to a middle of Green Basically, and they were able to change.
We'd like you had the hands.
My city, and he said that they're students and said they're going to love what we do.
So why shouldn't do that?
LA.A. has in the United States, most of the state of the city of the city.
They're going to 67 collection.
These are 20 central Parks.
That's enough rivers to plants to plants to plants.
Why shouldn't find that?
And by the terms of a plants, you know,000 samples.
With breaks in the walls of a dollars, you get own value of 75 dollars.
It's my holy, I say, I say they should be able to build their own food.
His food is to building is like its own money.
You see, I have a smile, I have a south Central.
I'm going to stand there. I have my son,
And I'm sured me to be part of this, part of the reality of other people who were fabricians, and I was my own reality.
You see, I'm a artist.
Garden is my graffiti. I'm power my art.
And just like a graffiti career, who are change the walls, I think, I think, I'm a rases and Parkanles.
I use the gardeners who are using the plants, and the plants and the trees and the trees and the trees.
They would be used to do what the earthing that you can use all of it as a land.
You can't imagine how he's a sunlume is a sunlume, and how they're leaders.
So what happened?
I've been telling how my garden to a instrument for the instrument for the respection of my fourth.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the ground.
We're the ground.
They'd like children, how children are going to be affective.
Garden is the therapistic and career and careful activity, particularly, especially with the city.
And then you know, you get to war.
I remember this time, when this mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30, and they were in my garden, and I came out and I came out.
I'm really bad me feeling, because they were there, and I said, "What are you told them, you have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I was asked me when I saw people who were looking at me and hungry, and that's just asked me, and that's just asked me, "Fin, you know, you're not going to be able to stand your food."
And I said, "There's no, no, no, no, I don't know what they're doing.
And that's not to street.
It's the idea.
I want you to take it back, but I want to take her health.
For one of the other time, I was a gardens in this surround LA.
These are the guy who have helped me to decided to decide.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how they've been able to see how they have affect their grandmother and how they've been grandmother, and it was greated to see how they changed it, and it was a moment.
Green reason has been as a size of 20 garden.
For our environments, so 50 people and so 50 people and that's all freewills.
If children, if children, it's eating children.
If they're taking tomata.
But if they're nothing about it, if they get to get it, if they don't get to eating and body and body and body and body, they're blind, they're blind them.
I see people who want to work that works that works, but they're going to stand -- I see -- I see the color, and I see the path, and they're going to be able to go on the path.
The gardens, I see when I see when we can training these children, to care their communities to care their communities to lead to lead to lead after life.
And if we do that, who know who knows?
We could bring the next opportunity of Washington Carverton Carver.
But if we don't change the collection of the earth, we're going to change the never doing.
So this is one of my plane.
I want to share a whole woman who can plants, where people can share the same blocks.
I want to take schiffscontainer and they use in health caf."
So you don't understand me.
I don't talk about cost of costs, because cost of costs, because cost.
The comicated is that you have to nice that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about working people, people who are streets, and children, and they're going to be able to make the street, and the eating and the eating and if you're going to be buildings, and if you're going to buildings.
So what I want to do is to make here, this is the sixy.
I want to believe that we all ecological rebelling, Gangster, Gangster-Garden.
We have to represent the picture of gangsters.
If you don't have a gangster.
If you go to the question of selling, clear?
And let's get the waffected to be.
If you want to make meeting meeting, you don't want to make meeting me tell you, and you want to make a meeting and make a meeting, where you want to make anything about it.
If you want to make meeting, you're going to go to your sellows, so we can get some sort of sort of snowledge.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite switched oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No unprecially politicians.
Where's a century, a time, a better thousands of definition, "It's a better," is someone who's someone who's a created by parenti, unpreciated by parentially, and his following.
I have no idea what "spray," is.
Something with World, I think.
But it's very important to know that words in the center, and all the politicians that they need to control the language.
For example, for example, third, the British Parlament, not the British Parliament, the distribution.
And the fact, the mother courage to the mother mutual name of a management brass Crosby, who's crosby,
She was him in the Tower of London and talked him, but he was a good enough, he was a good enough, and he was a lot of until he was so much enough, and he was so much until you've been so much difference in London that he was so much until.
And only a few years later, we find the first news for the first news for the first newso strong as Brass" like Brass."
Brass write on the English word for Blech.
But that's not true. It's going back to a returning for a press.
But to show you how Wortech and politics, I want you to take you to the United States, I want you to take the United States, when they're just going to be the unpendence.
You saw the question about how to asking visited George Washington, which is the state of state.
You know, you didn't know.
How do you call the leaders of a republic nation?
And that was in the Congress in the Congress.
And there were all kinds of sort of possible form.
I mean, some people wanted to call him, and other sunton, and other skills, and other skills of the United States of the United States of the United States of America Washington.
Not solider.
Some people wanted to call him simple clear.
They thought that's while.
They were not even more monarchistic, they wanted to be the certain time.
It would have functionate.
But everybody was unbelong, because these distribution because these draws, because these during 3 weeks.
I have the days of a senator, who's still senator, "Immer saying, "Immmma.
The reason for the public and the long time, the representation was the representation.
The representation didn't want to do that what's going to do. They didn't want to be him.
Can you call it, and they're still going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
They wanted to give it the most free, the most painting, the most paintings that have a fellow.
This guy was "President.
President. They didn't existed the title. But he was invented. But he was suffering a valuable that someone who was a values.
It's like the idea of a jury.
He didn't have more size, as the recording "Anovation or "Auffer."
Sometimes, there were president little colonial community and government and government, but it was really an unbed.
So that's why the senating him.
They said, "That's smile, you can't call them President.
This cerrime must be different from the countries and out of countries.
Who gets him, if he's going to take a thumbling small title like President of America?"
And also, three weeks, the senating senating.
Instead of the collection of the title of the titledge, but they wanted to be absolutely, but they wanted to be absolutely not available respects of their own powerful role for the methods.
You can learn from three interesting things.
First, I think that's the best -- I've not going to find out if the senating whether the senating the titled.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just just just just a sense of the send of sending.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government is that something temporary -- then you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, the title, the United States of America," is not so finished today, ordinary, right?
This has more than 5,000 nuclearly than 5,000 nuclearly, and the greatest volcular volcular volcular volcular drones and a fly and this whole stuff.
We really have the story and story of the title.
And so the senat at the end of the end of the end.
They have a respectables title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of equality -- now, so that was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to sound like this, like the cerles with the 5,000 nuclearly, and solars and solar.
So the end of the send of senat and the representation, because no one's lost never been taking the case, if you're going to be a he said that you're going to be the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take with what you can do with the most important thing.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality and the reality, but actually changes, but actually change the reality of words of the reality of words.
Thank you.
So I got took a laster of about 50 rebelling a campaign for 30-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-olda.
I thousands of course, I'm going to have a pairs of lands of lands and couple of lands and they couldn't see a rockets that I couldn't even see a region that I couldn't even see it.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was slowly, I was writing with the war, all of the war, all the same pyjama-partys and football plays and football plays and fights and fights and religionalists and religionalistic distriction with the terminationalistry.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to do this, created afghane, Southe, Southeists, atheist and atheist and atheist and atheist and atheistances that are last nine years in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of good things that you could make a lot of things about the art, but I couldn't make a personality, but I want to make the point of art, I want to make the personality and cars and cars and cars and cars and carbon directly and reports of reports of reports and report
I want to spend a day in life of a distriction of a distriction that's drawers like "Popstar Bling Communists and popular blower and political creating and political corruption and political career.
And what's going to make the distance of the digital struggledge, and a choice and a choice and make a choice and make a choice and I'm going to make me! I'm going to make me.
And trying to use this campaign to use this machine to use this magnitude, as national holds.
I want to tell the corruption of the corruption of the reason, and you're going to take a project, and you're going to be a false of creating a false control.
I want to look at the conflict, like the conflict in Afghanistan created my mind.
The war and the wrote the free-called answered to him, and they created a new environment, and models that you can only a models that you can only a models and self-fordata and self-intermating.
And I'd like to see how a simple ships, and as a simple characters of appell of 1899999, to make a dialognize that the distriction of the creating the colonicies in the past.
But for all of these things, you can get in prison, they can get missing missing, they can be missing.
But I do it, because I have to do because I have to lost the operating self.
That's my last. Which is your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I worked as a model.
Since 10 years, right now.
I have the feeling that now, now, this is a unfortable spanning this guy, because I'd have to be able to stop.
And lucky, I have something to change something like to the way.
This is the first time, the first time that someone on TED stage, you can see, you can see, you can see, so you can see, I think that's happy.
If you were really a few women were really explained to tell me that I don't need to tell me that later, I'm going to twitter.
I also asked that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds, because I can think about 10 seconds.
And that's not everybody has not chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good, it's good, I didn't want to do it.
The most difficult part is to covered the pullovered my head, because then you'll be able to do all of you, you're nothing about my head.
In order.
Why did I do this now?
It was personally.
Well, it was hopefully like this picture.
One of the powerful, but a surface, but it's also operface.
I just have just changed your minds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this image -- I had never really never really had a friend.
I felt very unfortunately, and the photographically, I said, I'm going to be able to figure out with my hair.
And by the surgery or the wrong bridge, I was a little brunch of working for two days ago, there's just very few possibilities, and our question, and our question, and our question, and our surface, and our lives.
It's a possible for me today, today.
And I'm standing on this bow, because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this breaking a high, because I know, and I know, and in my branch.
I'm going to ask questions that people who are always standing, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means," but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model is a minor, and a mothers and a very important earth and maybe you're going to ask you, and maybe you're going to be.
Well, in the last few year, we have not only been beauty and young and young and young and young metrical defined, but we're going to be a biological, but also as a biological, but also finally, and half.
This is a same thing for me. And it's a result of me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Naomi, Tyra. Li, Li, Li, Li, Liuy.
And first, I'm going to comments, I'm going to be a model.
But I have to tell you that in 2007, that in 2007, a very slightly on the year of NYU, all the models on the launched every single day, and that every single one of 67, and that was booking money.
The next question that will always been telling me, "Kan I'm going to be a model if I'm going to grow up?"
And I said, "I know, I don't know, I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls really want to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be.
You can be presidentincesidentin of U.S. or the next Internet or a ninja-herzch, or a ninja-Dichterin, because then you would be a greater.
If they're still still still say, "No, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model," I'm going to say, "Who's my cows."
Because I have no responsibility and you might nothing the cheful cheful business or the American business or the next sky.M or the next sky.
To say that you're going to be a model, you'd like, you'd like to say that you want to win the jackpotto the lotto.
You can't religate it, and it's not a career, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, because of the model-works, because other than horrible, because it's just just just just just just just applications.
If there's a photographically, and you're going to be here, and you're going to be a cameron, and then you want to go to the cameron, and then you're going to go to the legs, and then the legs, and then the legs, and then the arm.
It's about this.
Hopefully more comic than that in the middle.
That was .... I don't know what happens.
If you look at school and a lifetime, and a few jobs, you can't tell you that you can't say that you can't say that you're going to be a lot of the United States, but in life, "10 years," you'll get to the United States.
The next question that's the question is, "Who's all photos.
And yes, so pretty much like this photos, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is all the most foto, which I didn't do that, and that was also the most painting a biciniode a biciniode.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girls.
So I just looked at a few months before, with my grandmother.
I'm at the day, this shooting.
My friends had to start with me.
This is me on a pyjama Pyjama Py, a few days ago, a skilling for the francial vogue.
I'm going to the football-Team and in the V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images of me.
It's created and it's created a group of profession of profession of profession and Make-up coast and photographs and photographs and stylists and the piece of their approduction.
Okay, asking people asking people, "Wever, you know, "Ko you know?
Yes, I have too many 20-cm-cm-clude I never met, but the things I'm not going to be the things I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it, and we're not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge and a day and a day and a day, I was in a launched my money, and you had the cambridge.
When teenager, I went to my friends with, a full-free-drived a red launched a red launched a red launch of course, "If you need to be a crimination," and we could go on.
I have this cost of cost of my exceptions, and nothing my personality and not because of my personality and there's a personality and not know, and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and they were filtered and last year and latest and Latinos and Latinos and learning.
It's live in New York only 17,000 young, men and latinos, for the question, "Who's not the question?"
And so, "How often, I'm going to be? When I'm going to start?"
And I found my rights for this talk to this talk about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year percent of their body.
The last question is, "How is, "How is it, a model of model?
And I think they're expecting these answer: "If you're a little bit more and global harm, and you feel very happy, then you feel very happy and fabulous and fabulous."
And Backstage, we'll give you a response that maybe this event.
We say, "It's really greative, so much, and it's greative, and it's a greative people, inspiring people."
Everything that's just the story, but it's just the story, because what we never might never said, "I never said, "I've never said, "I feel like," is," "I feel like, I've never feel like, "I feel like me.
And I feel like to think about my excurred to think about my exception.
And if you ask yourself, "Whould I be happy when I'd be happy when I thin, I thins and glense and glense?"
And then you should make a few mathels, because they have the thinner, because they have the most distriction and the most cool cool and the cool cool cool cool, and they're going to look at the most important women on the planet.
When I was very hard to tell me, he's very difficult to make me very difficult to create a very difficult to make me feel very uncomfortable, I felt very uncomfortable to tell me, and I got to tell me, and I got told me, and I got to get my grandmother.
It was very difficult to be very difficult to repression of unfortunately and rasks, if I'm going to be one of the largest nutrients.
But I'm also happy and feel like this, and I'm going to be here, and I've been able to do it, and I've been able to do it, I've been able to be able to be able to tell you about 10 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or two boys, I'm not going to telling my collow my
If you go from this talk about this talk, then you're all the power of the power of the power of the imagination and following and following.
Thank you.
I've never forget my grandmother nobody who never come together in the exilience, "Son, lifetime Gaddafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Wid.
But who never never going to be like a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the loby school revolution of revolution, inspiring the waves of the waves of the waves of the mass mass mass in the question.
I spended me with a lot of other libyers, inside and outside and outside of the corning a day of the corning and to studying a job and to strannic Revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Now, liby women and men and men and men, the first running the first rule, the end of the regimes, highly, write slogans and social generality in the air.
They have an example, they've been used to providing themselves by the brutal dictator Gaddafishing.
They have a strong sense of sense of sense of the most farmers, until the farmers, until in the south.
Finally, after after age of six months and five keps, and almost 50,000 taking our country, our country and the tyranies and the tyrances.
But Gaddafi has a big citizens, a large corruption of the tyranne, the corruption and the corruption and the course.
Four decades, Gaddafis decades, the Gaddafishing the infrastructure, as well as well as well as well as well as well.
The desertation and the challenge and the challenges, I wanted to know how many other women who are so many other women's civil society lybia, and we're going to make a civil social and national equalent.
And so, 200 organizations were during and unmediately and unmediately, and in Benghazi.
After 33 years, I got back to Lybia, and I started to Lybia, and I started to recording to the themen, I started to the themen capacity and leadershops and leaders and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women and women and women, I women, a women, a movement of women, a movement of women, and the distribution of women who are public healthy.
And when I met the paying on a very difficult environment, a very difficult to be a survey, a polarized by the ego. It was a graphics of dominance and ego.
I was a suffering away from peace and women and women, and women, and to make a laws, and a laws, a laws, a laws, and the right hands.
Initiative, our initiative, and he's successful.
Women women 17,5 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But long, but the eyes, every day, the euphories and the whole revolution, we thought, we thought, we thought of violence.
And one morning, we wake up to the money, we have change the money and Sufi-Gralter Mobe.
Another morning a morning, we were on the morning the American bothers and the message.
And again, again, the morning of opening the poor people.
And really, we're going to make a milize of the milize and their milize their milize their minds of rules and their power and their power and laws.
Our society, a revolutionary, polarization, polarized and polarized by the ideal and principles and principles, social Galance, social Greater.
Intolerancial, exploration and Rachewings of the question of the question of revolution.
I'm not there today today today with the successful, our reverse rivers and the choice and the choice and the choice and the choice.
So I'm a lot of today, I'm going today, as a nation, and the wrong choice and the wrong decisions.
We've been talking about our priorities.
Because the choice writing writing stability or sure, or sure.
Hat the reason laws and the white and the white between female and men and men and national various candidates and national various values?
No, she didn't.
What's it?
Why is going to be further and society and dominated by self-down politics of the dominance and the dominance and the dominance of men?
Maybe the women didn't have the only thing that has been female, but the female women's female, and the gnade and the gnade and the sense of the including.
Our society needs a national dialognitional dialogue, as they've been booking the choice, the choice and declination and decision and decade.
Our society needs to be the qualitative connection of the weible more than they need more than they need to need more than they need to need to be a woman.
We have to stop in the name of the name of the name and a day of the roach.
We have to start with the name of the middle of the gnade.
We have to develop a female discurs that wouldn't just asking wrong, but also the following, but also, collaboratt Rach, collaboratt Conks, a conclusion, a statts.
These are the ideal that's a completely crime lybia, to make peace to make peace to make peace.
Because the peace has a alchemic and in this alchemistry, it's about the feminal skulins and maskulin sort of sight.
This is the real reason white reluss.
And we have to existence, before we do it before we do it sociopolitical.
After a values from the coran "Salam" -- Fried "We's word of the word "Theemp."
The word "Theement," and all the time," and all of the traditional terrible, this same as the same as the word "The Mother word "Mother female," and the word "mothement, the whole final final final female.
And just like the motherleible the embryo, who's going to be completely completely sense of the middle of the middle of the entire existence.
And so, "My Gnade us, "My Gnade all things."
And so, "My Gnade us, "My Gnadeforcement."
Maybe all the gnade of the gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country, and I wished the best, and I'm trying to best."
And I was very strong.
In school, we were able to learned the story of climate, but we learned to learning about the world, extraordinary, South Korea and Japan our fine.
While I was often asked me, I thought, I thought I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything change.
With them seven years, I saw a public head of public he thought, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to live yourself.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter of war of sister of the sister of a collegin.
And that's stand: "If you're going to be our families, our families, because we've been able to be since weeks.
We're going together and our body and our body, and our body, we're going to die."
I was so hocked.
I heard to hear the first time, people in my country,
I went on the bottom of the bahnhof, and looked like a little bit more, I didn't get more from my memory.
A live light woman lag on the ground, and a board, and a half of their army in their army in the face.
But no one of them, because all of them because all of them, because all of themselves and their families, and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big charge hunger.
At the end of north Korean north Korean million northern Corean, and many otherwise, and many other survivor, because they just because they just because they're just because they're outside.
Stromously, more strange, so that's always getting me to switch me, extremely to the light of China on the other side of China on the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other s
I always asked me why they didn't have.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his night.
This is the river of the flower of the frocuss between North Korea and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China.
As you can see the river, the river, and it's very simple, and he's going to be the river.
But many sitting.
Sometimes I saw people in the flowers.
I can't tell you how I can tell you how I can say, but I can say that I can say that I can tell you that I could have been definitional change for China.
I thought I was suggest that I would be done by my family.
I didn't have thought it was 14 years to make 14 years together.
In China was very hard to live when young girls without family.
I had no idea of how the life of how the life as a northcorean flying. But I wasn't just extremely honest, but I didn't just extremely hard to be very hard. Becorean fish fish. Becorean fish.
So I lived in stress, I could be in starting to fly identity, and you'd being in a badfter northcorea.
One day, my greater alptraum, as I was true of Chinese police and in Chinese police and in the police and in the police.
Somebody who was important to be north Korean, so they did my chinese and my chinese and asked me, and asked me.
I had this kind of afraid, I thought of my heart.
Would be sort of course, I could be involved, I could be involved and down.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I did, but I did, my feeling my feelings, and I predictions.
After they were asking them with the exception, said, "That was a research.
It's not a north Korean."
And they went to go. It was a wonderful.
Some northcoreans in China in China in China in China, but many of Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and absolice and down.
These girls had great happiness.
Where they were expect, they were taken, they were finally free international printed international print.
These northcorean had not so much happiness.
Each year, uncomfortable northcorean and after North Korea, and after North Korea, where they're going to be publicly history.
While I was in my failure, I had a lot of other north Korean, not so much other north Korean.
It's tragic that north Koreaneran and hard to remaining their identity.
And as a new language, and a new language and works, their world, their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the hidden of the south corea to South Korea, and I've started a new life.
Mich in South Korea, no more than I didn't have a larger challenge, when I thought it was done.
English was in South Korea so important to learning my third language.
I have the great difference between North and south and southcorea.
We're all corean, but inside our innovation, we've been very expensive,
Identity, Identity.
If I'm South Korean?
Where's what do I'm going to?
Pludingly, there was no country more, that my home.
While I was the anpassion of the southcorean lives, I had a plan.
I'm already for the attention to the university.
If I was in my new life, I was a new life, I was a bad, I'm going to be a bad.
The northcorean body family, the money I was sent to my family, and as a street, and as a street, and as a street, and a drawing place.
They had to fast as possible as possible, so I started to plan.
North Koreaner has to be an unbelieved to their way back to their way back to their way.
It's almost impossible, the green and South Korea to talk about southern Ironically returned to China and I was going back to China and made me back to China and I made me back to the way.
Because my family doesn't have to talk to you, I had to live in more than 2,000 miles through China and then south Asia.
The busycluded a week, and weeks, and we've been taken.
One of the bus once, a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the experience of all the experience, questions.
And I didn't understand chinese family, I thought they'd being.
When the Chinese represent my family, I decided told him, and he said that they were decided to be able to decided to be able to do their attention.
He looked at me, I watched me, but happy, but happy.
We did it to create it up to the limited, but I had to be almost every money to border to borderships of Laos.
But even after we had the boundaries had been recorded to be my family inhavioral girls.
After I had gone money and sharping and sharped my family inside of a months, but I was inside of a month, I was in the city of Law.
That was one of the largest runship.
I had done everything to family to family to family, and we were so close, but my family, but my family.
I went up and family between the police and the police and trying to try to defined, and I was not enough money, but I didn't enough money, I didn't have enough money.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man, "What's losing?"
I was completely surprised that a friends.
In broken English and with a wombook with a womatched my situation and I went to create and went to a bankomat, and two money for my family and two family and two family and two family and two family.
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why do you?"
"I don't help you," he said, "I'm going to help.
"I help the north Korean humans."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The reviews are coming free-mbolized for me took me a new hope for me to show the northcorean, and he showed me the friendly, and he showed me the free friends and the supportunity of foreigns.
Finally, after our long running, my family and I recorded to southcorea, but the freedom.
Many northcoreans are done by their families and sobald them into a new country, and so they're not going to get a new country, and no money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us to help us to remote and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of us in contact with families, because many of us in contact with families, and we're going to change the hold, and we're helping them to change the hold.
I had a lucky, so much hope and inspiration inspiration in my life that I hopeful northcorean northcorean successful northernational success.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful northcoreans on the world, even on the world, even on the tED.
Thank you.
I've just a bit.
I don't tell me that I'm not normal.
Now, I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good and very good.
He can't talk to you, but he's communicated friends, like a few of the best reds.
Remi know what love is love.
He's part of it, and he's shared it unknown.
He's not just not just a real-called.
He didn't get to religious unligious unlike, and you've never been a light.
If he remember of our childhood, I'm not trying to remember the still, I remember a thing: how little bit about how little bit about how wonderful the unknown and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a absolutely unfortable memory.
but also has a soul.
He can't remember if he was remember, but he remember, but he reminded, but he reminding, but he was able to remember my iPod, he was four of the most four of the most four public four species of all the part of the bubble.
Do they don't know incredibly?
But many people don't true.
And in fact, because their understanding the society of normal values, they're often, they're oftended and false.
But what my heart, and my heart and my sea, and my sea, even though that was the case, even though they were not as a case, even though they were not just a certainly a meaning, that they were able to be autistic and Autistic and Autistic and Autistic and Autistic and Autistic and
Well, for the ones that don't know, that's not so fear with the reeflection of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, and sometimes the brains that are social communications, sometimes.
It's like any individual individual, it's remize, it's different than sample.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person Autism, and even though it's one of the most fastest growing evolution of the world, there's no familiar to the world, there's no coverage.
And I can't remember the first time I remember, but I can remember, but I can't remind me.
I was borning three years old, when my brother, and I was born, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He wrote a lot of it.
He didn't want to play how it didn't really interested in fact, and actually not very interested in me.
Remi, and regular world, and he was in his own world, and he found my own rules, and he found out how to found like the little bit of how to make a series of the room, and whatchmas, and whatchmairs.
And when he was differently, he was different and the differences were differently differently.
But behind the wood and the wood and the frust and the frozens, and the hyperactivity was something really a rulous non-scale, a recordable nobody who had a junge that never saw the world, who never saw the world, who never saw.
And then, including.
Well, I can't live investigating out of my family moments in my family, moments I wished, I wished that they were exactly how I knew it would be exactly.
But I'm going back to the thoughts that they've leaders that they've leaderships, communications and love, and love, and I don't want to understand that this is not a normality that I wouldn't want to tell you.
Normality, the beauty, the beauty, and the difference, and the fact that we're not differently, that we're not different from us.
It means that it's just a different kind of rich,
And if I just want to say a single thing, and then you might be, and then you have to be normal.
You know, you know, you're going to be.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a stories that we have a stories of us have a stories of us, and in all the street, and in all the ultimate opening of potential.
The chance on the size, research and walls and walls in the moment, in the moment, how someone else.
I don't say, I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgal representation, and neuroscience, with this photo on the projectil of a projectiled and apple to a million stuff of a million stage of a million skettle second.
But now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million times, and see the world, and see the world, but a billion pictures per second.
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography, the female photography, a new approach, which is that they can actually make it happening in movement of light in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can buildings of our situation or not to look at education or notes, or without a beautiful body, and really can ask our body, and really, and really, and really,"
If I'm going to take a light and takes and him in a billion sketches, and they're going to be a created a packages, I'm going to create a potones, and that's a billion timeter, and this project, and this project, and this project.
So if you take this projectil, this project, and you take this photones and it seems like this fire, how are going to be in the flashoton?
How do you see light in time?
So, this whole events --
So, think about it, the whole events, the whole eventually, more than a nanoseconds -- so light, so light, but I need to return this video, but I'm going back to the factor, and I'm going to see the factor.
No, Coca-Cola has not financial research.
So, in this movie, so much, so let me show you what happens and show you what happens.
The puls, our projectil, our project, the flower to a photonpaket a package, and it's start to move into the bright.
A part of the light, you see the table, and you see these table, and you see these expectations.
Many of the potones, the last few last the last the rivers of the rivers and exploding different directions.
As you can see, you can see there's air, which is airls that area.
While the waves are reflecting the table and while the table and while the reflexions of the reflexions of the reflexions of the focus on the end of the focused.
If you have a quite projectility projectility and that's the same strong and the video and the video, and you know, you know, how long you know how long you know how long you have to see how long you have to see the film.
A day, a week, a week, a very last year.
That would be a very long movie, a very long film -- from a long projectily projectil in movement.
And how do you see something stills with something stills?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the wall, and the wall.
It's like if you have a sentence.
If you look like this, as a photo mature, a photo matter, yeah, but of course, but of course, of course, of course, of course.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if you'll see the light, that if you're going to remaining these far.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and the light, and the light, and the light and after after after after after after that.
So, in the future when these future, if these female camera in your camerahandy, it could be able to be able to be able to be able to make a surround, and you can retirection, without any career.
So how did my teamera was built this camera?
So when you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you have a photo, you have very little light, but we've got very little light, but we've got a billion times more faster than your career than your light, so well.
So we're going to do this project, we've got this projectil, this project, million and shows the simplicity and recording and recording to combine these gigabytes of data, and we've got this figure.
And we can take all these roohdata and so interesting things.
So, superman can fly fly.
Other hells us to make us a new sense, but how would it be able to see a new south for a careful south?
The idea is that we're going to streets.
It's going to be able to go back to the space, a part of it, and then you'll reflecting and finally reflecting these more and we could use this light, and we could use this light.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built it.
Links our femto-to-camera.
Here's a puppeared, and we'll be able to represent the door.
After our approaching in the "Nature Communication" was published by Nature.communication.communication, and they have this animation.
We're going to be able to record them to be able to get a little bit better and then you'll get a little bit better and then you're going to be able to be able to get the couple of the light, and then we'll get the light, and then the door, and then the door.
And because we have a camera that's so quickly, our female, our abilities.
She has a very good time, and she can look at the world in Light, and they can look at the world.
And of course, of course, but also the door, but also the door, but also the covered objects, but we don't know what we know.
Indeed a laser on the survive, we can take a robots, how they're going to see -- not really sense of the screen, but if we see a lot of these images, and then we're going to try together and trying together and try together and try to try to do different lights.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit of course, we can see the lab, we can see the practice, we can see the cars, we can see the collisions, and we can see what't see what's going to see on the curve, or we can look at the curve.
But because of the blood and violence of course, of course, which is a way to think of scientists, and that's why well, now, now, now, and now, and then a new female.
So, how we can make a created a scientists, and there's a scientists, a cell photography, a cell photography, and I was able to make all these gigabytra-contraphytes that we can't just knowledge of data that we don't know, not just know, not just knowledge
But it's also happening here.
If you look at this waves, you see that waves, you see that the waves of us, you see that the waves.
The waves to us to move around us.
What happens here?
It turned out that we've almost in Light, because we have almost in light, same Effects and an instein, and a same Effects of this image.
The reason why, in the events in the world, in the world, he's going to be able to decided to reflection, so you can relationship of space and time, and time you can relationship, and time, and time we can use this consumption.
So, if we were able to family to figure out how to make the medicine, and we should be able to creating a new data, and we've been able to relationship with our data and data and data and data and data and data and the data and the data and the data and the dat
It's about the time. Thank you.
There are many ways of our opportunities of our lives.
We don't make any night, we're not going to be so that we're not going to use a lot of ways. But we use the same public place.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighborhood and shared and circules and circleber, slones and circle.
The projects of my questions from my questions like a lot of mine, how much message my neighborhood?
How do we stopping more things without us to stop sitigate?
How do we have leaderships of buildings and the country and the country?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so that our communities, our communities and tears and tears and tears and tears?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea is going to be huge economics that are hundreds of years of love for hundreds of years, beds and tears and tears and tears, and I'm always talking to the city of a city.
I think every time any time any time, anyone, there's no one plleans a parade.
In this city of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but they're also the city of the city of most of the city of America.
I live in the narrative and I have this house, how I thought it could be a little bit about something that changed my life for life.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death, and it was a suddenly and unexpected.
I have a lot about death, and I was a big disease, and I was a big disease, and it brought me about the things that are important.
But it's hard to me, these sort of view of each day.
It's easy to lose to lose and lose what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I'm going to be a huge amount of hope, and I wrote a big dying the lucky, "Bevorite, I want to be a satellow.
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could experiment, but the next day, but the next day, and they're always been stilling and they're always further.
I want to share some sentences that were divided by people who were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to be stered piratrator, I want to be clear."
"Bevor I want to stay, I want to standing on the International Datums."
"Bevor I want to singinginging for million people."
"Bevor I want to sterve a tree."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netzunabhan."
"Bevor I want to ster, I want to still half age."
"Bevor I want to be stered, I want someone."
"Bevor I want to be song, I want to be myself."
This is a laughter place, and the sense of a sense of sense of hope and tears and tears and tears, and the laughters and translates me.
It's about knowing that you don't know anyone.
It's about how we understand our neighborhood and second, and it's a new way.
It's about it, place for best, and to remind and remember and remember what we're most important to change what we're growing and change ourselves.
I did this last year, and I did this, and I have a lot of people who wanted to make a community of people who walls that have been building a wall, and I wanted to build a colleagues, and now I've been able to change the world, and now.
We have a lot of power our power our public place, if we have the opportunity, our voices, and more with other voices.
Two of the most valuable things we have time and the relationships.
In a world with creating a world with creating a little bit less than ever before, the right thing with the right blend of the right blend of life, and think that the life and it's a little briefly.
We're often to talk about death to talk about death to think about death to think about it, but I realized that the idea that the death of death of death of death, which is one of the things that most strong.
The idea of death the death of death the death.
Our common sentence of place where we can see what we can do with us as a community and as a community, and as a communities, and we can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me with me with me, a particular problem for every problem for every problem for everyone who are consumption, is that we're going to be companies.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to tonight today, I'm going to tell you what I do.
Tances is one of the human activities.
We're going to be in the mind of most of us areas of most of users and skills and same stuff.
To balletting a very extraordinary ball in Cennism and capacity and abilities and abilities, and possible evention that could have a genetic components.
Traurode, neurological stories like Parkinson long-son long-son long-solution. It's also doing it with my repling, and that's what was a ballettuose.
And over the years, you have a lot of researchers in the mission.
Trotzdio, there's a six, 33 million people who live in this disease, and they have to live with the uncomfortable symptoms like symptoms, skills, and other surface, and other disease.
We have to have to read the rest of objective mind, and last few possibility, really, if we have a single possibility, if we have a question that question.
<unk>rator is that there's no relationshipson and other movements, so you can't just biombs, so you can't just biombs. It's this 20 minutes.
You have to him in the clinics. It's very expensive, and it means, and that means that's not going to be clearly nobody.
But what if patients, if patients?
That would be a certain tour in the hospital. What would be patients, what if patients?
It wouldn't be a teensional disease.
It costs ended 300 percent, in the neurological approaching the neurological approach.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods, with the method that we're trying to reaching, because we're all senses, because we're all senses like my repling.
Here's a video of video of video.
This is what happens in healthy when someone who's going to be able to look at all. We can look at the coordinate, because we can look at all of these stimmorgane, because we have to coordinate the coordinate, and we all have to do is.
And as Ballet, it's enormously,
Think about how long a children, until it to talk to it.
And so we can read the position of the vibrating stimmlipps. And as the gly, and as the gly, and as the stimmorgane.
On the recording to the example of an example of unregular stimulatorial stimulates.
We're always see this symptoms.
Stimmor, swaking swaking swaking swaking.
The language is even language, and it's a little bitter and that's an example of it.
Thank you, you can be in the voice, sometimes, sometimes, but with thought, but with thoughts and presentation and presentation, combinated with new powerful, combinated with new cells.
How can these tests with clearly, you know? Well, they're not both cannot both the neurologists.
And infrastructure. The infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. There's not being the stimes are not by experts.
So you can be self-down,
They're very quickly, you're going to make 30 seconds.
They're very billiant and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also be in great massive.
And this is the first sort of all the same thing.
We can reduce logistic switch for patients.
Patients don't have to retrolinics in clinics.
We can make surely objective data,
We can getting mass mass mass massive studies and recruities and first of the first time and first of all the population of the whole population of realization.
We have the opportunity to look for Biomarkers for the biomarkers, before it's too late it.
Today, we're going to do this range, we started the parkinson'son's sunitiative.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of stimulate number of stimulate enough enough enough to bring enough to the exciting for the exciting of these goals.
We have space that space that are divated to a billion people on this planet,
Everyone, or without parkinson, can be representation to get a few center to a few center for a few center. I'm going to be able to get six percent of our goal,
Thank you.
If you say, we're going to say 10,000 people say, you can say, who's not going to say who is not going to say?
What's going to do with all of these probably?
What happens is that the patient as the patient of the calls, whether these parkinson, whether these parkinson,
Some of them may not to create the end.
But we're samming a huge database, underground, which is interesting. These are important. These are important, because we're important, because we're actually important to fascinates, which are the real marker for parker for parkinson.
For excited her 86 percent Genermany?
It's much better.
My snake a thanasis -- I have to love it, because he's so fantastic worked -- now has been working on the mobile phone, and it's also working on the mobile phone, and we're going to be able to be 999 percent.
This is what I call a better.
That means that people can make people -- the people can make people can make the cell phone and the testing people with parkinson's stimulate their voice, so that they can take their doctor, so that they can make their doctor of the crime.
And so, right?
Thank you. Max Lady, my dames and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
So here's what I live in Kenya on the southern Randi-National parks.
In the background of my father and the cows of my father and the cows the cows of National Park.
The Nairobi national park is just in the south, it's just standing. It means that wildlifebras the parkets like cebras the park.
The reaction that represent the solutions, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that were killed. I wake up. I wake up and I thought it was a great box. It was our only bull. It was our only bull.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we believe that we've been able together with our animals and the way of the sky.
I learned to learned to have solutions.
Our warrior current morans. They're going to protect our struggledge and our case. They're not along the problem.
and killed the solutions.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobians.
And I think there's a national park, there's just solutions, just so few solutions.
In my stamm is a junge between six and new years, and nine years of his vators.
I had to find a solutions.
My first idea was fire. Lions. Lions for a fire.
But then I realized that we would help us to help us to help us to see the cows to see the cows.
But I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to a vogel.
I wanted to be the solutions, I thought I was stage.
But solutions are very clearly clear.
They come up, you see the vogels and go back. Beime, but they'll come up and say, and they're still not going to be here.
And they're going to killed our viety.
One night, I wake the case. I love with a fackel in the cell phone around him and that sometimes the lions.
Lions for a light, the light, that's moving.
I had an idea.
Shone as little boy worked on my room, I was in my room, and I took the new room, and near the new roadio of my mother. Anyway, but I had a lot of electronics.
I took age old cars and a robattery and a motorrad. The left. The right. The right. It's right. He wants to be able to be blind.
And I was a words, I was a switch, and from the light and out of the light.
This is a little birth of a captured taper.
And then I built everything.
The solar panels the battery, the battery, the battery, I call it the range. I call it a transformator.
And the relationship.
You see that the births to show you the outside of there, because of the solutions.
And this is what it looks like this, if they come to the solutions.
The light blinks and the solutions and the solutions, I was about the case.
Thank you.
I have this solve this installed and since we didn't have a problems.
And then we hearing our neighborhood.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and lost their animals and she asked me, I could ask her light.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
Since I've been seven houses of neighborhood with the light, and they're really good.
My idea is now going to be used in all the cenyces, even for other robust or leopards or leopards, the lights. The lights.
My experience, I'm going to a stipendium on a stip of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse international schools.
My new school, and holding and helps and helps and helps and recording.
I even my friends with my friends with my friends and common installing the light, and I'm not going to show the people, and I'm going to show the people, and I'm using them.
I just a year ago, a year of Savanne, who was high-father cows. I saw fright, I was going to look at me and said, "I'm going to sit down in a sit.
And here's what I'm going to do.
I thought with a plane with a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a great, I want to be airplane and pilot. It's my great dream.
From my five solutions, but through my support, I can return the cows of my father and the solutions and the solutions, and we can live without side, without the solutions, without stread.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I thank you very much.
You know, you know, you know how you're not like you're talking about your story like your story like your story.
So you've got this stip, yes. Yes.
You're working on other electrical supports.
What's the next on the list of listen?
My number of success, I'm working on a electrical caunch. It's a electrozaun?
Yes, I know, electrical cases are already, but I want to have my own, but I want to have my own.
You've already to try to try to try to try to do it, I've tried to try to try to try to give you a shadow, because I got a shadow.
All of the beginning is hard Tures, you're a little bit of a best.
We're going to be able to reflect your friends, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm since I'm a camera in the hand, is photography, I want to share with you today with you today with you today with you, and no one of my favorite.
There was no kind of director, no chance, no chance, no chance, no chance. Not a picture. Not even the reflection.
To being able to believe most of the most predictions of tourists.
My story begins when I was in New York, and my wife, and my wife, and my wife, and my first time on my first time on my first time on my arm, and we were on my arm. We were on the economy of 57th.
And so we were later, we were recording back into New York and so we decided to look at the same picture.
Well, you can see what you can see, what's going to see.
When the thirday, my daughterday, my wifey, "Hey, why, why don't get it to New York and do it a father and do it a father order to reitual for the ritual for the ritual for the ritual for the ritual for the ritual forest of the r
And then we started to make a picture of tourists, a picture of us.
You know, it's pretty much like universality is when you're going to be a completely fully free.
Nobody has ever said no one has no lucky, and it's not never ever done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much of our lives.
These recently, very hold.
This is just after the weeks after the 11. September, and I had to explain what happens to understand what's happened.
These images are much more than just a fear-making moment, or a certain returned returned.
They're also a way of a week for a week, and as weeks and how we change our time and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical but in all of us.
Because if we do this, we're always change our perspective of males. While they're always reaching the oceans, and I'm going to see the life with their eyes, and how they see it.
These are very intense very intended with each other, and every year we're going to be a little budget and every year.
Last, while a last one of our records, we're talking about it, and place them, and they're going to show them how they showed a red launched markets, and they'd like a small children, like a little children,
And they told me of their feeling of their feelings that they had as a five-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-old.
She said they remember how to remind the heart of the breast, when they saw the first time they saw the first time they saw the first time.
And now they looked into New York, because they want to study, because they want to study in New York.
And I realized, I realized, the most important thing we all created, are allowing.
And so I want to share with you, I want to share with you, a active role in the memory of memories of memories.
I don't know how it looks like it, but I'm going to look at this 15 pictures, I'm going to families.
I'm always doing the image.
I want to talk today today today, within the image, and you're not going to ask someone who do you asked you a picture of us?"
Thank you.
