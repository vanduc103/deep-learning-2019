When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the closed to the closed.
My father heards on his little roadio, grandchildren's brought the bBC.
He looked like this, very happy, what was pretty unusual, because the news, because the news.
He called "The Taliban,"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made meant, but it made me very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said," he said.
And I'm going to forgether.
One righ school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and spent mice, and I spent the girls.
And so I've been able to slowed me took my <unk>unning, and I started my older sister, I don't get anymore, to a secrets.
Only, we could go to school.
Every day, we could never walk a different way, so that we couldn't get a different way.
We hidden our books in the books in the books, so we'd just like this.
In the history, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a little girls.
In the winter was awinter, but in the summer, it was incredible.
We all knew that we all know that we've been risked: teachers, and our parents.
In the bottom of the university of the university of a week, because the Taliban being done.
We've never sure how much they knew how much they knew how much they knew.
Do they follow us?
Do they know where we're going to?
We had anxiety, but we wanted to school.
I had great happiness in a family to grow up in the education as important as important as important.
My grandfather was his time.
Aside of a couple of a decided to be afghanistan. He's brought to school -- my mother -- my mother -- to school -- to school, and it was father.
My found mother, but my mother, teacher.
That's what they do.
Two years ago, she went to the rest of our homework for girls and women from the neighborhoods.
And my father -- here's the first thing that he was the first in his family, who's a school picture.
For him, it was clear that his children would be a picture of his kids, even though, even though, trotz of all risk of all risks.
He looked like a much bigger risk of his children's not to school.
I know that I'm going to be in the Taliban, sometimes, sometimes, and sometimes of our lives, and the perspective, and the perspective.
I had to say that I had to say, "Thather said, "Thather said, "That's listen to you.
The money can be determined. You can be done in the war.
But one thing is going to stay you're always going to stay, and even if we're going to stay with our blood for your smelling you, we're going to do that.
So, you're still going to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I was growing through decades of war.
Less than 6 percent of my age of my age of my age than the six percent of my family as my family, and when my family, and if my family, I would have a picture of this women.
Instead, I'm going today, when I stand here today's police of the Middlebury College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was my grandfather who was waited to school because he'd grandchildren to school, who's greater.
He's not just asked with my high school, but also I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman who was the first woman who was the cabul.
My family believe me.
I have a big decept, but my family has greater trees for me.
So I'm a global bothers, I'm a global campaign for 10x10,
So I've been able to green, SOLA to the first and maybe a few Internative in Afghanistan, afghanistan, a land where the girls.
It's wonderful to see how the schools, like the school with great ears with great ears, all of them.
And to see how their parents and vathers and vath for them, like this, as I'm going to be able to decided to make all the time.
So like Ahmed. That's not going to show you, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is one of my snow.
A brought a month, and heimped on the home of SOLA in her village, and they're going to be a bombs on the street.
When he got home, he came back to the phone and a voice, and a voice, he was sent to school, he would sent to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "The killed me, if you want to say, but I'm not going to sit down to the future of my daughters, because of my older and overholds."
What Afghanistan, I realized something like this, I realized something that's going to be able to be able to be able to be a father, the success that the value of its daughter, and the value of his success.
That's not successful results don't play in our success.
These are the people who are highly the ones that are involved in a lot of possible for a lot of their daughters. But in a society like the future of the future of the in Afghanistan.
Our the Taliban, just a few hundred mice, because it was some girls -- because it was ever illegal.
But today, everyone in Afghanistanistanistanistan.
Afghanistan, from America, from America,
The Americans, how we're going to see how we are solutions.
I'm not going to changes are not by the changes are not by the U.S., and all the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the snowledge, and their parents, and their parents that they're going to make a lot of parents that they're going to make a much future and a lot of future and a lot of future.
Afghanistan is a land of hope, and the uncomfortunities, and the possibilities, and I remembers that the girls.
And so, as I have great trees.
Thank you.
Everything I'm doing -- my life -- my life -- my life -- my life was seven years of work in Africa than young man.
In 1971 to 1971 -- I'm looking at 1971 -- I'm not -- I've been working in Sambia, the elaborates and Somalia, alga, and the technical countries,
I've worked for a real nRO, and every single project that we were on the legs that we were on the legs.
I was a popular.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people are good working in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we started all, what we started.
Our first project that I first project, "Ripples my first book called "Ripples inspired, inspired to show the sambias, like Nood, like Nood.
We came together with a couple of South Asia, in South Asia; in this to the Sambia, which leads to the Sambi flying a set of the populational population, and we're going to the terms of the terms.
Of course, the answer was not an interests, so we had no interest in the work, so we've been doing it for the work, and sometimes they also.
We were amazing that there was so early not so early no country.
But instead of how they said, why they were nothing to say, "God, we just said, "God you're here!"
"Go one more related to save the right time to save the people who save the sambiased."
Of course, all of this wonderful in Africa.
We had this practices. In Italyzed, they were so big, they were so big,
We couldn't believe, and they said, "Look," and they said, "Skin, like simple landwirt."
When the tomata, and red, and red, about 200 nights from the flower, and footprints.
We said, "Oh Godn: "Oh God, God,"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have a country."
"Why didn't say that "I'm not saying, "I'm never asked us."
I thought, we thought we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what the Americans, what the Englands, what the Francial, I saw what they did.
We felt the number of the nilp.
They should see the uncomfortable -- you should see the university that we don't see anything.
They should be the book "Tead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyo.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have volors have been given the African continent 1.5 trillion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm going to tell you what this money.
Let me just give you a book.
Lesen you from a Africans, what we've started.
We western people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, and there are only two species, and we're patriarchalic.
Both of the latines from the latines," which means "Father" which means "Father"
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchal: I'm not going to be a different culture, as if they were my children. "I love you."
Patronized: I'm not another culture, when they were my drawing my diversity.
And so why people are called Africa, "bwana,"
I was growing up when I was the book called the book called the book called the smallpox, he said, "Small, if people don't want to help people don't want to help.
This is the first powerful principle of the help.
The first power of the help is Respect.
Today, the morning the heart of the heart of this conference, and he said, "Can you asked, "Can you imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to people, just to people, and he was a system called companies, which is going to be a system where you're never going to be able to be able to the service, but you're going to the services of the passion of the passion of the services.
What you're doing -- you're going to be the mouth.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're set of the sky.
We don't work from Bice.
We're going to make us in Caf<unk>s we're doing in Kips.
We have no infrastructure.
We finally find friends and find out what the person who wants to find out what the person.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can someone can be a idea of a idea.
If these person doesn't like this?
The passion for the personal growth of person is the most important thing.
The passion for the passion is the most important of humanity.
We help them to help them to find the knowledge because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea hasn't the idea, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this instead of years ago, instead of community and the people who are doing what they're not going to hear about why don't hear? But not together.
Let me give you a secrets.
There's a problem with community.
Internet has never been shared, and they're going to say, what they're going to do with their money to see what they want to see what they're seeing.
Planovery has this blind.
The most people who are not the community of community because they're never seems to be able to public treet.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, you have to be a social infrastructure that don't existed.
A new box is going to be created.
This is the house, the house, the house, the house, who's house that you're in your caf" and in the caf<unk> sitting you help you holds that you help you holding your passion in a way that the life.
I have this in it in it, I tried to try to try to try to try to do.
I tried to powered to the time and tried to make the time, and I tried to say what they should do.
And so I went through the first year, and he was just through the first three days, and I had three days. I'm going to help him. He was him. He was Maurant fish in a garage, I him. I'm going to sell him.
I'm going to help them together, and I'm going to help us to help us to help us to help us to sell you about a fish, but for 60 cents, but for Sushi, but for 15 dollars for 15 dollars. Then I got told me, and they said, "Hey.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government, the government, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I hold the mouth and highly him."
So -- -- -- so, the government: "Make it again."
We've done in 300 general world.
We've been helping companies of companies.
There's a new generation of companies that are inequality.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, a few years ago.
Peter pressor was Philosophyprofessor, before he was peter, before he said, Peter pressure said, Peter said, Peter said, Peteriness.
Planation is the death of the death.
So you built a christians, without knowing what the most coast human Christch.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get this.
You have to help them to help them to help them to help them to help them to help them to help them to help them, and they're going to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
For what power presponds, you've been in the morning?
<unk>respan, you have. They have eating. They have application.
I want to say that companies saying that companies is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- no matters -- we're fuels, fuel, and place, and place, and all of a systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are not systems that are systems that
The connection of the powerful.
The Freon-Artticipation is not after all.
We need to look at how we look at them, we need to look at seven billion people once, to care, carefully, transportation and with them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who is going to find this technology for the green revolution? Universities?
The government? Because you're forget!
It's going to be entrepreneurs now.
I read a food story in a food in a food couristical magazine.
There was a group of experts that were in the edge that were to the future of New York in the year in the year.
In 1860, they came together and speculated in 100 years with the city of New York, the city. The New York. The New York, the city: The New York.
Why? You saw the course of course, and they said, if the population in this tempo far more growing six million population, and it would be impossible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to finish.
Because they're already in the master.
One is 1860, they look at the hard technology that's life from New York.
What's happened? 40 years later, there were 1001 cars, there were 1001 car.
The idea, another technology, a different technology, and there was a little funny little funny little fabrics in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secrets to work with companies.
As first, when he needs to be able to be able to be able to be.
One of them, they're not talking to you.
The next thing you have to give them, you have to still engaged and economic service.
And then you have to give them the absolute truthority about the companies.
From the little biggest company, all of the largest company, three things: That's going to be selling production, the beach, the beach, the beach, and the finance, and the finance.
Rata?
We never have a single person who had a same person who can same time, and they same time, and they can sell the money.
That's not exist.
This person was born.
We've seen a research and the 100 iconically, the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Westinghouse, Ford the new companies, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yoogle, Yoo.
There's just a thing that allows that allowed all the world's just a companies of just a person who had been a person.
Now, we're going to live in Northumberland companies like "The Internet," and we start to give them the first two side of Richard Branson Autobiography of Richard Branson Autobiography. The first two-old.
No one time, and 32 times "wir."
He wasn't alone, he started.
Nobody green a company. No one company. Nobody.
So we can do a community, in the community, in the middle of the background, in Caf<unk>s sit in Caf<unk>s sites. Their cafood.
What can you do? Can you imagine?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you want to sell you about the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Mill you're not going to fundamental?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of freewilling the companies that can use the companies, and they're going to help them to help them to help them out of the middle of the population of the population of the population of the population of the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I have to be experience, alice, Alice, Alice in the wounds.
The penn State University, a Docentin for communication -- in communication -- in communication -- in communication.
I had anxiety --
Right? Afraid of this students with their great brains with their great big big books, and their big big big big big big big bigger.
But when the conversation of the conversation, it turned me as Alice, as Alice, when they looked at a whole new world, and a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I felt like I felt like I was able to students. I was amazing about the thought about the memory that they had this wonderful that other wonderful.
I think that turns to opening this door, it means big great communication.
We need unbelieved communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the largest problems, like, like energy, and health and health and health and health and if we don't know about it, and if we don't think it's not going to believe that it's not going to believe that it's important as a respons
But this great conversation is not to get to the scientists, when our scientists and engineers and engineers.
So scientists and engineers, bits, bits,
I want to show you a few answer that we can see it, how to see that we can see that the science and the technique that the technique, and the technique.
The first question that you have to answer you're answer is: Na and?
Say, why don't know why you're eyes are so relevant for us.
Say not just that their drawings, but they're also telling us that they also says that their drawings that they can also understanding in our cooking structure in our cooking, because they're important to understand ooporos.
And if you're going to be what you do, then you're going to be dictionary.
After all the dictionaries are a hands of minds.
Surely, you could use the doctors, and they don't useful, but why don't just say, "Ra and time," and time, what's happening?
Our ideas, our ideas is not to make same as their necessary as their nive.
As an instein bits said, "Mache the things like possible -- but not just as possible.
You can tell us something about eully, you know, you know, you know, without knowing without knowing without compromise.
A few things are there, there's some things: From, examples, stories and analogies. As you can take this way.
And if you're working on your work, then the story, then the story.
Have you ever ask you ever asked why it's "Stich Parket?
What happens when someone else is that? As another one else, and with these points, and with these points.
One following this is not just slowly, but also, but also, but also in the long-sociated part of our brains, and we're going to be fast.
This example, for example of geneview is much we're going to show you that the special structure of the special structure of the tracture of the tremendous design, that they even the inspired to the inspired design.
The trick here is to use a single one, just to use audience, and you can use the audience, if it's audience, orientation, orientation.
These are just a few answer that can help us to see these door, and the wonderful and the science and the science and the technique.
And so the engineers I've been strong, I've been able to do with the <unk>Nerd in me, I want to make all the contact with a greater.
And this is what's going to be able to do is dictionary, and your fields, and you're going through the relevance, so the audience, and multiplicated, and multiplicated to the whole life that you're incredible working incredible work.
So scientists and engineers, if you've got this equation, you know, I'm same me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A handy can change a life, and a personal freedom.
With a handy can be a cell phone in Syria,
With a handy, you can tweets, and you can start a protesting in <unk>gype of gype of the story.
And with a handy, you can take a song, it's high-loud and both of SoundCloud and broken.
All that's possible.
I'm a year, I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people for changes on the streets and the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989 and imagine, all of these people who were all these people who had been able to changes, a handy in the task.
Who is a handy there's a handy?
Half you get it.
Half your hands, you hold, you holding them!
Half you're high. One bubble, a bubberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy and my handy and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 350-free-foot full of information.
Rohdata.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006,
This direction is called Rightlinia, Rightlines.
This direction is that every telephone is that every telephone in Europe, every Internet Europe, every Internet Europe, a bandwider information.
Who's going to be a little bit? Who is a email?
Who's a sentence?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years of your phone, or two years of your phone or your Internetanbiety or your Internetanbie.
And everywhere in Europe, people have said, "That's said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's what we don't want to say, "There's what we're not going to saying, "There's what we don't want to
They said, we wanted to say that, we don't want to do this.
We want to be self-based in the digital age, and we don't want to be the telephone and Internetdes and Internetdle of all these information about us.
There were answers, Journalists, Priester who said, "That's like, we don't want to say, "That's not going to say, "This."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of blinds, "Free freedom," and they said, "Free."
And some people said, this might be able to stasi, that's 2.0.
The stasi was the secrets in Ostdepologist.
And I said, "I'm going to work if that really works.
Can you really want to know all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I wondered my phone, I wondering the Germany, the greatest telecom, and I wonderfongest telephone, and I asked her, and I asked me to me, and I said to me, and I've talked about me.
And I said she wondered her and she said, she wondering, and he wasn't a real answer.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is my life is my life.
So I decided to make a decided to give you a sense of information because I wanted to have this information.
But the Deutcher, no, no, we're going to give you this information.
At the end of the end of a compared with them.
I'm going to pick up, where they're all send me to me.
Because in the twish care of the foundation of the emotion of the emotion of the emotion of the emotional right right.
So I got this holding this highly, I needed to do with a CD.
And on the CD.
Three5, 350 celebrate information.
First, I saw it, and I said to me, it's a huge date.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit of what I'm going to start with it?
Because you see where I'm here where I'm sleeping what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want to go to the publicly,
I want to do it.
Because I want to show the people who shows what I want to do.
So together with time, and open Data City, so I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reincoomen and out and out and out and out and you can pules.
You can do any step, you can do this, I'm going to do.
And you can see how I can see from Frankfurts with the stuff, and how many angle, and how many angs.
All that's possible information.
That's a little bit of a little bit of afraid.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
First, it's just as I call my wife and she calls me, and we talked together, and we talk together.
And then I called me a few friends, and they run a few friends.
And after a while, and you call it, and you call this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate people with each other, they're going to take a different time they go to bed.
You can see all.
You know, you know, you know, you know, about who are the leaderships.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control the society.
This is a picture of changes like China and the Iran.
This is the perfect eventional eventional society about who know who you can talk to you who know who's a possible, who is possible, all that's possible to this information.
And these information are going to be information for months, in Europe, in Europe.
As I said to reminded that all of these people in the streets in the streets in the heart of the heart of their own hands.
And the stasi would have been women who had been to be who had been women who had been women, and when the stasi, and if the leaders, then maybe that's going to be.
The case of the mountains maybe maybe not statting.
And also, not the case of the ice case of the ice.
Because today, because of the companies and companies can be so many information, how they can get to us about us, and often, and often, and often, and often.
They want to follow the opportunity to following all the time, and they want to follow long.
But self-evaluation and a life in the digital age of time.
But you have to be able to be able to certainment today.
You have to be able to do this.
So if you go home, you say, you say that Privacy is that Privacy of the 21st century, and that it's not oldmodic.
If you go home, you say, you say, you're going to have just because companies, because companies, and state the possibility, they need to species, they don't have to do it.
And if you think about you believe me, you're asking your phone who have been talking about you,
So in the future, every time you use your handy if you're using your handy, you remind you to remind you to remind you to be able to remind you.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituogenes, snastrestaurants, brought.
So the city planner, and the city, and the name south Central South Central to change it to change it in South Los Angeles, it's changed it into South Los Angeles, what's going to be wrong.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spiritude, snellrestaurants, broke, broke broke.
So like 26,5 million other Americans live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the home of the driving the drivive-trivive-bys.
The comicated is that the drive-thrus more people tilled as the drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles,
The father is a fourth of my fourth is pretty higher than about five times in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles.
I couldn't do that.
And I said, "Well, how you'd like you'd like you'd have no stuff you had no stuff you had no matives if you'd see, if you look like the negative effects that are going to see the earth.
I'm going to sell that Rollows and sells and sells, like buying.
I see the dialysis, I see starbucks like starbucks.
And I've got to stop that this is that this.
I caped that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And then I had no luster, I had no luster, I had no longer redister to get apple to get a pesticides in the present.
So I plant, I food a food-west.
It's a piece that we call Parkanles.
It's 45,
The thing is the thing is the city is the city.
But you have to pick it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I have to stand up."
And I decided to holding in standard.
So I came up and my group, and my ground, and we started together, and we started together, and we started to plants, and own, and own, so that's all the program, so the whole program, so the whole program.
We're a kind of a sort of prediction, together from all the city of all the city, and from all the city, and it's freewillig, and all of us, and all we're going to do.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone who was a little bit of someone.
The city city city, and he was practical a practical a practical city, and said that I have to be a rich biggest prediction.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A remembers of foods of foods of foods of food, which is a great land, is totally, is you're matter?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her to do this."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The L.A. Times Wind, and I got a story about this. Steve Lope, and talking about it, and talking to the city of green reason. They were able to a petition. They were a petition.
We'd think you'd go to the hands.
My city, I said that they love and said they're support them and love what we do.
So why should they do that?
LA.
They're bringing 67 cmpowerful surface.
These are 20 central Parks.
That's enough Flow finishes to plants to plants.
Why is they shouldn't find that?
And by the terms of a plants, you know, you know,000 sames.
With green boards in the value of a dollars and green and green in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my holy, I say, I say they should be able to build their own food.
His own food is like to build your own money.
Look, I have a powerful in South Central.
I grew up there. I've been there. I have my sons.
And I remember, part of this, part of this, part of these people who were founded by other people who were fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I'm piti.
And just like a graffiti coast, the walls, the walls, I think, I'm a parkanels and Parkanlagen.
I use the gardens that the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the trees are my connections for these stuff.
They would be surprised what the earthquake, if you use it as a line.
You can't imagine how he's amazing a sunship is, and how they're people.
So what happened?
I've been experienced how my garden to an instrument for the relationship, and the fourth.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the ground.
We're the ground.
They'd like children, how children are going to be influenced.
Gardens is the therapistic and careful and citizens that you can do with the city.
And then you know, you know, you get earthquake.
I remember this time, when this mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was circaine, and I came out in my garden, and I came out.
I've been really bad, I've been really bad because they were there, and I said, "Wis are not going to do that.
The garden is not without reason for the street."
I've been looked at when I saw people who were so close to me, and I was so closed me to do that, and that's what I said, "Fin, you know, you don't ask me, you don't have a fear."
And I said, "There, no, no, I have no anxiety that they don't know what they're doing.
And it's not to street.
That's the idea.
I want to take it, but I want to take them back to me, I want to take her health."
At the other time I lived a garden in this observed in Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow.
These are the guys who have helped me to device the laster.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it's affective, and how they've been able to see her mother and her grandmother, and it was great, and it was great for a moment.
Green reason has been prediction of about 20 garden.
And we started our environments, and they got so 50 people and they were all freewilling with freedom.
If kids carbon carbon carbon dioxide.
If they were eating them, they eather.
But if they're not going to get out of it, if they don't get anything, how food and body, and body, and body, and you're blind, and you're always eating them.
I see young people who want to work, but they want to stick up in this thing -- I see -- I see that thing -- I see that's exactly the paths that are going to be able to look at the path.
The gardens, I see when I see a opportunity, where we can train themselves to care their communities to care their communities to lead after life.
And if we do that, who know who?
We could take the next opportunity of Washington Carvernment.
But if we change the collaboration of the earthquake, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole walking on garden powerful plants in the same bottom of the same bubblish.
I want to take schiffscontainer, and they use in healthy Caf."
So you don't understand me.
I'm not talking about cost-cost-cost-cost-cost-cost.
The comicated is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about people who are working, and children, and children from the streets, and they're going to leave the streets, and you're going to be building your own food, and if you're buildings.
So what I want to do is to do is this.
I want to say that we all have ecological rebelling, Gangster, Gangster.
We need to be the picture of gangsters.
If you don't have a garden is not a gangster.
Gangster you're going to sell you?
And let's the waffected the choice.
If you want to make meeting meeting meeting meeting meeting in push meeting and a meting and a meting, where you want to talk about what you're talking about it.
If you want to make meet you want to get your selly, you can put in my garden, so we can get any sort of possible.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite songs in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No,"
Although, although in 19th century, a better distance, "It's a better drawing, "It's someone who's a stranger, independent on a parents, and its parents, and his region, and his region, and his regularly.
I have no idea what "spoke,"
Somewhat with words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians that they need to control the language.
For example, for example, third, the British Parlament, the British Parlike World World World.
And that was actually going back to the mother's going back to the Mutual name of a man whole named Brass Crosby, who's brass Crosby,
She was him in the Tower of London and he was a muthority, but he was a mutigrant enough, he was so much enough, and he was so much difference, he was so much difference in London that he was so much difference in London.
And only a few years later, we find the first next message for the first message of the first message, like Brass"
Brassed on the English word for book.
But that's not true. It's going back to a prediction.
But to show you how World and politics and politics, I want to take you to the United States, when they're going to get the unprected.
You saw the question about how to call George Washington, the state of the state of the state of the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leadership of a republic nation?
And that's been in the Congress in the Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible for predictable.
I mean, some people wanted to call him, and I called Hovernorge Washington, and others, and others, and other, and other, and other, the freedom of the United States of America Washington.
Not so that's not a conversation.
Some people wanted to call him a simple king.
They thought that was awhiled.
They were not even monarchistic, they wanted to be the king of time,
It would have function.
But everyone was unbelieved, because these distrible because these during 3 weeks.
I've got the days of a senator who's still same thing: "Immmmerging issue.
The reason for the reason for the long time, and the representation was that the representative.
The representation is not going to do that what's going to do was not going to do. They wanted to do it.
Could call it, and they call it, and they're still going to be able to get to the next.
They wanted to him, they wanted to give youngest, you're the most vision that they give them a little bit.
This guy was "President."
President. They don't have the title. He's existed. But he was existed, but he was suffering that someone.
So something like the prediction of a Jury.
He had no longer than the size of "Ancement," or "Anter" or "Anced.
Sometimes, there were powerful little grandchildren, and governments, but it was a really unmanning, but it was an unmembers.
That's why the senatures.
They said, "That's smile, you can't call it pits.
This countries have to write appears and out of the countries.
Who is going to take it took it, when he's a dumbles like President of the United States?"
And also, after three weeks, the senating.
Instead of the money, you know, the title of the money, but they wanted to use the middle of the middle of the middle of their own powerful respects of their own repects.
You can learning about three interesting things.
First, I think that's what I find out, I've been able to find out whether the senatures, the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just a guy. He was just because he was just because he was going to be able to do that the senates.
Secondly, you can learn that when a government says something temporary -- then you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Thirds, and that's really important point is the most important point is that the Titled States, the United States of America" of America" or not so much more clearly, right?
This has been a little more than 5,000 nuclearly, and the biggest volcular volcular volconomy of the world and a photte drone and this whole stuff.
And we've given the title of the size of the size.
And so the senat at the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end.
They have a respectables.
And the other sorry of the sense of the sense of equality -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound how the closely, like the 5,000 nuclearly 5,000 nuclearly.
So at the end of the senat and the representation, and the representation, because no one who feels like a whole thing that you're going to be the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take with the most important thing I'm going to do.
Politicians trying to use words to control the reality to control the reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, the reality of words, the reality of the reality.
Thank you.
So I came in a laster with about 50 rebelling a campaign for Differentalabad, a 19-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I thousands of my swareness carrying a pairs, and I could use a pairs, and they couldn't see a rockets that I couldn't see a rocket.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was a great big, I was big, all the pyjama Pyjama Partys and football plays and fights and the windows and rassists and religionalists and religionalists and religion.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to stand here, I've been brought, Southeists, Southeists, and atheist, and atheist, and atheist, and atheistan who's been working in Afghanistan, and created afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do a lot of great things that you couldn't make a personality, but I want to make a personality. I want to make the personality, and I want to find out of the personality and carbon directly and reports.
I want to spend a day in life of a dihad -- Gangster who spends his dihad -- the sound communists like <unk>Popstar Bling" and political created and political created and political corruption and political care.
And what's sunshad-Gangster than the Parlament to the Parlament and a choice and a choice with the slogan: "Whad, I'm going to do. I'm talking about it."
And trying to use these campaign to use these maybe these maybe as Nationalhelming.
I want to give them a corruption in Afghanistan, and they're going to take a project called "Ridge," and you're going to be a false of the wrong control.
I want to look at me, like the conflict in Afghanistanistanistan, I went to the "modic conflict.
The war and the war and the freezing answered with him, and they came up with a new environment, and Mode, and the models that you can only a models of skills of sky.
And I'd like to see how a simple simple simple simple characters of 18999, and it's a dialogue today about it today about it today is today's going to use their wures.
But for all of these things, you can get in the prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be miserable.
But I have to do it because I have to lose because I need to lose itself.
That's my favorite. Which is your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I worked as a model.
Since 10 years, right, right.
I have the feeling that now in the space of a space in the spanning, because I hadn't have this clothes.
Fortunately, I have something to change something to the way.
This is the first time that someone who's the first time on the TED-Bice, so you can't be happy to see that you can't be happy.
If you were really a few women were really explored when I got to say that now, you don't need to say that later, I'm going to twitter.
I also think that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very carefully 10 seconds, which you think about 10 seconds.
And it's not a chance.
This remains are very uncomfortable, it's good that I wanted to do it.
The most difficult part is to pullovered the pullovered my head, because then you'll just get me out of my head, so you're nothing about my head.
In order.
Why did I do that now?
That was personally.
Now, it wasn't hopefully as this image.
One is a powerful, but a powerful.
I just have just changed your mind. I've changed in 6 seconds.
And on this image -- I had never really never really never been a friend.
I felt very unfortunately, and the photographics, I said, and I said, and I felt like this guy, and I fill this guy.
And by the surgery or the wrong bridge I was wrong brunch of the work that I've been very few opportunities, there's only change our <unk>uite possibilities, and our farms, although it's another, and influence -- a bighborh.
To being able to be honest for me today.
And I'm going to stage because I'm a model.
I'm going to stage because I'm a high school, because I'm a woman who called a sexy Mirl.
I'm going to ask the questions that people who are always standing, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means "Oh," but that means.
The real reason why I was a model is a mathematical lothers and maybe you're going to ask you to ask you to ask you're going to ask you took this exploration.
Now, in the last few years, we have a centuries, we have symetrically defined and symetrically defined, we're biological programmed, but also finished, and highly, and highly highly highly.
This explained me for me. And it's a result of paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Small. Liuan Small."
And the first thing I'm going to be your model-work. Some. Some.
But I have to give you to tell you that in 2007, a very experienced Doctorand of the NYU all the models on the launched every single one that has been booked by 67 or not only 27 or not only 27 or not only 27 or not only four percent.
The next question that's always been allowed me, "Can I'm a model, if I'm a model?"
And I said, "I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls really like to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be.
You can be president of the U.S., or the United States or the next Internet or a ninja-Dicherzchurg-Dicher, because then you would be greatest, because then you would be greatest."
If they're still saying, "No, no, no, no, no, I want to say, "No," I say, "Who's saying, "Who's my cow."
Because I have no responsibility for nothing, and you might be the Chefred the American vogue or the business or the next sense of H<unk>amp;M or the next sky.
And you say that you're going to be a model is, you'd say that you'd say that you want to win the Jackpotto.
You can't be able to be able to be fantastic and it's not a map.
Now, I want to show you 10 years ago, I want to knowledge, because of the monstrate, because else can only do it, it's just going to be able to do it.
If there's a photograph, and you're going to be able to be able to be able to say, "Cameron, and you want to go back to the photo in the long, and then you're going to go down to the legs, and then this is the both, this is going to beautiful, this is the arm.
It looks like this.
Hopefully more comic than that in the middle.
That was .... I don't know what's happened.
If you look at the school, and you've done a few jobs, you can't say that you can't say that you can't say that you're going to be a lot of the United States, but in the United States, "10 years," you're going to looking at the world.
The next question that's the next question is, "Who are all photos.
And yes, so pretty much photos are all the photos, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is all the first photo, and that I've done that I had a bit of all the first time I had a bikiniode. I hadn't even my periode.
I know that's pretty personally personally, but I was a young girl.
So I just looked at a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm at the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is a pyjama Pyjama Party, a few days ago, a shooting for the French vogue.
This is me, I'm going to the Football and in the V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not a pictures.
They're constructs, and it's construction of profession of profession, from Have and Make-up-up-up-up-up-ups and stylists and the public production.
Okay, when you ask me, people always wondering, "What are you going to do things?"
Yes, I have been able too many 20-cm-common that I could never metabolics that I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it, but the things I'm going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went to a day, and I had a launched my money, and you gave me the clothes.
As a teenager, I went to my friends, and she was a flying, and they were a red launched a red launched a red launched. It took a choice, and we could do, and we could get out of the wall.
I have this cost of my costs of my personality, and I don't know why I don't know, and there are people who don't know white a highly personality of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and they were filtered, and they were 85 percent swars and Latinos and latinos and most of men.
It's live in New York only 17,000 young men and latinos, and latinos, "Who's not the question?"
And so, "How often, I'm going to be? When I'm going to be?
And I found my rights for this talk about this talk about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-old girls in the United States. And these numbers. And these numbers. And these numbers.
The last question is, "How is, "How is it, a model?"
And I think they expect them, they expect this answer: "If you're a little bit of harm and glense, you feel sense, you feel happy and fabul and fabulous and fabulous and fabulous."
And Backstage, we're going to give you a answer that event.
We say, "It's really greative, so much to be greative, and it's greative people, inspired people."
All right, but it's just the only one half of the half of the story, because what we never said, "I've never saying, "I feel like, "I feel like, "I feel like, I feel like to say, "I feel like,"
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think about my exception.
And if you ask you ever ask, "Would I be happy when I was happy when I was going to be happy?"
And then you should make a few mathy, because they've got the darkest legs, and the most districts and the most cool cool and they're the cool cool, and they're the most important women on the planet.
When I was a very difficult to tell me, it's very difficult to care a real bit of a picture, because a lot of a sits, because one of them, I felt very unfortunately, and saying, "I'm going to be my grandchildren who had been in my grandch."
It was very difficult to be a very difficult to relate away from unfortunately, if I'm going to opening a bigger nutrients.
But I'm also happy, and I'm going to stand here, and I've been able to do it, and I've been able to do it, I've been able to do it, and my career, and my career, because I'd saying, because I wouldn't even know how told I'm not going to see my boy.
If you look like this talk about this talk, then you hope that we all have the power of the power of the immediately, and the mistakes and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've been forget the words, I never forget that's been coming in the exiliences in the Exily Gaddafi Widge.
But who never never been like a gaddafi revolutionary revolutionary."
There's almost two years, since, since the liby's been broken revolution of the waves of the waves of the waves of the massive, and in the egyptical revolution.
I spent a lot of other libyers, in many other country, and outside and outside the corns and a type of the corns and to tyrannyrannyrannyric Revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Junge, liby, liby and men and men in the first rest running the end of the regimes, himes, hold slogans, the freedom, and social generality in the air.
They have an example, they've been used to provided by the brutal dictature Gaddafised Gaddafised.
They have a strong sense of sense of sense of the Midary Oast, until the west, until the South.
And finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 tagged us to start to start to strong our country and the Tyrane.
But Gaddafi has a big box, a big branne, a guyrannei, the corruption and the reason for course.
Over four decades has gaddafis tyrannic regime, the infrastructure, as well as well, and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The desertification and the challenge and the challenges, I women, I women, how many other women's civil society lybia, and we've been able to do with a certainly surveillance.
And so, 200 organizations were during and unmed and unmediately, and unmed Statefishing in Benghazi.
After three years in the exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasm, I started to the themen I started to the themen capacity, human education, human education and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women and women, I women, I women, a women, a movement of women, leaderships, and it's public life that's public.
And so, I met a very difficulty, I met a very difficult environment, a polarized, which is always a polarized by the egoistic politics of the egoistic politics.
I was a slightly, and I was a companies, and I women and women and women and women and election, a laws, a laws, a laws, which is a laws.
On the end of our initiative about our initiative about.
Women women 17,5 percent of the Nation of the first choice in the first choice.
But long, but the euphories, the euphories and the whole revolution, and the whole revolution, we thought about new new news of violence.
A morning a morning about changes of money, and Sufi-called Mozi-Gral.
One morning a morning news about the murdership on the American bothers and the message.
One of the morning the morning of officients of the poor.
And really, we're grow up the heart of the milize of the milize of the milize of the people's missing their power and their power and their power.
Our society, against a revolutionary minds, polarized, polarized by the ideal and Principles and principles, social Germany, social generality,
Intolerance, exploration, and Rache and Rachewing the Iconents of the revolution.
I'm not there today today with the successful inspired by the success story of our redes and the choice.
So I'm a lot of today today is that we've been wrong choice and the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We've been wrong our priorities.
Because the choice, the choice stability or sure of sure, or sure.
Hat the relike the relike the white and the women and the women and men and men and national visional visional values?
No, she doesn't.
What's it?
Why is going to be our society is polarized and dominated by self-soubled and the dominance and the dominance, and the exploring, and the women?
Maybe the women't the only thing that has not the only thing that the female wealth, but the female, the gnade and the gnade and the gnade.
Our society needs a national dialogue, and consumer, and consumer than they've booked on the end of the end of the polarization and decade.
Our society needs the qualitative connection of the weible more than they need more than they need to be a female,
We need to hear that we need to have to stop and a day of the roach of the roach.
We need to start in the name of the middle of the gnade.
We need to develop a female discurs that wouldn't just following waiting, but also too, but also together, the regular roaching, collaboration, collaboration, a conclusion.
These are the ideal that I've been a voice lybia, to make peacebia to make peace to make peace.
Because the peace has a alchemic and in this alchemics, it's about the femines and maskulin sight.
This is the real rediscious reluss.
And we need to do that, we need to do it before we do it before we do it.
After after a vision of the Coran "Salam" -- Fried "ist the word of the word "Sal God."
The word "Anowledge," and that's going to be known asked," and it's the same Arabic wurtled "Mom," and symbolized the word "Mommbolized the whole female.
And just like the motherleible the embryo, which is the embryoard, completely the reason while the entirely emotion of the entire existence.
And so, this is why said, "My Gnade all the things."
And so, this is why said, "My Gnade said, "My Grandful."
Maybe all the gunst of the gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country, and I wanted to best with the long "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were looking at the story of climate Iland, but we learned, but we're going to learn that America, South America, South America, our fine.
Where I was often asked me, I thought, I thought I was, I thought I was, I thought I would spend my life in North Korea, until now.
With they saw years, I saw a public headed a public he thought, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to live.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter of the year, from the sister of a college.
And they were stood: "If you're going to be here, our families are not going to be able to be able to have been for two weeks.
We're going together and our body and our body is soon as body as body."
I was so highly so highly.
I heard about it, I heard that people in my country in my country.
So just took me on the bottom of the bottom, and I saw something that I couldn't get anymore.
One live in the bottom woman, and a board, and a painting child in their arm, in their mother.
But no one has never been half of them because all of themselves, because allowed to care their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big characters in North Korea.
At the end of the end of North Koreaner's fallinger, and many more than a lot of far more than just because they're just because they're just because they're just because they're outside.
Stromes were always been holds, so that's always been since all the light of China on the light of China on the other side of China on the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side.
I always wonder why they had no lights, and we didn't.
This is a satellites of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the river, the river, the Amrocorea, the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river, the river, and it's very important and he's going to be able to do the river.
But many satters.
Sometimes I saw Leich, I saw.
I can't say much about how I can't say that I can say, but I can say that I can say that I can tell you that I could turn out to China.
I thought that I thought I was a short time of my family.
I never thought that it's 14 years together, together.
In China was very hard to live when young girls without family.
I had no idea of what the life as the life as the life as a north Korean flying. But I wasn't just extremely hard to be very difficult, but also, but also, but also, but also, because it's very difficult.
So I lived in standing in strong, I could fear that my reality, and you'd be a bad send to North Korea.
One day, one day, my greatest optraum, when I was bigger than I was biggered by the police, and in the police.
Somebody who was important to be north Korean, so they test my chinese and asked my chinese and asked me.
I had this anxiety, I thought I thought I thought.
Would anything eventually, I couldn't get to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I thought it was to control my life, I felt the questions.
After they were asking them with the exception, said, "That was a rules.
It's not a North Korean."
And they love to go. It was a wonder.
Some North Koreaner in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and down.
This girls had girls had great.
Although they were expect, they were expectly finally finally free international pressure.
This north Koreanerins didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, unfold north corean in China, and after North Korea, where they're followed, where they're going to be highly history.
Although I had a lot of my river, I was happiness, it's not so much other north Korean.
It's tragic that North Koreaner, and hard to survival, and hard to survival.
After they've learned a new language and works, their world in a moment, their heads in a moment.
After 10 years of the hidden, I decided to South Korea, and I started to go back to South Korea.
Mich in South Korea, I never had a bigger challenge, when I thought it was a bigger.
English was in South Korea is so important that I had to learning my third language.
Audement, I have the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all the coreans, but inside, we've been very expecting us, we've been in the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the text.
Idention through a identity.
If I'm South Koreaner?
Where's what I'm going to do?
Suddenly, there was no land more, there was no lands more,
Although I had the anpassive life, I had not easy lives, I had a plane.
I'm going to ready for the attention of the university.
I'm going to be a new life when I was a new life, I was a bad, I'd have a bad.
The north Korean board, the money I started to my family, and as a street, and as a streets, and as a streets, and it's above the country.
They had to fast as possible, so I started to plan.
North Koreaner have to be an incredible strecking on their way.
It's almost impossible to the gang between North Korea, Ironically, Ironically went back to China and I was a plane, and I was going to China and I was going to China.
Because my family doesn't have to literally, I had to sitting on more than 2,000 miles through China and then after South Asia.
The busyclists, and week, and we were more mentioned more mentioned.
Once, when the business, a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the expect of all the experience, and they started asking questions.
And I thought I didn't understood, I thought I thought they'd being.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided to decided to him, and he said that they were taking her turns out their attention.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, but happy.
We had to create it to the limited, but I had to farmers, but I had to bordership to bordership.
But even thought we had the bordership, my family inhabited, because of illegal bordership.
After I had goney, and smaller and smiled, my family in my family in a months. But I was in the city, but I was in the main city, I was in the mainstadian.
That was one of the biggest rid of my life.
I had done to family to family to free to free, and we were so close to family, but my family, just my family.
I went down and I went through the inside of the police and the police, and tried to police, and I had no enough money, but I hadn't enough money or graphy or graphy or graphy or graphy or graphy.
I lost all my hope.
And I said, "What's the voice is, "What's lowing?"
I was completely surprised that a free that there's a free.
In fact, in English and I was book, I went through a womatching my situation and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two family and two family and two family and two more northern.
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why do you?"
"I don't help you," he said, "I'm going to do this.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The most popularly popularly symbolized for me to me, and he needed to do the North Korean, and he showed me the friendly, and he showed me the free friends and the freezing community of the community as the hope.
And finally, after our long government, and I was my family, but I'm going to long, but the freedom.
Many north Koreanered by their families, and so as soon as they get in a new country, they're not going to get a little bit of money.
The international community can help us to help us to the English, the education and many mountain and many mountain.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea, because many of us in contact with families, and we're still in contact with family, and we send to change the hold, and we're helping them to change the hard.
I had a lucky, so much helpful and inspired to get in my life, I hopeful northern Earth's successful international success.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful north Korean, also on the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've just a bit.
I don't say you're not tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good.
He can't talk about, but he's communicated firew up a kind of the best rather than there.
Remi white, what love is.
He's particularly expecting, and he's inequalent.
He's not gone. He's not going to the skin.
He's not approaches not to religious university, and you're just before you've never tells you.
If he remembers of our childhood, in the words, I'm not even remember, I remember a thing: how little bit about a slightly, and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16th is big. He's very good.
He's a absolutely uncomfortable memory.
But he also has a soul.
He can't remember whether he had my songs, but he remember, but he reminded, but he remembers of any city, he was able to my iPod, as he was four, as he was four, when he was four of the most public four,
Do they don't hear about it?
But many people don't true.
And in fact, because their understood because their society of normal version of normal pasters, and they're often.
But what my heart, and my heart, and my soul, although that was that, although that was the case, even though they were not just a violum, that it was just a bigger, that they were able to be autism, and autism, and autism.
Now, for the ones that you're not so that doesn't trust the moment with the brain is a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brains that are social communication, and sometimes the skills.
It's also extraordinary, Individuum is Remium is Remi is so different than Sam.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person Autism, and although there's one of the most fastest growing evolution of the world, there's no holding or hold or holes.
And I can't remember the first time I remember when I'm autism, but I can't remember, I can remember.
I was borning three years old, when my born, and I was born, and I was so excited that I had a new words in my life.
And after a few months was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and actually, and actually, and actually, and it's not very interested in me.
Remiff and regular world, and he was in his own world, and he found my own rules, and he found the little thing that's like about how to make a series in a series in a room, and whatever it's all about what it all.
And when he was older, he was different, and the differences were set up.
But behind the wood and the wood and the Frust and the nevertheless, and the hyperactivity was a range, and unique, and unique, a boy who had ever saw a boy who had ever saw a human, who had never been a human, who had never been a human,
And also, incredible.
Now, I can't afford to find out there was somewhere in my family moments in my family, Moments I wished that I wished that they were just like I'd be exactly like I'd believe that they were.
But I'm going to go back to the thoughts that they've leaded me to the idea of individuality, communication and love, and love that this is what I'm not going to be able to do.
Normality about beauty, the beauty, the differences, and the fact that we're not differently, that we're not thinking that one of us.
It means that there's a different kind of rather than it's a different kind of rather than it's a different kind of portray.
And if I could just say a thing to Sam and saying to Sam and to you, and then you're not going to be normal.
You know, you know, you're an extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a business. And we have a business. And in all else, and in all ears, and in all the streets of potential.
The chance to the size of the scale and walls and walls in the moment where we're trying to be in the other.
Please -- you don't say that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgal remote with ears and neuroscience, and neuroscience on a projectile, and with a million single power of a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million times, and see the world, and see the world, but one million pictures, but a billion images per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography photography, a new a new a new a new apply new apply, that they can actually make them so fast that they can make them in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the absolutely to look at education or without a <unk>-ray in our body, and we can actually stand up in our body, and really, "Kamera,"
If I'm going to take a laser, and I'm going to be a billionth of the seconds -- that's more female -- that's a package, I'm going to create a package, and this is a millimeter, and this project, and this project, this projectacter, and this projectaced this project
So if you take this project, this project, this photones, and it's going to take this fibers, how are going to breaking these photones in the fibers?
How does it look like light?
So this whole events --
So you think about it, you think that's really less than a nanoseconderful than a nanoseconds -- so light, but I need to return this strecking -- but I'm going to make this video to the factor 10 billion of this video.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't finance.
So, in this movie, so much, so let me show you what happens to show you what's going on.
The pulse, our projectil, our project, we're going to move a photones, and that starts to move and the bright.
A part of the light, you're going to see outside the table, and you see this exercise.
Many of the photones, the last few years of the lastest past, and exploding the rivers.
As you can see, there's air, there's air.
While the during the waves are going to look at the table and while the reflexion of the reflexion of the reflexion of the end of the focus on the end of the focused on some images.
If you're going to take a projectile project, and it's the same strecks and the video, and the video, you know, you know, you know, you know, how long you have to see here?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very slow film -- from a long film -- from a long movement.
And how does it look like a little bit of a bit of pictures?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like if you put a piece of a piece.
I mean, it would be like this, as a photo mature, a photo matter, but of course, of course, of course, of course, of course.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that when you'll see that when the light, you're going to remain this light, and you're not going to remain.
Why is that? Because the tomate is the tomate is in their lights and after a few seconds.
So in the future when these future, if these femto-camera in your camera, it could be able to be able to be able to make it in a supermarkets, and if you're going to be able to stop.
So how did my teamera on MIT this camera?
So when you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you have a photographically, you have a very little billion light, but we've got a billion times more faster than your career than your career than your care.
So we're doing this: We send this projectil that projectil, this photones, and we're going to show you the very clever and repeated synchronization and these gigabytes of data, we've got to record this female.
And we can take all these rows and doing this rather and so interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Others can make us feelings can make us feel like a new south for a new south for a new southern soup of soup?
The idea is that we're going to street.
It's going to be able to go back to the room, a part of it will reflects, and we could reflect them back to the camera, and we could use these more simplifying these lights.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built.
Links, you can see our femto-camera.
Here's a puppeared, and we're going to leave the light.
After our advention in the "Natural competition in the "Nature Communication, it was published by Natural.communication.communication.
We're going to get this light, and they're going to get together, and they're going to get a little bit of packed in all directions, and some of the packages are going to be able to reached the lights that will reached the light, and then the trope.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our fast -- our femto-camera has a camera.
She's a very good time, and she can look at the world in light.
And then, of course, of course, but also the door, but also the door, but we don't know what we don't know what we know is, which we don't know what's heard.
Indeed a laser on the smell, we can take a rocket, how they can see a rocket, how they're not really seeing -- not really, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they're trying together, and they try together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit of practice, we can see that we can see the practice, we could see the cars, we can see the collisions, and we can see what's going to see, or we can see in the course of the course of the course of the light.
But because of the blood and violume is that, of course, and that's why it's a way to knowledge, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, there's a new picture of the next botography.
So, as you know, we can't have a scientists, and there's a scientists, and there's a artra-connection, and I realized that all these gigabytraphy, and I realized that all these gigabytes that we don't just knowledge.
But it's going on here.
If you look at this waves under the waves, you can see that the waves of us, you can see that the waves.
The waves should be moving to move.
What's going on here?
And it turned out that we're almost in light, because we've been able to take this picture, and an effects, and an incredible picture incredible.
The reportion, in the events in the events in the world, in the world, in the world in the world, so you can relationship, so you can relationships, so we can use these connection of space and time, we can get this confusion.
So, if we stopped to the photography, or the medical creating a new data, and we're going to start to the medicine or new data, we've been able to help us to the data and data and the data and the data and the data and the data and that we've been hope,
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many possibilities, how our lives.
We don't make any non-making, so that we don't have many ways of wisdoms. But we use the same public place.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighborhood and creatures like Atkleber, slones and circle.
The projects, how much mine my questions, how much matter how much message my neighborhood?
How can we stopping more things without using to stop?
How can we leave our memory of the buildings and the country and the country?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so that we share our communities, our communities and tears and tears?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea, the giant effective effective effective years, hundreds of years, beds, beds, beds and tears, I'm going to talk about a city, and I'm always a city,
I think any time, any time, if someone, there's no plane, there's a parade.
In this city is a few of the most beautiful buildings, but they're also the city of the world, they're also lose to the city.
I'm going to be able to remain this house, and I thought it's a little bit about something that I thought I was always changed my life.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved to be very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, and she was suddenly and unexpected.
I've talked about death, and I was a big death, and I spent a big disease, and it brought me to me now.
But it's hard to me, this sort of sight, every day.
It's easy to forgether, and to forgether, and to forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I've been able to leave a huge hope, and I wrote a huge, and I wrote a big device, "Bevorite, I want to be a piece." Everyone who's a piece of his carry.
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could experiment, but the next day, the next day, and they're always been filled.
I want to share some sentence with you, who were written by the wall.
"Bev before I want to be a piratterns, I want to be pirattern."
"Bevorite, I want to stand, I want to standing on the International datums."
"Bev before I want to singinging for million people."
"Bev before I want to song, I want to plant."
"Bev before I want to live, I want to live "nethan."
"Bev before I want to die, I want to holding them in my arms."
"Bevorite, I want to be someone who I want to be someone."
"Bev before I want to be song, I want to be myself."
This is after the prediction of a sense place, and the hopeful place, and the hope and the hope to the laughters, and I was going to kill me.
It's about knowing that you don't know anyone.
It's about our neighborhood and understanding and seconds, and in a new way.
It's about place for basically reminds and remind us to remember what we're most important to change what we're growing us.
I've done this last year, and I've done after the economics that he wanted to build a walls, and I wanted to build a walls, and I've been able to build a countries like arrived in Lustries like artana, Africa, Africa, Africa, Afr
We've been showing how much public place our public place, when we have the opportunity, our voices.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever before, the things that are important than ever thinking about the right both the real life is that the life is that the life is that the life.
We're often going to talk about death to talk about death the death, but I've just thinking about it, but I realized that the idea that the death is one of the death.
The idea of deaths to the death of death.
Our common summarian place shows what we're doing us as a community, and as a community, and with more possibilities, and stories, and stories can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us better places.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me with me with me with a particular problem for any problem for anyone who are considered mathematics, is that we're going to be as companies.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to tell you about today, I'm going to explain what I do.
Tances is one of the most activities.
We're going to be in the middle of most of mostly balletting balletting and same way you see the same way you can see.
At the ballet is a very big massive amount of colony, and abilities and abilities and abilities, and possible eventually a genetic connection that could have a genetic context.
Turological structured neurological stories like Parkinson's long-long skills, and that makes them to my repling, and that's what was a ball, to be a ball.
Over the years, you've done a lot of research for many restore.
Despite, there's a year, there's been 6,3 million people who live in this disease, and they need to live with the unexpected symptoms like symptoms, and more live, and more live.
We need to know if you can measure whether it's the only way to know if we can measure whether it's a reality, if we have a possibility, if we have answer that question that this question.
<unk>riminal is that there's no relationshipson and other movements don't have a biomarker, so there's no simple biombs. That's the best thing that there's this 20-Minutes.
You have to get him in the clinics. It's very expensive, and that means that means that's not going to be made, and it's never done.
But what if patients, if patients could make this test?
That would be a business tour in the hospital. What would be patients, what if patients?
It wouldn't be a teacher's personal hospersonal.
It costs <unk>,000, in the neurological appearance in the neurological approach.
And so I want to tell you a unconventional methods, we're trying to reach that we're all trying to find in a sense, because we all have senses like my recognitional Jan Stripling.
So here's a video of video of vibrate voice.
This is what happens when someone who's happened when someone who's going to look at the time. We can look at all, because we can look at all these voice, because we have to look at all these voice, and we have to make all the greatest, and we have to do.
And as Ballets, it's enormous amount of surveillance.
Think about how long a child, how long a child, until it.
And so we can receive the position of the vibrate stimmlipps. And as the grandmother, and as the voice of parkinson.
On the recording to the example of an example of unregular stimming voice.
We're always see the symptoms.
Stimply, swords, Steificity.
The language is going to be able to do this, and that's an example, and that's an example.
And this effects of the voice, you can be minimal, but sometimes, and sometimes, and President, and Prescentralysision, combined with new soules, combined with new large-like.
How can you measure this tests with clear? Well, they're both both of neurologists. The neurologists.
And infrastructure. The infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. There's not going to be the voice.
So you can be transformed by itself.
They're very quickly, you're maximal 30 seconds.
They're very billy, and we know what that means.
If something extremely billy, you can also in big massive.
This is amazing goals, we can now get to this.
We can reduce logistic characters.
Patients don't have to leadership in the clinics.
We can objective data, we can get through holding.
We can't get a circuitive massive studies, and we can get a smart and it's a until the population of the population of realization.
We have the possibility to look for the first time to look for the hospitality to look for the disease before it's before it's before it's possibility.
Today, we're going to do this direction, we started the parkinson's Parkinson's dimensive.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of voices, we want to take enough expanding enough exciting for the first place for the first play.
We have space that we have space that are the drivated by a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, or without parkinson, or without parkinson, to get a few center for a few center. I'm going to familiar with familiar with fix percent of our goal.
Thank you.
If you say, if you say,000 people say,000 people say, can you say, who's healthy, who's not?
What's the same thing?
What's happening is that the patient's going to be the person on parkinson't sorry or not. OK.
Some people don't get to the end of the end.
But we collective database, undergrounded by different circumstances, which is interesting. These circumstances, because we're there, because we're in order to figure out what are the real marker for parkinson.
For excited her 86 percent decades?
It's much better.
My sler thanasis -- I have to love it, because he's so fantastic worked -- now has given -- now he's also function, and it's working on the project that's what this project, and we're going to be able to believe in the 9 percent.
That's called a process.
That means that people can do -- the people can do with the handy on the cell phone, people could take the testing to take their voice, their voice, so that they can take their voice, so that you can put the rest of the disease.
Gen.
Thank you. Max Lady, my dams and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
So here's what I live in Kenyairobian Randia, I live in Kenyairobi-National parks.
In the background of my father and the cows of my father and the nairobi-National Park.
The Nairobi national park is just in the south, just in the south. That means that wildlife, that wildlife brased on the park.
The redes that are the solutions, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that was killed. I thought. I thought, and I found it was a great bad. It was our only bully.
My stamm who believed in the massai, we believe that we're going together with our animals, and the sky. That's why we got to our animals.
Should I learned to have a children.
Our warrior cure, you're using our struggledge and our country and our country, and we're brought this problem.
And they kill the solutions.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobians.
And I think there's a lot of the Nairobi- National Parkin.
In my voice is a boy between six years, and nine years, and nine years, and it was also a box.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Few. Lions. Lions for the fire.
But then I realized that this wasn't really help us to help us to see the solution, but the cows,
But I didn't do it. I was doing.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to a vogel.
I wanted to think that the solutions, I thought I was stage.
But solutions are very clearly clear.
They come up, you see the vogels, and you go back. Beimself. But they're going to move, and they're still there.
And they're going to killed our viety.
One night, I watched the stall. I love with a fackel in the hand around him and that's not going to him.
Lions for a light for a light that's moving.
I had an idea.
Shone as little boy worked on my room, I used took the day in my room, and I took the new Radio of my mother roadio of my mother. But I had a lot about it. But I had a lot about it.
I took a cars an old carry and a role of a motorrad. The right, and you're right or lower or links or links. He's blind.
And I said to me a switch to a switch and out of lights.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a caps.
And then I built everything.
The solar panels the battery, the battery, the battery stricity of the direction. I call it a transformator.
And the direction.
You can see that the births, because of the outside there, because of the solutions.
And so this is what it looks like that, if they come up.
The lights blinks and the solutions, I think I'm going to believe that I was the time in the time in the bed.
Thank you.
I've been installed installed and since we had no problems, we had no problems.
And then we heard our neighborhood.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had many of their animals, and she was lost their animals, and she could ask me whether I could installing.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
Since I've been seven houses in the neighborhood and they're really good.
My idea is now going to be used in all the cenycle, even for other running or Leopards, or Leopards. The lights. The lights.
My supporting to a stip to a stipendium on a stipe in Kenya, Brookhouse in Kenya, and I'm really excited.
My new school, and I'm going to help and helps and holding and reclaration.
I've even my friends with my friends, and we've been used together, and I'm not going to show you where there are no, and I'm not used to show them how to use them.
A year ago, I just a boy from the Savanne, who was high school. I saw Flying me and said, "Eines day, I'm going to sit on me."
And here's what I call.
I thought, I thought to airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a great, I want to be airplane and pilot. That's my great dream.
Fridge I've got the solutions, but through my invention, I can save the cows, and we can save the solutions, we can live without the solutions, without side, without stripe, without street.
Ash<unk>n. In my language. In my language: I'm very much.
You know, you know, you know how you hear it's like you're hearing your story like your story.
So you've got this stip. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list?
My number one, I'm working, I'm working on a electrical caunch of electrical caune?
Yes, I know, electrical cases are already have been invented my own, but I want to have my own.
You've been tried to get a trying to try to do, I'm trying to get the trying to get the trying to get a book, but I got ...
All of the beginning is hard Turder, you're a little bit of best.
We're going to be able to do your way, you're going to start my friend.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Since I'm old enough to hold in the hand, is photography, but I want to share with you today with you 15 of my favorite, and no one of my favorite.
There was no kind of director, no picture, no chance to picture, no chance. Not even the picture.
In fact, the most of the most of the most of the mostly,
My story story begins when I was a talking about a talking about this image, and my wife, and my wife, and I was my first birthday on my poverty half the first time. We were on my arm.
And so, we were later, we were in New York and so we decided to same picture, we're going to get a little picture.
Now, you can see what you can see, you can see,
When the thirday, when my daughter, my wife, "Hey, why you don't you sabina, "Hey, and I'm not going to New York and make it a father?
And then we started to make a picture of tourists, a please of us.
You know, it's remarkable, how universal, if you're in a completely fully free.
Nobody said no one has said no to the lucky is also never done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much of our lives.
This journey is very hold.
This one is just a weeks after the 11th, and I had to explain what happens to understand what happens to understand that a five-old it.
These images are much more than just a founder than just a particular moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a possibility for a week for a weeks and how we're going to change our time and how we change our time, not just physical, not just physical, but in all.
Because even though we're always changes, changes our perspective of Mal. While they're always new military to see the life with their eyes with their eyes.
These very intense very intense we're going to spend with each year that we're expecting every year.
Last, as one of our records, we went through, we went through, and place, and place them like it shows how they're going to show you how to put them on a red launched markets, and they love to love to love to love to love.
And she told me about their feelings that they had as a five-olds that they had been able to be exactly the same.
She said they remember it, as they remember the heart of the breast, when they saw the first time they saw the first time.
And now she looked in New York, because they're in New York, because they want to study.
And I realized, I realized, the most important thing we all created,
And so I want to share with you to share with you, a active role in the memory of memory.
I don't know how it looks like you look like this one of these 15 pictures, I'm going to families.
I'm always the picture.
I want to get any of you today today with you today within the image, and you don't you ever ask someone education?"
Thank you.
