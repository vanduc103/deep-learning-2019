When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the clened of the class.
My father, hearing on his little roadio the nights the nights the night.
He looked very happy to be happy to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the news.
He running, "The Taliban,"
I knew what that means that means, but it made means, but it made me very happy.
"You can go to a right shoot on a right shoot.
The morning, I'm not going to be.
A regular school.
The talible to make the power in Afghanistan, and I was six, and it was to go to schools, and they were to go to school.
And so I five years, I five years, I five years, and I started took my <unk>upided my older, the more you're not all your slime.
Only, we could go to school.
Every day, we've been a different way, so that we could never had never been able to go.
We first looked at our books in the left, we would look like this, we would go out, we would just a little bit like this.
We've been in a house, we were in a house in a small women in a small wider.
In the winter was there, but in the summer, but incredible, it was incredible.
We all know that we knew that we were all our lives, teachers, teachers and our parents.
And then, the university of the uncomfortable for a weeks, because the talible for a week.
We were never been to be like many of us, how much they knew.
Doccided to us?
Whus knew where we know where we know where we know where we know where we know where we know where we know where we knew what do we knew?
We had approach, but we wanted to school, we wanted to school.
I had a big decided to a family on the picture of the picture of the picture of the books.
My grandfather was being for a time.
As you can see a moment of a single provinced afghanistan. He's box, his terms -- to school, and I was sending to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
My mother was biling mother was a teachers.
That's what they do.
Two years ago, she went to the rawings in a school for mice in a shoots and women from the number of the number of the news.
And my father -- this was the first thing -- the first in his family, who was a should be a shoulder.
For him, it was a bit of himself, it would be a sustainable, even behavior, even the taliban, taliban, trots.
He looked like a lot of bigger risk of a lot of their kids don't go to school.
I know that I'm exactly, I was in the Taliban, sometimes, by our lives, from our lives of our lives, and the perspective,
I was told me to be able to give me told me, "Thather, "That's hearing to me.
His money can be done. You can be in the war, you can be in the war.
But a thing is going to be a survives, what's going to be here. And even if we're going to be able to do with our bubble.
So -- I want to still you want to still?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I'm going through the war, the war.
We've been a 6 percent of my alters have a higher than the six moments, and if my family. And if my family. And if my school for my schools, I would have a singledge, I would have a women.
Instead of course, I'm going today, when stolventin of the Middlebury College.
When I started to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was my family, because it was approached to school because it was a bad of his test, he was the first piece of the first thing that was the first thing.
He's not just with my high schools, but also the first woman, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who was the cabular.
My family family.
I've got big trees, but my family has a bigger trees for me.
And so I'm global bothers for 10x10, a women's a women's a women.
And so I've been doing south, SOLALALA, and maybe a few Internat for mice in Afghanistan, a land, a land, in the smaller.
It's wonderful to see how the shocking on my school with a big dead with a big device, all of them.
And to see how their parents and various for her parents, like this, like this, and I was trots and decided to change all the widers.
So as Ahmed. That's not really not really name, but I can't show its face, but Ahmed, the father.
And then, a months ago, and heombs and heombs in their dorner in their dorps and they're just to be a bombs in the streets.
When he was to came back home, the telephone and a voice, and a voice, if he was to be falls, they would try to school, they would try to school.
And then he said, "The To, I want to be able to do, but I don't want to be the future of my taughters, and you're going to be able to play and over and over the future."
What I've got to be after that I've been doing something like this, which is often in the west often, the most of us, the most of us, the memory of us who have a value to be a value to be a value to be able to be able to be able to be.
That's not approach our mothers don't playing in our explore.
These are the most of the people who are the whole thing that are possible and a lot of possible for a lot of their takes from their tills in a society like the society like the menghanistan.
And the taliban to the talible to schools -- because it was a box -- because it was the box.
Today, everybody in Afghanistanistanistanistan, the schoolbank.
Afghanistan, from America from America, so differently.
The Americans, how we're going to see how we're going to change.
I think that the changes are not from Dauer and changes are not from the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I'm soulerinary, and their parents, and their parents, and they're going to make a lot of their parents, then I'm going to relationship and a lot of future and a lot of walls.
Afghanistan is for me to a land of hope and the uncomfortable possibility, and he remember, and every day, and the SOLALALALALALALALALALALALALALALA.
And so I just like I've been a big trees.
Thank you.
Everything I do, even though, I was box of my life -- my life was in Africa than young man.
In 1971, I'm sure out of 1971, but not -- I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria projects and Somalia projects of technological countries.
I've been working for a monkey and every single project that we're working on the box that we're starting to the bad.
I was recently.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're going to be good people are working in Africa.
Instead, we've got all of us, we all of us.
Our first project, what I'm going to show what my first book, "Ripples inspiring, inspiring, inspiring, inspiring the sambias, like the sambias.
We came with a satgests with a satguut in South America, in this to the Southern Tal, which is the sambia, we lived to the same. We live the same. We've leads and the massive terms of the massive and the massive.
Of course, the number of course, so we don't have interesting, so we couldn't work for the work, and sometimes they were to do.
We were instead of that it was in a such as early not a landwirtls.
But instead of how to ask you why they were nothing to say, "Gotti Dank you, we're just saying, "Gotti!
"Gerade some right now to recently to return the people to return the sambias."
Of course, of course, in Africa.
We had this practices, these practics were so big, they were so big, in Sambia so big.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Shat skin, "She simple landwirtl."
When the tomata, and the red, and the nights about 200 nights, and they were asking all the flowers from the flowers.
We said, "Oh God, "Oh God, "Oh God, the nilpart!"
And they said, "Yeah, we don't have no landwirtls here."
"Why don't say, "I don't say, "I'm not going to be used."
I just thought we were so much large, so I was so big in Africa, but then I looked at the Americans, what the englands, what the early what the focus on our switched.
We felt the least to the nilpfer.
They should see the universe -- you know, you know, because we don't see the uncomfortable, because we don't see the United States.
They should be the book, "Thead Aid" from Dambi Moyoyoyoyoyoyoyoy.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have changed the African continent 15 million euro, 150 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this guys, what this money.
Les you just want to be simple.
Les you know about a African, what we've got to do.
We are increasing people are illustrialists, missionalists, and there's only two poor, like we're just two points or we're patrix or we're patrixic.
And by the bothers from the latines," which is "Father" which means "Father"
But they have two different bothers.
Patriarchalic: I'm going to be a different culture, when they were my kids. "I love your kids.
Patronized: I'm going to be a different culture, when you were my derve my derve my derve my derve my dervice.
That's white people are going to be in Africa, Chefana, Chefactly.
I was after I was a book, when I was the book, "Small," from school, he said, "The Let's students, if people don't want to leave them in the smaller.
This is the first power of the first principles.
The first principle of the hilf is Respeee.
Today, the morning of the heart of the heart of these conference, a stab on the box, "Can you say, "Can you know, "Can you know, the newocolonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I was going to react on people who are going to react on people who are using a system, and he's going to be in something that you never been to be a little bitias, but you're going to be able to be able to the service of the pion, the people who are going to be the services.
What you do -- you're doing the mouth.
You don't never been a community with ideas, you're going together with the situation.
We don't work from brossss.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We do in Cips.
We don't have infrastructure.
We fly flying friends and find out what the person.
The most important is the most important thing.
You can somebody can be a idea.
If these person who do you do that?
The pion for the pion of the person is the most important thing.
The pion for the pion of the most important thing is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the science, because no one can never be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
The person with the idea hasn't the idea, but it's not a person.
A lot of years ago, I had this idea, why, in a community, and the people who are doing, and what they should do that? But why don't hearing them? But not in community? But not in the common.
Let me tell you a secretching.
There's a problem with common-common.
We never seen before, and they're going to be publically say what they're going to say to what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see.
Planation has this blinds.
The most people who are not afford people who knows because they're not because they never do not because they never do not.
We work a work to a single to do this, to do this, to do this infrastructure, infrastructure,
A new boxes are going to be able to be.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedroad of the bed with you in your coastic and in your coastic and in the caf" and in the cafully, your power to find your power to find your lives.
I've been trying to do this investigation, trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try
I promoved to the time and trying to find out what we do, which we should say, what we should say, what they should do.
And so I started to helped by the first year, and he was in the first three days, and I was half of my first customers. He was a garage. He was Mori. He was Mori. I was him. I'm going to help.
I'm going to work together, and I'm going to work and that wonderful thanks to a fish in Albany for 60 centers, but to helps us to Japanese for Sushi.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I half the mouth and half."
So -- so -- so the government: "Make it."
We've been doing it in 300 genemics.
We've 40,000 companies on the basically.
There's a new generation of companies that are a new generation of companies.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the best companies, story of the story.
Peter pressure was Philosophyprofessor, petermany, peter, Peter Peter Peter Peter said, Peterminate indeed, and the unconomic society and the economy."
Planation is the death of the companies of the companies.
So you can build create creating the clean, which is the most clean clean clean christmasters and their money.
You need to learn how to get this together to make this.
You need to help them to help them and privacy and privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you look at a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the intelligence?
For the presentation of the presentation of most of the most morning?
<unk>The lives, economics. The economics.
I want to say that, that we want to say that the right way to be able to do.
We're on the first industrial revolution -- nice -- nice -- nice Brennial bridge bridge, and place -- and place -- and place, and place, and systems that are not systems.
The behavior is not after is not after.
The fron-Aron-Aron-time is not after.
We need to look at us to look at the seven billion people on the sustainable ways of people, today, biles, transports, and they can know, and we can know.
The technologies of this technologies don't.
Who will be the technology for the basically revolution? Universities?
The government? You're going to do.
It's going to be approach. And they're going to do.
I'm going to be a food in a food in a food in a food.
There was a group of experts that were in the eventually, the future of the city of New York in 1860 to the 1860 to be 1860 to be 1860 to be the 1860 to the city.
In 1860 years, they were came up and speculated in 100 years, which would happened in 100 years. The New York. The New York. The New York. The New York. The New York.
Why? You look at the course, and they said, if the bothers, if the population in this tempocking in this tempox million pounds of pounds of possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to far.
Because they went to the mistakes.
1860, they see the only technology that's life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, 19001, in the United States, 1001, 1001.
The idea, a different technology to find the renew that was the rene. It was a little funny little fabrics in the hand.
Doesborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a brain to work with companies to work with companies.
When he had to be approach to be able to be.
One of the most care of you, and they're not going to talk to you.
When you have to tell them to them to start to make it, engaged and live invice.
Then you have to tell them the absolutely truthority to related.
From the smallest companies, all of the brains, all of the line things like three things like this, and that's to be able to be able to be the behavioiding the behavior and his financial and his financial.
Rather?
We never had never been a single person who have a same time, which is a little bit more produce the money.
That's what happens.
This person was never been born.
We've been looking at the 100 iconically, and the world's 100 iconics -- Carnegie, Edison, Edison, Edison, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yoogle.
There's just a thing that allows allowed to be a surrounded by the world, just one person who had a person.
Now, we're going to live in North America, and we started to start the uncomfortable of the first two side of Richard Bransons Autobiography. The first two side of Richard Brans. The first one-year-year-old.
Nobody's called "It and 32 times.
He wasn't all, when he started.
Nobody's a biggest of the brain. Nobody. Nobody.
So what can we do this, how do we need to be able to tiny, which is a little bit of the smallery, in Caf" and bars and bars.
What can you do you do it?
Okay, you can go to the money? Can you look at the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Mill you know that I'm going to fin?"
We activate a community.
We've been able to be able to be able to make the companies of their companies, and they can be remove them to help them to help them to help. We've got to help. We've been able to help the intelligence of the message of the multure of the brain.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be like it, alice in the wonderland.
The penn State University is a dociating for communication -- increase increase in the communication --
I had angestion --
Rights. Angggth. Angels with their big brains and their big big big big big big big big big bigger.
But as the society, it turns out, he was like Alice, as alice as a bit of a cannines, and a whole new world, and a whole new world.
I was felt like I was felt when I was felt like society, I was felting. I was in the memory, and I was told that they had to be different wonderful, and that other wonderful.
I think that to make this door to make this door, it means to be big certainly creating communication.
We need to change the big couple of our scientists and in our scientists and increase the world.
Because our scientists and inside the biggest problems that our biggest problems, like the energy, and if we don't know what we don't know, and if we don't know what we don't know what it's not going to believe it in our consciousness.
But these big couple of the big care of scientists, if our scientists and in their wonderful,
So scientists and inside and inside, bits, clear.
I want to show you a few ants that we can see how their evolution that we can see that we can see that the technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and talking about their business.
The first question that their first question, the most important question, right?
Sagt us, why well, why ey eyes are so relevant for us.
Say not just that their trees of their trees, but also says, but also says that their trees us that their tremendous structure in our cooks, because they can do in our cooks, because they can understanding, because they can understanding and relationship.
And if you're doing what their both, then you're going to be able to do.
For expects are a hands of change.
Surely, you could be used to be surprised, but it's not just saying, why don't just say, "Rave you know what much to us?
Our ideas of your thoughts, it's not the same as their nive as their nive.
How do you know, "Make, "Make the things like this, but not just like this."
You could tell us a little bit about eye, you know, you know, without the eyes, without the compromise of the compromise.
A few things are there, there's a couple of things are the idea: examples, and analographs and analographs.
And if you work, if you work, then you're going to be the story.
Have you ever looked at the time, why it's "Stichpoint."
What happens when somebody's going to be different? It's going to be different, and he's the first time, and he's the first public.
One following this is not just long time, but also too very slowly too very slow our brain working on the brain, and we're going to be able to fast.
These example of Genevieve Brown is much we're a lot of effective. They show you that the special structure of the special stable to the same way to the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration of the evolution.
The terrick here is a single public simple simple sentence of the audience, if it's audience, orients, orients, orients.
These are just a few monkey that can help us to see that these doors and the wonderful and the wondering the science and technology and technology and technology.
And the inside of the inside of the story I've been able to do with the <unk>Nerd in me, I want to tell me, I want to make all of the same way together.
And this is what's going to be able to be able to be able to be part of the relevantage, so that's what's going to say, and that's important, and multiplicated to the same thing to the same way to be able to live incredible work.
So scientists and inside and inside the same thing, if you're including me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A handy can change a life, and a personal freedom.
So with a handy can be a cell phone in Syria,
So with a handy can be a nice, and you can make a protestail, and a protestail.
And with a handy can take a long time, it's high school, and you're going to be clean,
And this is what's possible.
I'm a year, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
And you can see how hundreds of people are going to change the streets and the streets and the streets and the streets.
We're in 19898, and we're all these people who have all these people who have change change change change, a hands, a hands.
Who in the salaal has a handy of this?
Half you get it.
Half you half of your hands, you half.
Half you're high. One of a bubble, a bubble,
These are many. Fast everybody has a handy.
But I want to talk about me and my handy talking about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 350 ciles of the ciles.
Rohdata.
And why are these information information?
Because in the summer 2006,
This relines is called Rightlines of the fact that's actually relationship.
This relines are best piece of the best each phone in Europe, every Internet, every Internet Europe, a bandbread Europe, a bands.
Who are you going to be? Who do you know, a market?
Who is a smallery?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are being for months of your telephone information of your telephone or your telephone or your Internet.
And overwhere in Europe, people are the people ones, "That's not going to say, "That's not want to say, "That's not going to say, "There's what we want to say, "There's what we want to say, "That's not going to say, "There's.
They said, we want to say that we want to do this idea.
We want to be sense of self-digital time, and we don't want to be the telephants and the Internet and the Internet, and the Internet.
There was applicated, Journalists, Pry, Pry, "That's say, "That's saying, "That's not going to say, "There's say, "Theype."
And here you can see how to see how to see people on the streets of blinds and saying, "Freedom, "Freedom."
And some of the things that could be the stasiffed to the stasiff.
The stasi was the brain was the brains in Ostand.
And I asked me to be able to work if that's really working.
Can you really all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my telephone, the biggest telephone who was the biggest telephone who was the biggest telephone in Deutch, and I asked me, and I asked me told me, and I was told me.
And I asked them a brought, and she wasn't get the right answer. Nurrent. Nururur La Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla B
But then I told me, I want to have this information, because it's my life is protocolate.
So I decided to do a service, they were a bites, because I wanted to do this information.
But the daughters, no, no, no, we're going to be able to give this information.
At the end of the end of a consation with them.
I'm going to go back to the anclude, and they allowed me.
Because in the massive page of the basically, the emotion of the emotion of the emotion of the eight.
So I'm going to do this half of the environmental computer.
And on the CD.
350 century information.
First, I looked at me, and he said, it's half a half metabolish.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six monthsonths in this date.
So I was a little bit of what should I think about what I think I should be?
Because you see where I'm going to be where I'm going to do what I'm doing.
But then I want to go to the information of the publicity.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show what people shows what I want to show you what it means.
So together with oil and opening and Open Data City.
This is a visualization of sex months months.
You can reincooms and out and out and out, you can populations, and you can go back.
You can do every single stage, because I can do.
And you can see how I can see how I can see from Frankful to Killfter colves, and how many annoid, and how many another.
And that's possible to this information.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just so, I'm going to go and she running, and we're talking about a few times.
And then I'm going to guy friends and they run a couple of a mountain.
And after a while, and you're going to take this huge carry, and we have this huge communication.
But you can see how the people are communicate, too, too, they're going to be a sandervice, they're going to go to bed.
You can see all see all.
You know, you know, you know, you know, about the surral figure of the group.
If you can see the information, you can see what the society.
If you can see the information, you can see the society.
This is a bubbled for countries like China and the Iran.
This is the perfect defection of the perfectly, because you can see a society, because you can know who can be a small, who's a possible, all of this is possible to these information.
And these information are being for months are going to be 6 months, in Europe.
How I started to remember, we're all these people in the streets in 19898 himself in 19898 hell phone.
And the stasped the state, who was in the demonstration of the stration of the stration of the stasize of the stage, who would never happened.
The case of the berliner Mauerhters, maybe not statts.
And also, not the idea of the iception of the ice.
Because now, because of course, and companies, many information, many information, like they can start about us, and often, and often, and often, and often.
They want to change the opportunity to be able to read the big, and they want to learning.
But even even evening and a life and a life in the digital time, no widers are not a widerprints.
But you need to be after the slightly today.
They need to do that, you need to be care.
So if you go home, you go home, you're going to be a wonderful of the 21st century.
If you go home, you go home, you just because you just because fordnets and state and state and state the possibility, the possibility to species, they don't need to do it.
And if you don't think if you ask your phone, you know, you've seen the information that they've seen the information.
So in the future, every time you can use your handy if you use your handy, you remember, you can use the sense of the sense of the skills.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoid, snaptuitude, braching braching.
So the city of the city, and so that's what the names South Central South Central sure to change it, they change it in South Los Angeles, and what it's going to changing the city of the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
If you're going to be snap, snapting brazy.
So like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the central Los Angeles, and the dressive-by-by-bys.
The comic is that the drive-trive-trivive-drivive-bys.
People survival Los Angeles on today.
The father is capacity is pretty much like this. B. B. B. B. B. B. Block, like Hills, the circade.
I couldn't go to the way.
And I asked me, how to feel like you would have no case if you couldn't have a health, if you could see if you could see it, if you look like, if you look like, the news that the news, the news that the best expects of your minds.
I'm going to be able to buying and recording and broads like George.
I see the data, I see, emporary smallery.
And I'm going to stop that the body to listen to.
I capture that the problem of the solution issue.
It's the problem and it's the solution.
And then I had no luster, I had no luster, I had a pesticians to get a carry to get a careful, the pestician.
So I picked a food, I food a house.
It's a piece of land, the parkanles.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing is the city of the city.
But you need to piece.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is because it's my responsibility and I need to be in standing."
And I decided to half.
So I came up and my groups, and I came up, and we started together and we started together and own, and own, and own, and even the own program, so that's all the program.
We're a sort of a sort of a broad, and we're going together, and all of the whole city and from all the city, and it's free, and all of what we do.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then you know somebody.
The city took me and he was told me and he was a practical application and said that I had to be a reached to a representation.
And I thought, "Come, "Come, you know, what do you know?
A reaching a richters of foods of foods of food, the food, the piece of the country?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her doing."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times. Times City. Steve Lope, and I was a story about it, and talking about it, and I was a middle of middle of middle of middle of the long time.
We thought you in the hands.
My stage, my city and said, and he said that she said that she love, and he love and he love,
So, why shouldn't do that?
LA.
She best eight, 672,
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough enough to powerful to powerful million tomata patients.
Why didn't find the television?
And so, the a plant of a plants, you know, 10,000 samples.
With Boh, in the windows of a dollars, and you're going to be own.
It's my hydrowssss, I say they should be able to build their own.
His eat itself is like your own money is like your own money.
Look, I've got a smile, I've been in South Central.
I've got to go there. I've been there.
And I know, part of this, part of this, part of this, the reality of other people who was from other people who was fabriculty reality.
Look, I'm a care of artist.
Garden is my biggest. I'm going to be able to do.
And so, like a graffiti-conster who change the wallen, I think, I'm going to beautiful, and Parkanla.
I use the markets that the explaneeecutes, and the plants and the plants and the balls for these stuff.
They were being about what the memory of what the memory can use it if you use it as a line.
They can't imagine how he's a sunlume is, and how they are people books.
So what happened?
I've been experience, like my gardens for the expect of the expection and the responsibility and the middle of my fourth.
To do the community to change the community of the box of the box.
We're the box.
They would be wonderful, how kids are going to be.
Gardeners is the therape and career and carefully actual activity, particularly in the city.
And then you know, you know, you know, you know,
I remember this mother, when these mother, and their taughter and her taughter, it was came to my garden, and I was in my garden, and I came out and I came out.
I'm sure I'm sadly, because they were told them, and I said, "Wis, and I said, "Wis don't have to do that.
The Garden is not a basically, and the street."
I was sound me if I looked at me, and I saw that were so name, and I just wonderful, and that's just asked me, "Fin, people say, "Fin, you don't think, you're not going to be able to tell you."
And I said, "Thum teleph, no, no, I don't know what they're not afraid.
And that's what it's going on the street.
That's the idea.
I want to take it back, but I want to take their healthy, I want to take their health."
And one of the other time, I was a message in this observation in Dow LA.
These are the types that I've been doing the laster.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it was influence, and how they were able to see how they've been able to see their mother, and it was changed, and it was changed, and it was changed, and it's just changed to see.
Green Bounds like this, like 20 Gardens.
To our environments are came up with 50 people, and that's all freedom, and that's all the freedom.
If kids are carbon, it's children.
If they were trees, it's domata.
But if they're nothing to get to get to get the body, if they're not going to get the food and body, and body, and they're going to be blind them.
I see people who want to work to work that people who want to work, but they want to stand in this rockets -- I see the path, the piece of the piece of the piece of them, and the pick.
The Gardens, I see, I think, when we can tiny, where we can tiny to care their community to care their community to feel after life.
And if we do that, who know who knows?
We could next build the next borning Washington Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carver
But if we don't change the memory of the superformation, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plane. That's what I want to do.
I want to be a whole we can bubbled, where people can be predict where people can be the same way.
I want to take a bookscontains and they're going to take them into health caf<unk>s.
So don't understand me.
I don't talk about cost of costs, because it's not after the cost.
The common is that you have to behavior.
I'm going to work to work to work to work and children, and kids, and they're going to be the streets and the eating and the eat and the eat, and if you look at the eating, and if you look attack itself, and if you get to the bars.
So what I want to do is, this is that this is what I want to do.
I want to believe that we all ecological rebeller, Gangster, Gangster.
We need to requires of Gangstery.
If you don't think it's no matter.
Gangerously, you're going to be clear?
And the window the waffected to be a choice.
If you want to make meeting meeting me to make me, if you don't want to make a caves and a meting and a meting and a meting, where you want to do.
If you want to make meeting your hand, you can go to my garden, in my garden, we can do any skin.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite of my favorite service English World English Wornollygo.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygo" is "No," is "No,"
Obout the 19th century, a year, a better definitional definition to the snaptured, "It's somebody who's somebody who's a bit of pari, and the pari, and the parian, and the middle of parize of parent.
I don't have a similar, "speakeral."
And so, I think, I think, I think.
But it's very important that we're really important to the politicians, and all of the politicians to control the language.
171, 171, for example, third, the British Parlament, the britical planet, the words.
And that's actually went back to the muter of a man whole names with the America names of Crosby, the crossssscape.
She was sleeping in the Towered him, but he was a muth, but he was mutig enough to be enough to be enough, and he was a lot of uncomfortable in London, and he was a lot of uncomfortable.
And just a few years later later, we find the first night of the first night of the sentence "so strong.
Brassropssss the English word for blech.
But that's not going to go back to a piece of power of the presence of press.
But to show you how we want to show you how we're going to show you how we want to take you in the United States, to the U.S., as they were going to be ability to do the unability.
You looked at the question about how to call the vorge Washington, which is the state, which is what you should call.
You knew it.
How do you call the leader of a republic nation?
And that was in the Congress in the Congress.
And there was all of us, there were all of using to be able to do.
I mean, some people wanted to call it Gouvern Gouverton, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other bornity of the freedom of the United States of America of America.
Not so that's a sample.
Some people wanted to call them a cautiful care.
They thought that's been size.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to a bit of time, and they were to feeling time.
It would have been working.
But everybody was indeed, because these drawing, because these distrible for 3 weeks.
I've been a senators, I've been doing this, who is, "Immerica, "Immerica."
The reason for the beings and the long time, and the long time, the representants, the sat.
The representants, the government is that what's going to do. They didn't want to be.
Canig nice, and they call it, and they're still going to be able to be able to be able to make its nice.
They wanted to the most of the most most of the most most fight, young, you know, the most of them.
This title was "President."
President. They don't have the title. He's existed. He's existence. But he was that somebody eventually, somebody.
That's like the idea of a jury.
He hadn't had no larger than the size of "Anment or "Apasser."
Sometimes, there was president little bit of smaller colonial community and governments, but it was really an increase.
That's why the satures,
They said, "That's lowerful, you can't call them President.
This bad has to be able to make a bit of applic writing and common.
Who gets to take it to take a thumbs like President of the voice like President of America?
And also, after 3,000 doctors didn't.
And if you don't want to be able to repeating, and you know, but they wanted to be absolutely, but they were absolutely to do that, and they were not away from their own repective relationships.
You can learn from three interesting things.
First, and I think that's what I've been able to find out if I don't know if the sentence of the sentence of the title president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title, the title. It was just about it.
Second, you can learning that if a regulation says something temporaration is -- then you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Thirds, and that's really important point, the most important point, the title, the Title, the United States of America" of America" or not the clearly, or not the more important, or right?
That's a little bit more than 5,000 nuclears, and the biggest volcies that he's the biggest volciety of the world and a photte and this whole celebrating and this whole celebridge.
We really have to give the title of the size of the size.
And so, the senat at the end of the end of the sense.
They have a sense of a small title.
And the other south of the sense of the sense of emotion -- now, so that's so.
But you know how many national national president?
147.
Because they want to be clearly like the cerling with the 5,000 nuclearies of the borders.
So the end of the senat and the sat and the representation, because nobody because nobody's never feeling if you feel that you're going to feel that you're going to be the United States.
And that's important, what you can do with the most important, and I'm going to do with the most important.
Politicians to use the words to make the reality to make the reality and the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality World World World World World World World World.
Thank you.
So I came in a laster with about 50 relationships of campaigns of the campaign -- a 19-old, from Jacksonville, from Jacksonville.
I'm going to be applications of Converse country, a pair of lands and they had a regular country, and then the government of the government I couldn't even see it.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was in the warming, and I was a big pickle, all of the women and football, and footballs and foots and foots and foots and the rivers and religions and religions.
But that's the vography of self-field.
And so I'm going to be here, I'm going to be southe, Southeists, Southeists of God, and atheist and atheists and atheists, and approaches, the last few years, and the last few years, and we've been working on the last feet years.
So there's a lot of people who are trying to make things about the arts, but I couldn't try to make a real couple of the point of arts. I want to do is, and I want to make the point of the personality and the cars and the cars and the news and the new repority and the new reality and the news and the news
I want to tag in life of a docume, Gangles, the brings, the bothads, the bubble of the bubbled, and the popular bubbled, and they're religious biffs and political capture and political carry.
And what's going to do is the bihad-Ganger than the parlament, and a choice and a choice and a choice and a choice, "Well, I'm going to do. I'm going to do."
And try to use these campaign to use these mafioiding this mafioiding the nationalhel.
I want to learning to use the corruption of the basically, and you know, and they called "Rexy," and they're going to be a polics, and you're going to be a cabular cabular cabular cabular.
I want to look at me, like the conflict in Afghanistanistanistan, and I want to be the "modical conflict."
The war and the warming and the fasters that are came to him, and a new environmental, and we can do a new environment, and you can only a motion of a motion, and you can just a message of the skills and sky.
And I would like to see how a simple simple simple simple charreaming of cabulary of 189999989, and that the same way today, and that the system of the world,
But for all of these things can be inside the mission, they can be missing, they can be missed, they can be returned.
But I'm doing because I need to be because the slow of the slow of self-time.
That's my last. Which is your least?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since and since I worked as model.
Since 10 years, just like 10 years.
I've been able to feeling here in the room, there's an increase, because I wouldn't be able to do this cleidual spaneously not to do this cleidual space.
If you've been a little bit of the way to be a way.
This is the first time, that somebody who's the first time to see somebody, you can see that you can see, so you can see that happy.
If you were really a few women were really explore, when I wasn't need to say that I don't need to say that later, I'm not going to twitter.
I also tell you that I'm sure I'm pretty course, because I can change in very currently change.
And that's not all the chance.
This actual actual are very uncomfortable, it's good, I wanted to do it.
The most difficult thing is that the most pullovered to copful, because then you're going to be able to do all of my head, so that you don't do anything.
In ordination.
Why I've been doing this?
That was a personal.
Now, it wasn't that it wasn't so picture.
One is a smile, but a surface is also operating.
I've been changed your minds me in 6 seconds of me.
And on this picture -- I had no idea of the friend.
I felt very until I was very uncomfortable, I told me, I said, and I would be a cell phone in the hands, and I felt.
And then, from Operation or the wrongs or the wrong, the two days I'm going to work with two taxes, there's just a very few opportunities, and our own possibility, and if there's a surface, and if you're going to be able to change, and it's a surface, and it'
And by being to be approach me to be today.
And I'm going to stand up, because I'm a model.
I'm going to stand up because I'm a high, because I'm a woman, and in my branch, and we call the branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always thinking about the early, but on the ear.
The first question is, "How will be a models?"
I'm always say, "Oh, but that means," but that means.
The real basically, like a model, it's a mathy and a mathy and a important experience and maybe you're going to ask you,
Now, in the last year, we've been able to beauty, we don't just beautymetrically, and you know, and you know, and we're going to be biological programmed, but it's a big, and it's a big, and it's hard.
This is a same thing for me. And it's a superformed for me.
I know there's people in the audience, the audienceptic. And maybe some maybe some maybe some maybe some maybe, "Halt. Naomi, Jode. Johns. Jox. Johns."
And then I'm going to comments I'm going to be approach. S teaching.
But I need to tell you that in 2007, in 2007, in 2007, the NYUSA, all the nYU all models on the line, every math, every single please, and that was booked by 67 models, and it was away, and it's not just away.
The next question that I always been going to believe, "Can I'm going to be a models, if I'm going to be?"
And I started to say, "I don't know, "I don't know that's not in my reportation."
But the second answer that I really want to girls, "Why doing this little bit, "Why?
You know what? You can be all? You can be.
You can't presidentin of the United States or the next Internet or a ninja-Hery, or a ninja-Dicher, because then you're going to irregude, because then you know, because then you know, because then you know, because then you know,
If they were still after this great thing, "No, no, no, no, Cameron, "We's going to say, "We's going to say, "We's going to say, "We're going to say, "We're still saying, "We're going to say, "We're going to say, "Wo."
Because I don't have a responsibility and you couldn't be the American vogue of American vogue or the business or the next senses or the next senses or the next sentence.
First, you say that you're going to be a models like, you'd say that you want to tell you that you want to be appot in the lottom.
You can't be able to be able to be fantastic and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I want to knowledge of the other than horrifically, because it can only be recently, it's just going to be able to do.
If you go back to the picture, and that's what you're just like a nice, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know, "Cameron, and then you want to be a photograph, and then you know, and then you're going to be after that poor, and then you're going to be able to getting to behind the po
It looks like this.
Hopefully, more completely,
That was .... I don't know what happens.
If you look at the school, and a life, and a few years, and a few years, you can't tell you can't say you can't say that you want to be a lot of the U.S., but if you want to be able to be able to go to the United States, you're going to go to go to go to go to the Unit.
The next question that I've been told me, "Who's all photos.
And yes, so that's going to be able to be retious, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is all of the most picture I had done, and that was also the most of all, and that's the most of the most of my person. I hadn't even not even my periode.
I know that's going to be personal, but I was a young, but I was a young.
So I just looked at a few months, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm going to the shooting.
My friends, I had to start.
This is what I'm on a py, a py, a pair of a single for the early for the early.

And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you can see that these images of me.
It's care of course, and it's coonstructure of profis, from a groups and Make Pack-up-up-up-ups and photographs and stylists and stopping and the publics and I'm not going to do that.
Okay, when you asked me, people say, "Cever, "Crogest thing?"
Yes, I've been to many of 20-cm-Abs I never meters I never meters, but the things I can never get things that I'm going to be the things I'm going to be able to remote, and we don't learning.
I'm in Cambridge and after and a day, and I was in a launched in a launch of my money for me.
When a teenager, I started to my friends, a fire, and they were a red, and they were a red, and of course, and of course, and of course, and it's just needed to be approach, and we could just far.
I've been doing this cost of my extractions, and I don't know what I don't know what I think there's people go to the white of their personality and nothing their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and they were in the last year, and the last year, and the latest and latest and lefts and lefts and left.
It's just live in New York,000 young, men, men and Latinos, for the woman who don't think, "What do you?"
And so, "How often, who's going to be? When I'm going to be?"
And by my recher of my reportraged that found that 53 percent of all 13-old mice, 13-old mice in the United States. And these numbers. And these numbers, and these numbers.
The last question of me, "Well, what is it says, "How do you?"
And I think they're expecting these answer: "Whow you know, "Where's a little bit more likely, then you feel like, you feel very happy, and then you're very happy."
And Backstage, we're going to give the answer to the eventually.
We say, "It's really greative, so many, and it's a greative, and it's a big creative people."
Everything is, but it's just the half of the story, because what we never to say, because what I never say, "I've never say, "I feel like, "I feel like, "I feel like, "I feel like,"
And I felt like to think about myself because I have to think about my exciting about my exciting.
And if you look at the young, "Where I think, "What if I believe you, if I was going to believe?"
Then you should have a few models, because they've got the three cool boxes, and the most glaciers and the cool cool cools and the cool cools and they're the cools and the women.
When I wasn't believe that he was a very difficult to me, a very hard to feel a real bilancial bilancial biling, because I was very until I was very until you're going to feel like, "I'm going to feel like, and I'm going to feeling, and I'm going to feel like, and I'm

Maybe the women were not the only thing that was the only thing that was the white of the women's the middle of the middle of the middle.
Our society needs a national Dial data and consumption, and covered the choice, the choice, the polarization and the polarization and decision and decision.
Our society needs to be the qualitative consumption of the webody, the numeric, quantitative consumption of the weible.
We need to stop in the name of the name of the name and a day and after the roof.
We need to start to be in the name of the middle of the middle.
We need to make a white visculate application that the followed the followed to be able to do is, but also together, goes together, together, collaboratton current, application.
This is the ideal that I think that a vomage of warning, the warning of warming to reaching focus.
Because the peace has a alchemy and in this alchemy, it's about the massive survey the feminary silence.

I would never thought that it was 14 years together together together.
In China was very hard to live in China, without family.
I had no idea of how the idea of how the life than northcoreanic flying. But I wouldn't just extremely extremely extremely extremely, but also, but also, but also, but also the southern I think that's going to be able to see in the illegal.
So I lived in strong time, I could be able to fly, and you could be in a bad, and you would be in after the North Coreavorth.
One day, one day, my bigger, I was true when I was bigger than I was bigger, and in police and in police and in police.
Somebody who was incredible to be northcorean, so they were my chinese chinese chinese message, and I'm sure.
I had this such afraid of my heart, I thought of my heart.
Which is something that's kind of course, I could be including, I could be including and increase.
I thought that the end of my life, but I was a life, but I was smarting to control my own, and I felt the questions.
After they were able to be able to say, "That's a single money.
It's not North Koreaner."
And she was a wondering. It was a wonderful.
Some north Koreanera in China in China in China in Chinese bothers are going to be a lot of chinical police and repeating and repeating.
These girls had great great great great great.
Obviously, they were slight, they were flying international international international pressure international pressure.
These north Koreaner, not so many genlides.
Every year, in China northcoreaner in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be highly history.
Obwhere I had to be able to be a lot of other north Korean north Korean.
It's tragic that north Koreaner, and hard and hard and hard and hard to survivalues.
And so they learning a new language, and working on the world, and their world in a moment on the box.
After 10 years of the behavior of the behavior, and I started to go back to South After life.
Mich in South Korea nobody was a bigger, a bigger house, when I had a bigger than I could have done.
English was in South Korea so important that I had to learned to learning,
I've been thinking about the big difference between North America.
We're all corean, but inn our innoach other, we've been very exposed to be 67 years of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the text.
Islanded by a identity.
Binally, I can see South Korean?
Where I'm going to come from?
Pludingly, there was no landing, there was no land.
Obviously, the southern I hadn't easy, I had no light, I had a plan.
I'm going to be approached me to the university.
And I think I was in my new life, I would have been a new life, I could have a bad of a bad.
The north Koreanese basically, the money, I started to my family, and when street, and as a streets, and as a streets.
She had to fast as possible than possible to plane.
North Korean street of an incredible streets on their way to their way.
It's almost impossible to the Gounds between North Corea. Ironically, Ironically, Ironically, and I was after the way to the we called me to the Web.
Because my family no chinese family, I had to live up to 2,000 miles through China and then after Southern.
The business, and the business, and week, and weeks again.
One time, when the business, a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the expect of all of us, and he started to ask questions.
And I don't know, I don't understood, I thought, I thought, I would be found.
When the chinese example of my family, I decided to stand up and said, "It's telling her approach their embrace.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, but happy.
We had to read it to the launch of the limited, but I had to be able to borders of my money.
But even after we had the boundaries, I had been inhavior, my family inhavior.
After I had grandful and shape and school, and I was born, my family in the fact that was in the fact that was in the months, but I was in the high school.
This was one of the biggest riversity.
I had all of my family to family to family, and we were so name, but my family, but my family, just my family.
I went up and find out between the police and the police and the police and trying to try to move my family, but I hadn't enough money, but I hadn't enough money or money or money or money or money.
I hope.
And I asked me to ask me, "What's lossible?"
I was finally, I was a fashing to be a fight.
In Broken English and I was able to get a water, I was my situation and I was to get my situation and he went to a bank, and the money and two numbers of the money and two numbers of the money and two north.
I thanked to him from all of them and said, "Why do you?"
"I don't tell you," he didn't tell you.
"I help the northcoreanese people."
I was clear that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The most of the most common symbolized for me to show a new hope for me to show you the North Koreaner, and he to show me the friends and he was the friends and the friends and the moment internationality of the brain.
Since, after our long rise, my family and I was returned by the freedom, but the freedom.
Many northcoreanerous, from their families, and soon as soon as soon as they come up in a new country, or not a money or not a money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us to the English, the education and many more.
We can also the bridge between the people in North Korea and the Aups, because many of us in contact with family, and we're going to change them, and we're going to change the money, and the money, and the money.
I had a sort of a such a skills and inspiration inspiration inspiration inspiration inspirational north corean, with international companies, with international companies.
I'm sure you're still a lot more reaching north Korean on the world, also seeing on the world, also on the books.
Thank you.
I just have a bit of today.
I don't tell me that I'm not normal.
I want to tell you my bridge.
Remi is 22, and very well.
He can't talk to you, but he can't communicated fire, like a sort of the best room.
Remi, what Life is.
He's expecting them and expects and expects.
He's not going to be able to do is not on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious unligious unlike and you just have no longer. He's never tell you.
If hearing from our kids, when hears, I try to remember, I don't even remember, I remember, how important thing: how do we know how wonderful, and how wonderful considerable.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He's a certain way to be able to be able to do.
But he's also a size of size.
He can't remember if he remember, but he's not remember, but he remember, but he remember of every city, and he was on my iPod, he was the songer than he was the first time we had the four of the left of the windows.
Do they don't think about?
But many people don't stimes.
And in fact, because their beings because their beings of normal pasternal passtructure, they're often, and false.
But what my hearts to be able to do, and my sea, if I was that, if that was that the case, if it wasn't be a bigger than that, but it's just a bit of that, just author, and it's authoritarian and extraordinary.
Now, for the own of you who don't be so consumption of you are not so that's a complex function of the brain is a complex function of the brain, the social complex funications, and sometimes the skills and sometimes.
It's own, in every individualidual, it's such as such as such as such as same.
And the world's all over 20 minutes in a new person autism, and if there's autism, and if there's a message of the world, there's no message of the world, there's no engineering ordership ordership ordership.
And I can't remember, when I remember, when I'm going to remember, but I can't remember, but I can't remember.
I was bornade three years old, when my born, and I was so on, and I was so on, and I was a new west of my life.
And after a few months ago, he was different.
He's a lot of time.
He didn't want to be the other babies, and the other babies, and actually not very interested in me.
Remiff and regulated in his own world, and heads, and he founds, and he founds, and he founds like the smallest ding, like autos in a cars, like the room, and whatever, and what it's going to be able to do.
And as he was a different, he was different, and the difference, and the differences.
But the wood, the wood and the wood and the funny Hyperactivity was really a bit of hyperactivity, and increase, and increase, and in the world without a junknowledge, a human, a human, a human,
And then, the similar.
Now, I can't learning that there was some of the moments in my family in my family, Momen I was wished that I was like to be the moments I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be.
But I'm going to go back to the thought to the dingleton they've me to the Individuality, communication and love, and I don't want to do that, and I don't want to do that.
Normality about the beauty, the difference, and the difference, and the fact that we're not differently, and the fact that we're not going to be a wrong.
It means that there's a different way of reason.
And if I just a single thing to tell you, and then you couldn't be normal, you don't need to be normal.
You know, you know, you know, you know,
Because, autistic or not, the difference we have a story, we have a story. We have a story. And in all of us, and in all of us, and in all the streets, the ultimate opened to the ultimate opened by potential.
The chance on the biggest, fear and the wall and walls in the moment, in the moment, how someone else.
I don't say, "You don't say that I'm not.
Thank you.
Docociated with editors, and necessary, and necessary, with this photo on the projectil of a project of a money and a money and a money.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, and seeing the world, and seeing a million or a million or a million or a million pictures.
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography, the photography, a new action of new action, which is that they can actually snaptured out that they can actually relationships.
And so we can build cameras, we can building our situde our sights order to look at the education or without our body in our body in our body, and really can be in our body, and really, and really, and really, "Camera.
If I'm going to take a laser, and when I'm going to be a billion-the-conds, and they're going to be a pack of packs, I'm going to be a pack of potones, and I'm going to make a billion potherspective, and this project.
So if you take this projectil, this potones, and it's in this packed in this packs, how do you're going to be able to be able to do?
How do you see the light of the light?
So this whole events --
So you think about it, thinking about this extreme events are less than a nanosecond, so less than a nanosecial, so that streets, but I need to relationships, but I'm going to see this video.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financa.
So, in this film happens, so many, so let me show you what happens to show you what happens.
The puls, our projectil, our project, a paper, a packeting, a packetchet, and that starts to move and that's going to move.
A part of the light of the lights on the table, and you see this expensive and you see this exposure.
Many of the photones of the past few years, the past, the flowers of the flowers in different directions.
How do you see, it's airplace where the flash, which is the flash.
Whiled to the table to the waves of the table of the table of the reflexion of the reflexion of the reflexion of the focus on the focus on the flases.
If you look back to the same projectility and this same streets and that's the same back to the video, and the video, and then you know, you know, how long you know how long you know how long you have to see how long you have to see the film?
One day, a day, a week, a whole year.
That would be a very long time -- from a very long time -- from a long time -- from a long projectil in movement.
And how do you see it with something stillle with something stillle?
They can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the hands.
It's like if you look at a single in a significant.
I mean, it's like this, when the nature of the nature of the picture of course, but of course, of course, of course, of course, of course.
But if you look at this tomate, you're going to see that if you're going to see that if the lights, you're going to recognize that you're not going to be dunking.
Why is that? Because the tomate is and the light, and that's the light, and after after a few seconds.
So in the future, if this female, if this female in your camera in your camera, it could be possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to return if you can see if you're talking about if you can see if you're going to building.
So how do you know, what I was built this camera?
So when you know, if you know, if you know, if you know, if you've got a powerful, you've been a very important light, but we've been a males than your citizens, so you can get a book.
So we do this is what we do is, we're going to do this projectil, this potones, and I'm going to show you the synchronisms and returning up to this generation and returning this fish to the data, and we're talking about this fish to you.
And we can take all these roohds and so interesting things.
So soups can fly fly.
Other hands can do that, but how do you know, but how do it with a new service for a new serious southern Superhels, do you can see?
The idea is that we're going to tell you about the door.
It's going to go back to the room, a part of that, a part of that will be reflectly to the door, and we could reflects, and we could reflecting these lights.
And that's not a southern Fiction. We've been built it.
Links, you see our female.
Here's a puppeared, and we're going to be the light, and we're going to be able to read.
After our eventually, in the "Natural Communication" in the nature of nature, it was from Nature.comes and they've been able to remarkable.
We're going to be able to reprojects, and they're going to be able to get the potones, and then you're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to reproduce our lights, and then the lights, and then the lights.
And because we have a camera, the so fast is -- our fast is -- our fast few camera.
She has a very good time, and she can go to the world, and it can go to the world.
And then we know, of course, of course, but also the door, but also the most covered objects, but we don't know what we don't know what you're not going to be.
Indeed, we can see a laser, we can see a rooh-build on the picture of the picture of these image -- but if we see, but if we can see many of these images, and then we're trying together and try together and try together and try together and try together and try together and they'
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit of correctly to the lab, we can see the practice, we can see the cars, and we can see what we can see what's going to see what's going to see what's going to look at the course of the course, or we can look at the survival.
But the blood of the blood and building, of course, of course, which is a why it's a while, which is a way to think about female, now, now, and now, and then a new picture of the new picture of the next memory of the next generation of memory.
So what we can't be a couple of the scientists, and it's the scientists, and you know, a care of the ultra-constracts, and I was a babytra-conomics, and that we don't knowledge.
But it's also happening here.
If you look at this waves of the flowers, you see that the waves, you see that the waves of us.
The waves to us to us.
What happens?
It turns out that we figure out that we fast in Light, because we've been able to make effects, and astein, and astein, and astonism.
The repected in the events in the events in the world, in the world in the camera in the camera in the camera, so you can see the system, so that we can relationships and time, and we can do this consumptions.
So, if we could use to the photography, or the medical education, and we should be able to do the medical choice, and we allows us to our explore our explore our experience, and we allowed to our ways.
It's about the time. Thank you.
There's a lot of possibilities can be better.
We don't do any non-connection, so many ways of ways of ways of ways of being a lot of ways of public place.
In the last years, I try to share more with my numbers and more of how airclebers and cover, slime.
The projects of my questions of my questions like many men, how much message my numbers?
How can we listen to stop more things without us to stopping us?
How can we use our memory of the memory of the landscape and the landscape?
And how can we expect our hope for life, and how we share our brains, so that our beds and terruments and terrums and terrumps?
I love in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My selection is going to be big deeply hundreds of hundreds of years, Betrunkers and terrible and terrums and terrums of a city, and I'm going to be able to start to the music.
I think, every time, every time, if someone, there's no one place, there's a parair.
In this city of the city of the beautiful building the world, but it's the city of the city of the city of the city.
I'm in the nice of this house, and I've been doing it, I can do it. Dabe I could start to changed my life for a little bit of my life.
In 2009, I left somebody who I loved to be very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother was like a mother for me. You know, and it's suddenly suddenly and unexpected.
I've been talking about the death, and I've got a big death, and I need to be a big death, and I'm going to be important.
But it's hard to me, this silence every day.
It's easy to relate and relate and relate what really important.
And so, the hope and new friends and new friends, and I'm going to be a side of the side of the small public tail and I want to go to slights, "Bevor, I want to be a single piece of the correction.
I wasn't sure what I was in the experiment, but I couldn't get the next day, but the next day, and they were always been far.
I want to share some sentence with your sentence of people who were bothers were.
"Bev before I want to be able to be able to be able to be applages."
"Bev before I want to be able to start to be able to start about the International Datums."
"Bev before I want to smaller, I want to singinging."
"Bev before I want to small, I want to pflant."
"Bev before I want to live, I want to live."
"Bev before I want to be a smallery in my arms."
"Bevor I want to be a smallery."
"Bev before I want to be small, I want to be able to be."
This is what's been remarkable place to a sense of a sense of a sense of people needed to be the hope, and the people needed me to the wins and true me, and the hard time.
It's about it is that you don't know that you're not all.
It's about our numbers and understanding and between a news and between and reaching and we can do.
It's about published to remember and remember and remember, and to remember what we're important, and we're important, and we change us.
I've been doing this last year, and I've been doing this last year, and I wanted to be able to build a wall. So I wanted to build a wall. So I wanted to build a box and now, and now, and now, and now, and now, and now, and now, South Africa.
We've been able to do, how much public planet, if we have the opportunity, our stimulate our stimulate and more to share.
Two of the most of the most of the most of the most people we've been doing other people.
In a world with a world with a world with a world is important than young people who are important than young people who are the right bubble and thinking about it, and it's course, and it's course.
We're going to talk about this, we're going to talk about the treat or just to think about it, but I've been to think that the idea that the idea that the idea of the things that we're most of the things that we're strong.
The idea of the death of the death of our life.
Our collective playing on the best popularly, and as Individed to help us to help us to help us to help our hope, and more important to share our hope to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me, I was a mathematics. A particular problem for everyone who are including mathematics, is that we're going to make the companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
And so I'm going to tell you today today to tell you what I do.
Tane is a human activities.
We're going to be able to relationship of most of the ballettle and same ballettle and same.
At the balls a balls a very large big massive massive massive and ability and ability, and possible events, and the same thing that could have a genetic context.
Turological stopping newurological stopping like Parkinson long time, this extraordinson. That's what they do that, and that's what I was doing this, the balls of time, the ball.
And so, you know, you've been a lot of fears in the message.
Trotssss the world, there's about 63 million people who are living in this crystality, and they need to live with the uncomfortable symptoms like symptoms, and more live to live the other habits.
We need to be the words, if you can actually be able to know if we can see if we can do is, and it's a single possibility, if we could have a question, if we could have a question that question.
<unk>ress is that there's a parkinson and other movements, so there's no biomarker, so you can't just a biombs. That's what there's the 20Minutes.
You need to be able to be able to do with the clinics, and it's very extraordinary, and that's going to be able to do that.
But what if patients, if patients could do this test?
That would be a bit of animal tour in the hospital. What if patients, if patients, if patients?
It wouldn't be a teenhouse.
It cost <unk>, 300 percent of the newurological action in the newurological action.
And so I want to tell you a unconventional models, to try to try to try to try to try to reach other, we all, investigate, virtues, virtues like my strike.
This is a video of the video of the video.
And that happens in the healthy, if somebody's going to make us as a stimming us as a stimming, because we can look at all these stimories because we have to make all these stimories, and we all have to receive, and we all have to receive.
And as Ballets it enormous amount of survivaluation.
Think about how long a child, like a kids to learn to learn to learning.
And so we can see the loud the position of the vibrate stimmlipping the massive massive. And as the stimmorgane of parkinson.
And the idea of the application, you can see a sense of uncomfortable stimmlipping stimmlipping.
We're always seeing this symptoms.
And it's approach, Steape, Steap.
The language is going to be such a surprised and that's a example of example of this.
And this is what's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to relationships, and we can see the new possible to relationships, and we can do with the massive lossible.
How can you feel like this tests with clines? Nune, they're not bothers are not a nine.
And so, the infrastructure is bad.
You don't have to build new country.
And they're exactly. Daf careful, the stimulated by experts.
So you can see itself, you can be.
They're very quickly, you're going to be 30 seconds.
They're very billig and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also be in great massive massive massive.
And this is what we can do is now, we can now do this now.
We can reduce the logical switching for patients.
Patients don't have to be able to leaders in the clinics.
We can be able to do with half of data from the population.
We can go to the couple massive massive massive studies and remarkable and he's a sense of the whole extraction of the realization.
We've got the opportunity to look at Biomarkers for the biombing for the biombs.
Today, we do the first step in this roadson's the parkinson's called the parkinson's called the Parkinson's the first time.
With Aculab and patients and patients, we want to take a very high number of stimulate enough to take enough to make enough to the memory.
We have rooms, the rooms who are a billion people on this planet, people are possible.
Everyone, or without parkinson, can be center, can go to a center to a center for a few center. I'm going to be able to get to the fixed that we've been able to be able to be able to be able to be rights.
Thank you.
If you're going to say,000 people say,000 people say, "Well, you can say, who can't say, who's not going to say, who don't you?
What are you going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients of the patients, if this person on person on person on person on person on person. Okay.
Some of them, you may not to the end.
But we sample of a huge data, different data, different countries are interesting, which is important. Those are important. That's important to be able to funny to functions, which is the empath.
Second, you know, their 86 percent of the same thing?
It's a lot better.
My sler thanasis -- I need to love him because he's so fantastic working on the same thing -- now, that it's also working about the milobilobs, and what this projection works, and we're going to be able to be able to be ability.
That's called a change.
That means that people can do -- the people can do with the handy on the test and the test people with parkinson, people could take their voice, their voice, their voice, so that their arrivity of their arranger of their arrivity.
That's whatever.
Thank you. Max Lake Lake, my dames and herrible!
Thank you, Tom.
This is what I live in Kenya, I live in Keny Randiobi-National parks.
In the hundreds of my father and the cows and the coast and the national park.
The Nairobi-National park is in the south is just about the south. That means that we can related to the wildlifebras the parks.
The redes that the solution that the solution, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our vieties.
This is a our care of our covered to be after the morning. I was wake up and found it was a box. It was a box. It was a box.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we think we're going together with our treatments and the way of the side of our terms of our animals.
Something like children, I learning.
Our career career today. They're going to be our camm and our camm and our camm and our case.
and killed the solution.
This is one of sex of sex solution, the Nairobio.
And I think there's a national parks in National Parkarkets, just so few solution.
In my stamm is a junge between sex years, and news and news for the coast for the coast.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fewing for the first thing for the first thing for the fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to see the solutions, but the coast.
But I didn't do it. I didn't do.
I had a second idea. I try to try to try to a vogels.
I wanted to be the solution, I thought, I was stage of the cup.
But solution are very clearly clear.
She goes, the vogels and go back and go back. Mal, and they go back. And they say, and saying, and saying, that's still not still here.
And they were going to killed and tilled our viety.
One night, I wake the stall. I love to a fack of a fack of the hand and that's the lions of the solution.
So for a bit of lights ago, that's moving.
I had a idea.
Sune, I worked on the whole day, I worked on the whole day in my room, and now, and now, and now, and now, and I had took me. America.
I never been age cars and autobattery and a motor of a motor, you want to show you whether you want to read. He wants to be the left.
And I was a best, I was a switchalter a light and out of the light.
This is a little birnein of a little birth of a capture.
And then I build all together.
The slarpanels the battery that battery, the battery, the relationships. I call it a transformator.
And the right thing is the right blind.
You see that the birth to show you the birth, because of the solution.
And this looks like this, if they come up, if they come up.
The light blinks and the lions and the solution I think that I was to believe the stall. Dabei, I was the bed.
Thank you.
I've been doing this installed installed and since we had no problems with solution.
And then our nice our nice.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and they were lions, and she was asking her light, if I could be able to focus.
And I said, "Yeah."
If I was installed the lights. They can see the solution of the hinterground.
Since I've been doing their habits in the number of the light, and they work.
My idea is now going to be in all the cenycet, also for other rule, like Hynopary. The lights or Leopars. The lights.
My exploration to me to a stage of a stage of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse in Cense, and I'm really really sool, and I'm really small.
My new schools are engaged by line, and hope and hope and airplanation.
I've been asking my friends with home, and I'm not going to show the light, we don't show the light, and I'm not going to show the people, and I'm going to use them.
I just a year, I just a junge from the Savanne, the south of his vater. I saw this plane, and I'm going to say, "I'm going to say, "I'm going to sit!"
And here I'm going to do.
