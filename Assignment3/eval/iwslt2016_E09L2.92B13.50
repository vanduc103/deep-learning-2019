When I was 11 years old, I was a morning high full of the clen.
My father was hearing on his little, gray Radio the news of BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual, because of course, because of the news, mostly depressed.
He rest: "The Taliban are familiar!"
I didn't know what that meant to meant, but it made my father, very happy, very happy.
"You can go to a right school school," he said.
I'm going to forgether, I'm never forget.
A couple of school.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I spent it was girls to school.
So I'm sustained me five years, I five years as a junk, and I started my older sister, who don't get more to go to a little bit more than a high school.
Only, we could go to school.
Every day, we could take a different way, even nobody couldn't get a different way where we went to where we went to.
We hided our books in the left, so we could go out of the books, as if we just go.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small wall.
In the winter was, but incredibly, but incredibly hot.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the painting of the difference of the difference, because the Taliban power, because the Taliban power.
We were never sure how much they knew how much they knew.
Do they asked us?
Why do they knew where we know where?
We had anxiety, but we wanted to school.
I had great happiness in a family in a family in education as important and turned into the education.
My grandfather was his time.
As outside of a decided province Afghanistan. He was certainly to send his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- to school and became after its father.
My basically, but I was teacher.
That's what they do.
Two years ago, she went to the ruhest of our house in school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here was the first in his family, who was ever a school education.
For him, it was clear that his children would be a children, also his children, even his daughter, drotzing everything.
He looked like a much bigger risk of his children, his children don't go to school.
I know that I'm just exactly that I was in the Taliban sometimes, sometimes of our lives, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective.
I had good lust to give you a good loss. But my father said, "Thather, you can lose your life.
Here's money can be telling you can be in warside your house.
But one thing is going to be done, and that's what's here, and even if we have to pay with our blood for your blood for your blood for your blood for your schools, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to still up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that's been destroyed by war.
Less than 6 percent of my age of women have a higher a higher a higher than the second baby, and when my family, and if my family, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a stolice Absolventin of the Middlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather, my grandfather who was understanding his family, because he was given to school, his greatest, one of the first one of the first, who was the first one of the first thing that I was gathered me.
He doesn't just like my high school, but also with my high school, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the car.
My family believes.
I have great dreams, but my family has still a greater trees for me.
So I'm global bothers for 10x10, a global both of women for the world.
So I've helped SOLA, SOLA, and maybe some internat for girls in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country,
It's wonderful to see how the shoes of my school with great ears with great earning chances, all of them.
And to see how their parents and various for them to see how to do my parents for me, and I decide, and decide everything.
So as Ahmed. That's not really name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
At a month, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in their village and they're the death of the tath of the roads of the roads.
When he was home, he was sounding the phone and a voice, and a voice, he would be him, he would be falling up to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "This is, if you want to tell you, but I'm not going to use the future of my daughters on playing away from the future and survival and overholds."
What Afghanistan, I realized something that I realized something that's owned in the West, the most often, most of us, the success, the success of us, the success, the father, and the result of his father, and it's also successful.
That's not today that our mothers don't play in our success.
And they're a lot of people who are highly the ones that area of a lot of promise, and a lot of their test future of their tests. But in a society like the in Afghanistan is the unconsciousness.
And the Taliban went to school hundred girls -- because it was some girl -- because it was illegal.
But today, every day, in Afghanistan, about three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so differently.
The Americans are recognize how to us.
I'm notice that the changes are not from the due of the U.S. and repeating all over the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are setting themselves for them to use them, I see a lot of future, I see a lot of future and a lot of walls and a long-term sustainable well.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope of hope and the uncomfortunities, and it remember every day, and I remember the SOLALA.
So, like I have a big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, I've been done -- my life -- my life was done in Africa than ever,
In 1971, I see 77 -- I see it, but it's not -- I've got in Sambia, Kenya, Kenya, algoing algae and Somalia, algae countries working with African countries.
I've worked for an Italia NROO, and every single project that we're on the legs that we're on the legs,
I was doubt.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we found everything we're attention.
Our first project, which is what my first book "Ripples of "Ripples inspired, one that we wanted to show inspiring the sambias, like food, like food.
We came with Italia satgut in South America, in South America, which leads to the Sambesi-Flussi-Flussian population, and we leads to the animates and Zucini and Zucini.
Of course, the answer has no interestsolutely no interest in it, so we pay for the work, so we didn't even tax them.
We were amazing that there was so early an early tales,
But instead of stuff, why they didn't look at the same, we just said, "God,"
"Gerade is just right now to save people to save people the sambias,"
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, we had these practices. In Italy so big, in Sambia so big,
We couldn't believe it and said, "Shat's skin, like simple country."
When the tomates were red, and red, about 200 nights about 200 nights and asked everything.
We said to the Sambiern: "Oh God, the nilpfer!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a country, we don't have a landwaren."
"Why don't you tell us that's not said, "You're not going to ask us."
I thought we were such empathy, but then I saw in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans doing what the English, which made the Franzo, which I was data, I was quite strong with our projects, I was quite strong with our project.
We felt the food to the nilp fighting.
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainty that we don't see the university of African people.
They should be the book "Thead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambian economic economic economics.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have the changed the African continent 1,5 million euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has this money.
Let me just her book.
Let me give you from a African, which we've started.
We're important people are imperialists, colonialists, missionary, and there's only two ways, like we're patriarchalic.
Both words are stucked by the latest of the latest, which means "Vather" which means.
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchal: I'm treating everyone else, as if they were my kids. "I love my children.
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone else, as if they were my dying my dyermine.
That's white people in Africa, "bwana," Chef, Chef,
I was growing up when I was a book called "Small I'm going to read the book," he said, "Small," he said, if people don't want to help people, then they don't want to go into the row.
This is the first principle of the help of help.
The first principle of the help is Respe.
Today, the morning of the heart of the conference, which is a stabet, and asked a stabet, and asked, "Can you're not going to imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react on people, and he's going to react a system called companies, which is never going to be a little bitiased, but you will never be able to motivated to the distribution of the position, the position of the position, the position of the position of the
What you do -- you're going to do is the mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you're going together with the sky.
We don't work from books.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Cneipen.
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally flying friends and find out what the person wants to find out what the person.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can make someone else a idea.
If these person don't like to do what do you do?
The passion for the passion for the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the real growth is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge, because no one can be recovered.
The person with the idea has not the idea, but it's not available.
A lot of years ago, I had this one: Why, why do we stop in a community and people to say what they should do, why don't we hearing them? But not in community.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
Nobody have never been shared, and they're never publically say what they want to do with their money to make what they're seeing.
Planation has this blind flow.
The most clearly people known to create the community of opening trees.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, a social infrastructure, which is not existed.
A new board to be created.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedroom, who's house with you in your head, and in the caf<unk> sitting your caf<unk>, the middle of your passion to food in a way that life to transform your lives.
I have this in It's trying to try and trying to try to do this.
I promoved to the time and tried to get the time and trying to get what they should do, where we should do what they're doing.
And so I love in the first year, and I had only walked into the first three days, and I had half of my first customers. I'd him. He was a garage, he was a garage, and I half him, and I'm going to go to sell him to go to the organizing.
I half this fish fishermen, and I'm not working on a friends, and I don't look at a factory for 60 cents<unk> cents<unk> center for Sushi, but after Japan for 15 dollars for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government, the government, "How do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and high."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Make it."
We've done it in 300 community in 300 community.
We've been helped 40,000 companies.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go to a new generation.
Peter Drucker, one of the best companies, the story, starting with 96 years ago.
Peter Drucker was Philosophyprofessor, before he was created with companies, Peter Drucker said, Peter said, Peterprint, in fact, in fact, indeporate society and economy."
Planation is the death of the entrepreneursciousness.
So you build covers to know what the clock without knowing what the most course of human covers and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these to get these together.
You have to give them discretion and privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
For the presentation, you've got the most applauded morning?
<unk>ral, empower people. The eating you've got applaud.
I want to say that companies to say that companies is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial Revolution -- nicherbare fossil fuels, fuels, and suddenly, there's suddenly systems that are not sustainable.
The connection of the future is not sustainable.
The friend of the content of the instandment is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we have to look at them, like we're going to get afterwards, transporting to correspond to them, transportation and with them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will revolution for the green revolution? Universities? Universities? Do you're you?
The government? Do you're you.
It's going to be careful. And they're going to do it.
I'm going to make a future in a future of many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were embracted to the future of New York in the city of New York in 1860.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happened in 100 years, with the city of New York, the shelful, the city was a city: The city wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? You saw the curve and said, when the curve and said, if the population in this tempoint in this tempox million pounds to people, and it would be impossible to people, and it would be impossible to be impossible to be able to figure out the mind.
Because they went on the mistake.
1860, they see the difficult technology that lives from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there was 1001, there was 1001, 1001, 1001.
The idea that one other technology, had made the running, and there was little fabrics in the background.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with companies.
And when he needs to be able to give them a discretion.
And at least they don't get them and talk to you.
So, as next to them, you have to tell them, engaged and empowervice.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the smallest company, all of the smallest company, three things out of the line: The product, the product, the consumer, the consumption, and his financial market.
Rather?
We never have a single person who can do something produce something produce something produce, and we can sell the money can care.
That's not existed.
This person was never born.
We've written by the research and the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Fordinary, Fordinary, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that allows allowed together, only one: No, only one: No, just one person has been a person.
Now, we're going to leave 16-year-old companies, and we start the entrepreneurs, and we start to give them the first two side of Richard Bransons Autobiography, and the first one of the 16-year-old birds. The first one of the second.
No one time, "I" and 32 times.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody green a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we create a community, in the average that you have a little bit of Hinterground, in Caf<unk>s and Bars and Bars and Bars, and your engaged covery, what someone is that someone who has done to do with you.
What can you make it? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you're going to go to the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Meople you know that I'm going to fin?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of freedoms that can be undergrounded by the companies, and we've got to help them figure out the middle of the middle of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economic economic economic economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be true, alice in the wonderful.
The penn State University, I asked me -- a Docentin for communication -- at the communications in communications.
I had anxiety --
Rightly afraid. After this students with their big brains and their big big books and their big books, and their big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big b
But as the conversation of the conversation, he went to me as Alice as Alice, when she looked back to the cannins and a door to a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I was involved with the students. I was just astonishing about the thought that they had to discovered that other wonderful that other wonderful.
I think that to open this door to open this door, it means it's great communication.
We need to change incredible communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that our biggest problems that our greatest problems, energy, energy, and if we don't understand about it, and if we don't know about it, I don't think it's not going to believe that we don't know that weight as a responsibility.
But these great conversations are not coming to understand our scientists and engineers and engineers,
So scientists and engineers, bits, clearly clearly.
I want to show you a few answer, how to make it, how to see that we can see that the science and technology and technology, with their technology, sexy and spaneously.
The first question that you need to tell us, is, and?
Sagtt ourselves why was just a scientific are so relevant for us.
Says not only that their trabells are differently, but they say that their traffics, but also tells us that their traffic structure in our bone, because they're important structure in our cookings, because they can understand and relate others.
And if you do that, what you do is you do, then you're avoid.
From afterwards are a hands of eurrence.
I mean, you could use their doctors and pretty much, but why don't you just say, "Ruma and time," and time," which is much different for us?
Our thought that you're not going to make the same as their nive same as their niveaughters.
As astein's already said, "Make the things like possible -- but not easy."
You can tell us something about eual scientific area of scientific areas, without compromise, without compromise.
A few things are involved, for examples: examples, stories and analogies, and analogies.
And if you're doing your work, then the stories, then the stories.
Did you ever asked young, why it's "Stichpunct"?
What happens when someone is that someone else? One, and you know, and with these points, and with these points.
A following as this is not just long, but also, it's also slowly too much more on the language of our brains and dading our brains and dading it.
This example of geneview of genes of genes, we showed a lot of effective. It shows that the special structure of the trabele of trabekled to the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration of the effecture of the effect.
The trick here is a single thing to use, simple satzing satzing, which is audience that can be loss, orients can use the audience, orients, and the pictures that are also affective and graphics that are a terrible to make a terms of distance, and terminy
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these door and the wonderlands and the technology and the technology and technology in your technology and technology.
There's the engineers that I've been involved in my early, with the <unk>Nerd in my mind, I want to make all of the equation, I want to collapse everything with a same.
So, in fact, the science of education and education, and your father, expensive, so that's the audience, which is important, and multiplicated with the audience, and multiplicated with the economics, and it's incredible work. And it's incredible.
So scientists and engineers, when you're going to be such approached me to me.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy can be a cell phone in Syria in Syria.
With a handy can tweet a message and a protesta work in <unk>gype of Egypt.
And with a handy can take a song, you can take a song, and you can get sounded in SoundCloud and box.
All that's a handy possible.
I've been in 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the city in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people for changes on the streets and the constrated.
We're in the highway, and we're going to imagine that all these people who had changed on the tasks, a handy in the task.
Who in Saal has a handy there?
Hald it.
Half you high phone, you're high, you're high!
Hald it. Aroid, a souple of a blackberry, which is a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
This is 350 cells of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.Kommission is a reline.
This is called the riverline is called Rightliny to the frontier.
This reline is that every telephone is that every telephone in Europe, every Internetdia, every Internetdia, a bandbread of the entire europe, a bandbread of bandbread.
Who do you know what? Who's a real bad?
Who's a sending send?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years from your phone to two years of your phone or your Internetanby or your Internetanbia.
And everywhere in Europe, people are the people on Europe, "That's not going to."
They said, we wanted to these precurredators.
We want to be self-bestimate self-digital time and we don't want to be the telephone and Internetdia, and Internetdies, all of these information about us.
There was an advice, Journalists, Preester, the Preester, "That's not going to."
And here you can see how two thousands of people on the streets of Berlin streets and said, "Freeity."
And some of them said, this could be the stasium 2.0.
The stasi was the secrets in Ostance.
And I asked me, whether it works really works.
Can you really know all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone, I asked my telephone, the decom that was the greatest telephone, and I asked them to be the greatest telephone, and I asked them all over my information that they're all sent me.
And I asked her, she asked them, and she wondered them, and they didn't get a right answer.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life, because it's protocolated.
So I decided to do a general experience, they wanted to have a sense because I wanted to have these information.
But the carry telecom said, no, no, we'll give you apply to give you this information.
At the end of the end of a compared with them.
I'm going back to the future, where they all send to me all of the information.
Because in the twice of the boundary of the boundary that the leadership of E.U.
So I'm going to get this half of environment with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
350 cells information.
First, I saw it, and I said, well, it's half a huge datei. Myetweet.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
That's six months of my life in this datei.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I start with it?
Because you see where I'm going to see where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information, I want to go to the public.
I want to make them audience.
Because I want to show people what I want to show people what is the preventing.
So with the time Online and Open Data City, so I've data City.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reinceooms and racooms, you can pull back and back.
You can do any step, I do, I do it, after all.
And you can see how I can see how I'm going to see after cave after closely, and how many ancients, and how many anripe.
All that's possible to this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just like, I call my wife, and she running me, and we talk about each other.
And then I went to a few friends and they run a few friends.
And after a while you and you're going to put this huge competition, and we've got this huge competition.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they're going to go to the time they go to bed a bedding.
You can see all of it.
You know, you can see the central figures, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you can see access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control the society.
This is a bauplan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect developed developing a society about how to do a society, because you know who's a email, who's possible, everything that's possible to this information.
And these information are being for months, 6 months, in Europe to 2 years.
How I said to reminded that all of these people in the streets in the streets in the high-89 Handys in their tasks in their task.
And the stasi, who had been aware of the demonstration of the demonstration, and when the stasius, who would have never been going to be the leaders, then this maybe that's never happened.
The case of the Berliner Mauerliner may not states.
And also, not the case of the case of your ice.
Because today, instead of companies and companies like many information specifically, how they can get overline and often online and often.
They want to be able to success our lives, and they want to follow the popularly long.
But self-bestime and a life in the digital time, not a video.
But everyone has to fight for the self-bestimation today.
You have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you go home, you say that Privacy is a value of 21st century, and that's not older, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say, you're going to tell your eyes, just because companies have to have the opportunity to specific information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone, you've got your phone who have security that they've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you remember your handy, you remember the self-bestimming in your digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituosens, snellrestaurants, brought broughts.
So the city planets, and so the city, and the name South Central Central, so he's changed him in South Los Angeles, as if it changes in South Los Angeles, which is something that's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituosens, snellrestaurants, broughts.
So like 26,5 million other Americans live in the food South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-thrus, the drive-by-by-by-byear-byear-byear-byear-old south Central Los Angeles.
The comic is that the Drive-thrus more people, more people than the Drive bys.
People are south Central Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The fatherity is in my fourth is created in my fourth, five times more than about 15 kills, which is about 15 kilometers.
I couldn't go to transform it.
And I asked me how you feel like you would feel like you'd have a stuff, if you had no access to health if you'd see every time you see the negative effects that the best expectations that has been able to see the best earthquake.
I'm going to give the role of the role and selling as buying as buying.
I see Dialysecialysecialyse as starbucks like Starbucks.
And I've got to stop that this ones.
I captured that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And then I had no lossible for 45 minutes to get a pesticians to get a pesticians that's not with pesticians.
So I plant, I put a food-wy-wald water.
It's a piece of land that we call Parkanlage.
It's 45, it's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing that it's the city of the city.
But you have to pay it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I have to half."
And I decided to hold it into Stand.
So I got my group, and my groups that LA. Green ground, and we started together, and we started together, and observation, so that's all the program, so the whole program, so the whole program,
We're a kind of imagination, we're making a lot of general signs and all social signs and all the city, it's completely free, and everything we do, it's cost.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone else.
The city came to me and he was a practical practical a practical practice, and said that I had to be a richness.
And I thought, "Come is, right?
A richter-based anti-foot-food-based on a piece of land, which is real?
And I thought, "Cool. Her so that."
Because this time, it wouldn't go to the males.
The LA. Times, Times, Steve Lopezz, and I was made a story about it, and talked to the city and talking about the city of Green Green Green Green Green Round.org and 900 difference.
We'd gave you in the hands.
My city rather than highway and said that she's supporting it, and I love what we do.
So why don't you shouldn't do it?
LA. It's in the United States, most biggest states in the best of the city.
They're best 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough fly enough to plants to plants to plants.
Why to do that, they shouldn't find it?
Through the approach of a plant, you're 1,000 sames.
With green Bohuns in the value of a dollars and community in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my homebothers, I say they should be able to build their own food.
His eating food is like his own money is how his own money.
Look, I have a conversation in South Central.
I'm going to go there. I've got my sons.
And I'm surely remote this part of this preparent reality, and I fabricians, and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden was my graffiti. I'm plants my art.
So just like a graffiti-courning, the walls, the walls and parks, I'm a beautiful, I'm a parklaws and Parkanla.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of piece, and the plants and the trees are my dreams for these hopes.
They would be surprised what the Earth can use it as a line, when you use it as a legs.
You can't imagine how it's a sunlume is a sunlume is, and how they're leadership.
So what happened?
I've been experienced to a instrument for the first instrument and the consumeration of my fourth.
To change the community, you have to change the collaboration of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wonderful as children's going to be affective.
Garners is the therapistic and coastic and coastic, especially with the city.
You know, you're going to get a superience.
I remember this time when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30, she was came up in my garden, and I came out.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry because they were there, and I said, "What do you have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been written when I saw people looked like this, and I was so close to do it, and that's just asked me, people asked me, "Fin, you don't have an afraid, you don't get your food."
And I said, "Thy teaching, no, I don't know what they're not afraid.
It's about the streets on the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it back to her healthy."
At the other time I lived a garden in this obdession in Downtown LA.
These are the guy who are helped me to decided to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how it was influenced and how they've been able to see with her mother and her grandmother and her grandmother, and it was great for a moment, and it was just for a moment.
Green reason has been plants about 20 garden.
For our environmental works came as 50 people and they're all freewilled with all freewillions.
If kids carbon, it eat children.
If they taken Tomata, they eat domata.
But if they don't get anything about it when they don't get anything, like food and body eating conflicts, they eat, they eat them, they're eating them.
I see young people who want to work, but they're working in this thing -- I see -- I see in this thing -- I see on the path, which is exactly on the path, and the number of them, and the next though they're going to go.
The Garden, I see a children, where we can train these kids can train themselves to care their communities to care after lives.
And if we do that, who know who knows?
We could bring the next bring the next building Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Earth, we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole voice in Garden, where people can share the food in the same blocks.
I want to take a ship of ship and they're using it in health caf<unk>s.
So don't understand me.
I'm not talking about costs, because it's not sustainable.
The comics of sustainability is that you need to behavior.
I'm talking about people, people working to hold people, and children from the streets, and they're going to leave the stolz and the eating, if you're going to make your own food food, and if you can open up.
So what I want to do here is to do here is to do.
I want to be that we all sorts of ecological rebellers, Gangster, Gangster.
We need to start the picture of Gangsters.
If you don't have a ganger.
If you're going to start with 's clear?
And let's read the coffeee.
If you want to make meeting with meeting, if you don't want to make you in a counter students and a meting, where you want to do something about it, some sort of sort of sort of sort of smell.
If you want to make meet you want to get your garden, in my garden, so we can use any sort of small snow.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
Oxford English words in the entire Oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No,"
Although in 19th century, a newspaper, a better definition, "It's a better definition, someone who is someone who is someone who's an appreciate, program or line, program or line, program or line, programming the power of power.
I don't have any idea what's called "spray."
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all politicians that they need to control the language.
For example, for example, for example, the British Parlament, time, time, not the exactly the word of the debating.
And this was actually back to the mutes of a man's carrying with the extraordinary names Brass Crosby, who was sured with the Parlament.
She was helped him in the Tower of London and he was a muthor, but he was mutig enough enough to clean, and he was so much unfortunately, he was so much unfortunately that he was so much uncomfortable.
And only a few years later, we find the first norrative for the first night, "so strong as Brass. Viety.
Brassed on the English word for books.
But that's not true. It's not going back to a record of pressure.
But to show you how words and politics are launched, I want you to take you to the U.S., I want to take you to the Unability of the Unability.
You saw the question of question, how to use George Washington, the state of Washington,
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a republican nation?
And that's been debate in Congress,
And there was all kinds of possible propositable.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernor Washington, and other, others, and other, other, and other bodies of the United States of America, and other people of America Washington.
Not even a present.
Some people wanted to call him a nice conduction.
They thought that was true.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king of time.
It would have been working.
But everyone was unbelieved, because these debate three weeks, because these debate 3 weeks.
I've got the day of a senator, which is strong, "Immer still the same is the same subject.
The reason for the connection and the long time was that the representation was that the representation was the senat.
The representances didn't want to be that what's going to do. They didn't want to him.
Can you call it, and it would be possible to be able to be able to bring its nights.
They wanted to him the most most painting, the most painful title, the most painting.
This title was "President."
President. They didn't existed the title. He existed. But he means that someone else would be a translation.
It's something like the prediction of a Jury.
He had no larger than the recording "Ampasser" or "Ampasser."
Sometimes, there were president smaller colonial community and governments, but it was really an incredible title.
So this is why the senat him.
They said, "That's long, you can't call him President.
This cerles has to be different covered and explored citizens and citizens.
Who will take him, if he's going to take a thumb small title like President of America?"
And also after 3 weeks of senat on the senat.
Instead of the course, and you're not going to use the title of the course, but they wanted to create the colds, and they didn't know that they were not affective to the methods and methods, and methods.
You can learn about three interesting things.
First, I think, and I find the best -- until now, I don't find out whether the senatures that the title president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title has just been in the title.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says that something temporary -- then you've got 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important point, that's the most important point, the title "President of America," is not so much more than that, right?
This has something more than 5,000 nuclears to do something more than 5,000 nuclear volcence of the world and the largest volconomy of the world and a photograph of drones and this whole stuff.
And it's really a story and story has given the size of the size.
And so the senat at the end of the end.
They have a respectables title.
And the other sorry of the sense of the sense of illness -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all sound like this, like the classes with the 5,000 nuclear boundaries, and so on.
So the end of the senat and the representancesentances, because nobody has been felt that feels when a whole time you're going to feel that you now is the president of America.
And this is the most important thing you can take with, and with the things I'm going to take me.
Politicians trying to use the reality to create the reality and reality to control the reality, but actually changing the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality, the reality of the reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelled 50 rebelled a campaign of Diabada -- a 19-year-old, fire of Jacksonville, Florida.
I'd thousands of my black coverse Halby country, a pair of lederandal and covered a rocket in the regulation of government that I couldn't see any time I couldn't even see it.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
So I was slowly, I was written with the war, all of the war, and all of the new pyjama Partys and football playing with ristic samstairs and footprints with ristic southernic southerness and religionalistic servation.
But this is the geography of self-shelf.
And so I'm going to stand here, citizens, South Afghane, Southeists God, atheist and a radical artists and a radical artists, the last nine years in Afghanistan, and worked in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of things that we can do a lot of things that you could do, but I couldn't make a personality, but I want to make art, I want to make art, and I want to make authority and cars today and cars today and carrying the reality and reality and cars.
I want to spend a day in life of a distance -- Gangsters who spend his distributed communists like <unk>Popstar Bling, and appears and popular bubble-peffection and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's suns can do is to make the Dihad-Gangster than the Parlament and a choice and a choice with the Slogan: "What's myself! I'm talking to me! I'm talking to you."
And trying to use these campaigns to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosiosize the nationalhels.
I want to take a corruption in Afghanistan, and I'm going to take a project called "Rievement," which you're going to take a wrong control of cabulities, and authorities, but in the cars and cars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan, my mind, my mind, which is afghanistan conflict.
The war and the war and the free-making approach to him, and a new environment for style and models that you can only a model that you can only a model for soldiers and self-mode and self-mordating sky.
And I would like to see how a simple simple cabularly, and I would like approach from 189999, and we've got a dialogue today, that the development of the world's create applications in the past of the pastics.
But for all of these things can come in prison, they can get mission, they can be missed.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to lost the geography of self-low.
This is my favorite. What's your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since a less time, I was working as a model.
Second 10 years, right?
I have the sense that's now in the room, I've got a unexpected, because I wouldn't have to start this cleididement.
Fortunately, I've got something to do something like this.
This is the first time that someone is that someone on TED book on TED books, so you can see, so you can see it happy to see.
If there were a few women really explored when I got out when I got to tell me that I don't need to say that I'm going to go to Twitter.
I also realized that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very shortly 10 seconds of me.
And it doesn't have any chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to be carrying them.
The most difficult thing is to pullover, the pullover about my head, because then you'll all look like me, you're nothing to do, so long as head.
In order to be.
Why did I do this?
That was personal.
Well, it was hopefully as this image.
One is a powerful, but a visual.
I've just changed your minds of me in 6 seconds of my own.
And on this picture -- I had never been never a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photograph, I said, I was solve my hand in the hand and with my hand in the hair in the hair.
And then, from operations or the wrong bridge, which I've been two days ago, there are two days of working on the work that we're only possibilities, and our questions, and our question -- although it's affected and our lives -- although, our lives influence -- although,
Through to be hot to be hoth today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I am a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a high school, white woman, and in my branches.
I'm going to ask the questions that people who are always asking me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means, but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, is a model in genetic lottery and a important experience and maybe you're going to ask you.
Now, in the last few centuries, we don't just beauty and young, and yetrically defined, and we're including the conservation, but also, we're also hospital, but also hospital, highly highly.
This is a same for me. And it's a same for me. And it's a number of me.
I know there are people in the audience that are people in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models: "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Lui Wen. Lui Wen."
And in the first comments, I'm going to make your model science.
But I've got to tell you that in 2007, a very at the year 2007, a very at the NYU all Models on the nYU all the models, every single money, and that was booked by 6767, and that was only 2767 or two percent of the process, only 27 or less than two percent of the process
The next question that I always been said, "Can I'm going to grow up, I'm going to grow up?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know what I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I really want to girls that little girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all be.
You can be presidentinent of the U.S. or the inventin of the next Internet, or a Ninja Herzirurg Dichinter, which is great, because then you would be irregrrees, because then you know, the first."
If they're still thinking about this great, "No, no, Cameron, Cameron," I want to say, "Who," I say, "Who's my cameron."
Because I don't have a responsibility for the cowerful creditors of American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next sky.
To say that you're going to be a model, it's so that you want to say that sometimes you want to win the Jackpotto the lotto.
You can't be affective and it's almostic and it's not a career.
Now, I want to give you 10 years ago, I want to tell you about 10 years, because other than high-respiring, because it's just just just just just just just just to fold.
If you're going to give you a photograph, and you can see how a nice, and the couple of course, and the cameron, and then we want to go to the legs, and then you go to the legs, and then you go to the poor, and this poor, this poor, and this poor, this poor, and this poor, this poor
It looks like this.
Hopefully comic than that in the middle.
That was ... I don't know what happens.
If you're going to sell the school and a few jobs, and a few jobs, you can't say that you can't say that you're going to say that you want to be a lot of the U.S., but in life, you'll go to the life, "10 years" you'll go to go to the world."
The next question that I'm often saying, "Who's all photos?
And yes, so pretty much every photos will be retired, but this is just a little part of the story.
This is the first photo, I did this, and that was also the first time I was also the first time I was trying to drug. I had no one biciniode.
I know that's pretty personally personally, but I was a young girl.
So I just looked at a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm at the day.
My friend must have to start me.
This is I'm on a pyjama Party, a few days ago, a few days ago.
This is what I'm with the football-Magazine.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
It's constructs and it's constructs of a group of profis, from Hairstylists and Makeup coast and photographs and photographs and stylists and the prediction and the prediction and the non-production.
Okay, askay, ask me, "Cree, you know, "Cree things?"
Yes, I've been trained too many 20-cm-Abs that I never met, but the things I'm going to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it, and we don't like to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, and one day I went to a laden and I had my money, and you gave me the cambridge for the cambridge for the cambridge.
As a teenager, I went to my friends with my friends, and they were surface, and of course, and of course, we were looking at a redigious food, "It's going to go on," and we could further.
I have this cost-scale things that I get to see my personality and not because of my personality and there are people who are people who are personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and we filmed in the last year, 85 percent swareness and mostly young men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men, and Latinos, for the question, "Who I'm going to ask you to go to the question?"
So, "How often I'm going to go to the point? When I'm going to go to the stuff?"
And I found my researchers for these talks that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the U.S. and these numbers are not going to be 17 percent when they're 17 percent when they're 17 percent when they're 17 percent.
The last question is, "How is it, it's a model?"
And I think they expect them, they expect this answer: "When you're a little bit of harm, you feel a little bit, you feel very happy and fabulously, you feel very happy and fabulously.
And Backstage, we're going to give you a answer that maybe this eindruck.
We say, "It's really great, so much to record, and it's greative, inspiring people, living inspiring people."
Everything that's true, but it's just a half of the story, because what we never before the camera, which I never said, "I feel like, "I feel like told me, "I feel like me."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think about my exception.
And if you ask yourself, "What would I be happy if I had to be happy if I had to have your legs and global harm?"
Then you should make a few models, because they've got the thinest legs and the most final legs and the coolest coolest coolest coolest coolest women's the most female on the planet.
When I was noticed that talked about this talk, he's very difficult to me, a real imagination, because one of the bit, because one of them, I felt very uncomfortable, and say, "I got all the benefits, and I got to say, "I've got told me," and I was going to tell me,
It was very difficult to be a very difficult, a result of unfortunately and received by the biggest nutrients, when I'm one of the biggest nutrient.
But I'm also happy and I'm going to stand here, and I'm going to stand up here, and I've been here, I've been here before 10 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 30 years, and my career, because I wouldn't know what I wouldn't know, because I wouldn't know what I't really do.
If you take a little bit of this talk, then you're allowing the power of imagination, and the powerful successful successful successful.
Thank you.
I've never forget the words of my grandmother, which is never forget that's in the exilience is, "Son, list of Gaddafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widafi Widdafi Widdafi Worldafi Wid Wid Worldafi
But who never would never be something like a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the liby school revolution of the same revolution of the waves of the waves of the waves of the mass of the oldests, as well as in the Egyptical revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, inside and outside Libyens, and extraordinary, to start a tyrannize a revolution of the tyrannic revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Now, liby, liby, women and men standing in the first range, the end of the regimes, highest slogans of the freedom, and social slogans of the air.
They've got aware of muthafing mutes by terrutal dictaturedafishing.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the most farmers, from the most farmers, until the south.
Finally, after a time-shift months, and almost 50,000 toted to start to start our country and the tyranians and tyranize our country.
But Gaddafi, every big big big boring a citizen, a corruption and the corruption and the reason for corruption and the reason for course.
Four decades had gaddafis, Gaddafis, the infrastructure, the infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The consciousness and the challenge, I called the challenge, I as many other women, like many other women's civil society, and we're reports of survey and national exercise and national equations.
So took 200 organizations were during and about 200 organizations were taken to the case of Gaddazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in Exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasm, I started to the topicshopshopshopshopshopshops, human education and leaderships.
With a wonderful group of women, I women, I women, and I women, a movement of women, a movement of women, leaderships, and the public healthy lives, the public heads.
And I met the payer, I met a very difficult environment, a survey, a clearized polarized, a politics, and a politics of Dominanic politics and explained.
I lived a initiative of peace and women who are affective women to make a liby choice and to make a law, a law, each citizens, each citizens, and told the rights and citizens to be able to country and country and country and country and country
In the end of our initiative, our initiative and successful.
Women women 17,5 percent of the Nationalalkongresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But the longest slowly, the euphories and the whole revolution to <unk>n't each day, we waiting news of violence.
And one morning, we're looking at the money of the money and Sufi-Gralter Mosche.
In another morning, we got news about the morning of American bothers and the angriff on the message.
At again, another morning the morning of opening the army.
And really, every day, we're going to look at the milize of the milize of the miles and their own power and their power and their power and laws and laws.
Our society, against a revolutionary evolutionarized, polarized by the ideal and principles of the ideal and principle, social Gerek, social Gerek, social Gereas.
Intolerancial, explained and Rache was to the icones of the evolution.
I'm not there today today with the success of successful story of our records and the choice.
I'm a teacher today today that we have a nation that we've been done, and the wrong decisions and the wrong decisions.
We've been able told our priorities.
Because the choice of written written in Lybia or sure of sure.
Hat the rubber of rubbers and the white between female and men and men, and men's national virtual virtual violational virtual virtual possible?
No, that's not.
What's it?
Why will our society is going to go on and dominated by self-shined politics of the dominance and the explances, slow and the women?
Maybe the women didn't have the only thing that has female, but the female women's female of the compassion, and the sound of the middle of the middle of the female.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensumer, as they bring the choice, and the number of polarization and decision and decision and decade two.
Our society needs the qualitative construction of the webs of the female, quantitative construction of the website.
We need to stop in the name of the corns of the corns and a day of the roach.
We need to start to start to create the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the compassion.
We need to develop a female discovers that are not just going to be able to use the following, but also to use: Gnade, collaboratton collaborative consciousness, approach.
These are the ideal that are a voice that a voice lybia broadcasting lybia to exciting peace.
Because the peace has a alchemy and in this alchemic and in this alchemics and masculines and masculines.
This is the real running river.
And we need to use existence, before we do it, before we do it sociopolitical.
After a trial from the Koran "Salam" -- Fried <unk> "The World," "The God,"
The word "rawing" again, all of the abrahamic tradition, and the same Arabic written, the same Arabic wonderful symbolized the word "bolized feminal feminal feminal femins that the whole personality to make the whole personality of humanity and
And just like the motherleible of the embryo, which is the most completely such as nutrition of the compassion of compassion.
So this is why he said, "My Gnade Gnade, all things."
So this is why he said, "My Gnade has been a previous board."
And so we're going to be all the minds of the gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the world, and I grew up with the lower.
And I was very proud.
In school, we're going to see the story of Kim Il-Sung, but we learned not very much about the world, except that America, South Korea and Japanese are our fine.
Although I was often asked me, how the outside of the outside of my life in North Korea, I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until away.
With seven years, I saw a public head, but I thought, but I thought my life in North Korea, my life in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to live with myself.
But in 1995, my mother was a letter of war, from the sister of a collegin.
Darin stand: "When you're going to be here, our five families don't have anymore on this world, because we've been for two weeks.
We're going to start together and our bodies are so body switching."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time, I heard that people in my country.
I went to the bubble, I went to the bottom, and I saw something that I can't get more from my memory.
A live woman launched on the ground, and a above in their poverty in their army in their poverty in their face.
But nobody half them because all of them, because all of them were so that they were to careful and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hungry in North Korea.
At the end of North Koreaner who was more than a million northern of the heart of the open, and many more and many more and bas, because they're just because they're based on the side.
Stromously, stressed, so that's been holding all the time, excepts, excepting the light of China on the other side of China on the other side of the Ufers,
I always asked me why she had there, and we didn't have.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the river of the Fluss Amrocast, the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the flow of flows, and it's very simple north Koreaners who are the flight.
But many sters.
Sometimes I saw people in the flower.
I can't tell you how I can't finish, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I've been decided to China, the chinairs of China.
I thought I was a short time for a short time of my family,
I would never have thought that it was 14 years together together together.
In China was very hard to live as young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be a northcorean flying, but I would be hard. But I would be hard. But I'm not just extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Becored, because northcored in China, because I'm illegal.
So I lived in standing that my realization could be my reality, and you would be able to fly in a bad send of north Korea, and you would go back to North Korea.
One day, my bigger alptraum was true when I was found from Chinese police and in the police and in the police of the police.
Someone, someone else, North Koreanerin, so they did my Chinese, and they test my chinese questions.
I had solided to my heart, I thought, I would exploding.
Would anything else, it might be unnaturally, I could be else, and I could be each other.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I'm subject my life, but I'm going to control my feelings.
After they were finished with the example, said, "That was a false," was a research.
It's not North Korean."
And they're walking me. It was a wonder.
Some North Korean, in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had great happiness.
Although they were expective, they were free, they were free international pressure international pressure international pressure.
This North Koreanerins didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, unfortunately north Koreaner in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be followed or public, or public.
Although I had lucky, I had lucky, it's a lot of other north Koreaners,
It's tragic that North Koreaneran their identity and hard to survival.
And after she's a new language and worked on the head, and worked their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the most decided to go to South Korea, and I started to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
Mich in South Korea, no one was a bigger challenge, a greater challenge, when I had thought it was thought it.
English was so important that I had to learn how to learn to learn to learn.
And I've got the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all corean, but inside, we've been very completely each other, on the participation of 67 years of the participation.
I'm going to fly a identity.
Bin I'm South Koreanerin?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Plike, there was no lander, that my home, my home.
Although I was the fighting of the south Korean life, I had a plan.
I'm already for the attention of the university.
I think, as I was going to be able to high school, I would have a bad an air.
The north Korean Behold, the money, which I family, and when I was sent to my family between my family between place on the country.
They had to fly as possible, so I started to plan.
North Koreaner, a unbelievable stream to their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to overcore and South Korea and South Korea, Ironically, Ironically went back to China and made me back to China and I was on the north Korean Grence.
Because my family, I had to live them, I had to live them on more than 2,000 miles through China and then after Southostasia.
The bush is a week, and we've been almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost been almost almost almost almost a week.
Once when the bus on the bus on the business, a Chinese police.
He took the exhibiting of all the ways and started questions.
And my family doesn't understood, I thought she would be found.
When the Chinese example, my family, I decided told him, and she said that she was going to believe her attention, and I was since.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, he was happy.
We've got it to read it to the laotic garren, but I had to bring the border to bring the border of Laos.
But even after we had the boundaries of the border, my family inhaft, I illegal garrency.
After I had money, and shooting, and shooted my family inside of a months of a months, but course, my family, my family in the mainstad of Laosa.
This was one of the biggest running of my life.
I had done everything to help my family to freece, and we were so close to the family, but my family, just my family, just the southern Corean Bothorean Bothorean Both.
I went back and I went to the increasing and the policeistation, and trying to family, and I didn't have enough money, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then I asked the voice of a man, "What's los?"
I was completely surprised that a friendly remaining.
In broken English and with a wordshoth of English and without my situation and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two other northern North Korean, and two other northern North Koreanorean,
I thank him from whole heart and asked him, "Why help me?"
"I don't help you," he was telling you.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The most exciting frembolized frembolized for me to a new hope that the North Koreaneran, and he showed me the friends and the fremely of friends and the entrepreneurs of fuels, the northern community, the Northern Amerconomy.
Finally, after our long journey, my family, and I remained family, but the freedom.
Many North Korean, they're done by their families, and soon as they're in a new country, they're not a money or not a money or no money.
The international community can help us help us to help us to help us to education and many more.
We can also be the bridge of his between the people in North Korea and the outside of us, because many of us are still in contact with families, and we're going to change them information and generation, the money, northerna, northernavor.
I had a happiness, so much helping aid and inspiration inspiration in my life, I hopeful northern North Koreanians, with international successful international successful.
I'm sure you're a lot more successful North Korean North Korean, also see on the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a bit of a bit.
I don't tell me that I'm not normal.
So I want to show you my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't talk about, but he can't communicating a kind of the best reder.
Remi white what love is love.
He's particularly expensive and expensive.
He's not just a real thing. He doesn't look at the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences and imagine, and imagine: He's never telling a light.
If he singingled out of our childhood, and I'm not even trying to remember the words, I remember one thing: how little bit about the understanding and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16th. He's very good. It's very good.
He's absolutely uncomfortable memory.
But he has a since.
He can't remember if he remember my shocolate, but he remember the public, but it remembers of every long on my iPod, conversation that we had been four, as four, as he was fouring on my arms of the most four public public public public.
Don't they don't be incredibly?
But many people don't stimate.
And in fact, because you don't know in the society of normal pased, they're often, they're often, they're often wrong.
But what my heart was the heart and my soul, and my soul, whether this was the case, although this was not as a case, even though they were able to be a bit of authoritially -- autistically -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who don't trust the people who don't trust the public, it's a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, which is social communications, and sometimes, the learning.
It's like every individual in every individual, it's space, as a sample.
And the world is going to be all 20 minutes in a new person Autism, and whether there's one of the most fastest growing developments of the world, there's no known as a faster or healthy or healthy or healthy.
And I can't remember the first time when I remember autism, but I can't remember, but I can't remember it.
I was born three years old when my brother, and I was born, and I was so on, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months, he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play how it was the other babies, and in fact, and in fact, he didn't really interested in me.
Remi, and regular world, in his own world, with his own rules, and he found found out the smallest things like a cars, like a cars in a series of the room in the room, which is what's going on.
And when he was older, he was different and the differences were smaller.
But the woods and the frame and the frustrate and the frustrate of hyperactivity was something really a really unique: a reinfully natur, a junning nature, a junky, who had never been a human, who had never been a human,
Exception.
Now, I can't learned that there was some of the moments in my family, moments in my family, I wished that they were exactly how I wish I would be like I wished.
But I'm going to go back to the things that they've leave me to the things that they've leave me to individuality, communication and love that these things I'd like to tell you that these things I wouldn't want to tell you that this is not going to tell you.
Normality about beauty that beauty that difference, and the fact that we're different, and the fact that we're different, that one of us are different.
It means that there's another kind of rather than the other kinds of rather than there are other ways.
And if I just a thing to tell you a thing and to tell you, and then you wouldn't be normal.
You know, you're going to be similar.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a story, and we have a story of us, and in every single earness, and in everything is the ultimate oility is the ultimate open-foresty open-for-dimate open-dddddimate open.
The chance on size, the research and walls in the moment that we try to be trying to be different.
Bitte -- you're not me that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edggerton has a leader and neuriosity, with this photo on the photo on the photo on the projectility and with a million second, and with a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, we're not going to see the world with a million or a million or a million images per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography that femto-Fotography, a new education that it's so fast, that it's time, that they can make time in movement in movement.
And so we can build cameras that can build the absolutely our views to look at education or without a beautiful body in our body, and really in our body, and really in question, which we can ask myself with "Camera"
If I'm going to take a laser and him in a million seconds, and I'm going to take more femtose -- that's more femtoseconds -- that's a packet of photones, and this is a millimeter, and this is a message, and this project, and this is going to be a poton.
So if you take this projectil, this photones, this photones and put it into these flashes, how these photones in the fleashion?
How does it look like light in time?
So this whole events --
So think about it, you think that's actually the whole events are actually less than a nanosecond -- so long than a nanoseclearly -- so light to get this video to make this video to the factor 10 billion, but I'm going to see that you can see the movement.
Noca-Cola coca-Cola hasn't financial.
So in this movie, so let me show you a lot, so let me show you what happens.
The puls, our projectil, our project, driving a photonespaket, a photonpaket, and it's starts to move and that's inside.
A part of the light, after the table, and you see this expensive and you see this exercise.
Many of the photones are reaching the potones of the rivers of the flower and exploding in different directions.
As you can see, there's air, which is airline that's in the flash.
While the waves are reading to the waves on the table and white of the reflexions of the rainflexions on the end of the focus on the end of the focuss are focused on the end of the focuss.
If you're going to take a same project, and it's the same stream, and the video back to 10 billion dollars to see the factor 10 billion, you know how long you have to see how long you have to see here?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long movie -- from a long film -- from a long-term, normal projection.
And how does it look like a little bit of still pictures?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, the table and the wall in the background.
It's like when you're a stein in a texture.
I'm going to make it as a photo mature as a photo males, the movie, but of course, it's our eye picture, but of course, of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the lights the tomate of the tomate, you're going to be done. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the tomate of the tomate, and that's light into their own, and a million seconds.
So in the future when these future, if these femto-Kamera in your camerahandy, it might be able to be able to make a supermarket, and it's a fear, whether it's a fear without touching it.
So how did my teamera was built this camera?
So as photographs know if you're a photo with course, you have a photo, you have very little light, but we've got a billion times a billion times as your citizens, so you get a billion pages, so well, so good light.
So we're doing this: We're going to do this projectil, this photones, and show you this photones, and then you're going to repeating and repeating this gigabytes of data, we've combinate this female to show you the female to show you the female.
And we can take all these roohdates and we can take very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heldence can make us feel like, but how would it be a new series for a new supercraft surgery: to see ecks: to see ecks?
The idea is that we're going to streets on the door.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it will go back to the door, and then reflecting back to the door, and we could use these more simplify these more simpler of light.
And this is not a science fiction. We've built it even built.
Link of our femto-Kamera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we'll be able to put the door.
After our attention in the "Nature Communication" was published by nature.communication, and they've been able to make these animation.communication.
We'll be able to fire, and they'll be able to help them in these walls, and they're going to be in all directions, and some of the photones are going to be able to get our lights, and then we'll be able to leave the trees.
And because we have a camera, the so fast is -- our fast is our faster camera has some skills.
It has a very good time, and she can look at the world in Light, and it can look at the world.
And then we know, of course, we know, but also the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the points of the points.
So, in fact, we can see a laser on the floor, we can see a rooh-Beaking, and then you can see it -- not really sense of these images, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they're trying together and try together, and they're trying to try to try to try to
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We can see a little bit of doing this, we can see the practice, and we can see the cars, we can build a cars that can build the collision and see what's going to see what's going to look at the course of lights, or we can look at the survey.
But because of the blood and tissue is very, of course, it's very, very, very, very, very horrible for scientists, now, now, now, now, now a new picture of picture, there's a new picture of medical education of medicine.
So, like, we can't have a scientists, even a scientist, and we can create a science, and we can create a art, and I realized that all of these gigabytes, and I realized that all of these gigabytes we know every time we don't know anything education.
But it's also happening here,
If you look at this waves under the rivers of the rivers, you see that the waves of us.
The waves should be moving to us.
What happens?
It turns out that we're almost in light, because we've almost in light, and incredible effects and astein's incredibly learned this image.
The reason wheels in the world, in the world, he seems in the world, he seems in the camera in the camera, so by relationship by space and time, by space and time, we can create these consumers, we can create these confusion.
So, if we should be able to create the picture of a new creative confusion, and we should have a new data or new data, and new data, we've all data, and we all have datails on our website and datails.
It's about time. Thank you. Thank you.
There are many opportunities, like our opportunities can be better.
We don't meet every night in the street, so many ways of wisdoms are not going to use this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and share things like a task, snowlones and circlones and circlones.
The projects from my questions, how much matter how much matters?
How can we stop more things without stoping without anything?
How can we share our memory of memory and the country and the country and the country?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so our communities, our communities and trees and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My selection will be remote from the hundreds of hundreds of years, the hundreds of years, beds and trees, I'm sat down to a city, and I'm always a city in the music.
I think every time, every time, every time someone nobody, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city with most of the city in America.
I'm going to be able to do this house and I've been beautiful, and I thought I was a little bit of my life for always changed my life for always changed.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
You're name was Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death.
I've been thinking about death, and I was a big disease for my life, and I brought me to my life, and it brought me now.
But it's hard to me, this sort of missing every day.
It's easy to lose in the case, and to forgether, which is really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends of the old house, I've been able to leave a huge tail and wrote with a shoot, "Bevor, I want to be satter, I want to take a piece of the corn.
I wasn't sure what I could expect on the experiment, but I was the next day, but the wall completely completely and they're going to go on.
I want to share some sentence with you who were written by the walls that were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to sterve, I want to be a piratter."
"Bevor I want to stervey, I want to stand over the International datums."
"Bevor I want to singing for millions of people."
"Bevor I want to sterve a bate power."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netheless."
"Bevor I want to sterve them once I want them to half."
"Bevor I want to be stervey, I want someone."
"Bevor I want to be stervey, I want to be myself."
This is afterward place, and this was a sense of place, and the hope, and the hope and dreams of people needed me to wine and translates me, and translating me while the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not all.
It's about our neighbors and understanding our neighborhood and in a new way and way.
It's about, place for best for best and to remembers and remember what we think about, and to remember what we grow up and change us.
I made this last year, and I've made this last year, and I've got a hundreds of people who wanted to build a wall, and I wanted to build a colleagues and now, I've been able to build a countries like countries, like countries, like countries, like countries, like c
We've shown how much power our powerful places, when we have the opportunity to share our voices, and more with other people.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time and the relationships, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever before the things that are really important to think about the right blend and think that life is that life course, and empowerful.
We're often going to talk about death, about death, or just to think about death or just to think that the death, but I realized that the prediction on the death is one of the death.
The thought about the death of deaths us.
Our common places that shows us what we're going to show us what we're important to share our opportunities, and with more opportunities, and to share our hope, and stories can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us better places us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me, I decided to each other problem for every problem for every problem that we're decided to each other, is that we're going to be as companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you today today, to explain what I do.
Tances is one of the most activities.
We're eventually returned from most of most famous ballett-shaf-taf-like, like you see the same.
For Ballettles a very extraordinary massive massive and abilities, and abilities, and possible events that could have a genetic common.
Traigerly, course, newurological stories like Parkinson long-termost of these extraordinary capacity. That's what I've been doing a ballettuose.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the mind.
In fact, there's a worldwide 63 million people who live in this disease, and they have to symptoms like symptoms like symptoms, symptoms, symptoms, such as we need to use these disease.
We need to measure the research is objective message, and last possibility, really, if we can actually know if we have a projective market, if we've answered that question can be answer.
<unk>rigger is that there's no parkinson and other movement, so there's no biomarkers, so you can't just a blood biombs. The best news. The best neurologists of neurologists.
You have to him in the clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very extraordinary studies, and it's never made it never happened.
But what if patients could do that patients could do this test?
That would be a decided to tour in the hospital. What if patients could make patients?
It wouldn't be a texture of hospital.
It costs <unk>100 percent, in the neurological approaches in the neurological action.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods, with the way that we're trying to exciting, because we're all, in a sense of senses like my cannot, virtuosen.
This is a video of video of vibrating vibrating vibrates.
This is what happens in the healthy, when someone speaks, we can see as a stimming ballettledge, because we can look at all these voice, because we have to coordinate, if we have to coordinate, and we all have to coordinate the genex.
And as Ballet is exploring it enormously much about it.
Think about how long a child, like a child, until it to learn.
And by the louds of the female of vibrating vibrate vibrate, and as the Gliedma, and as the voice of Parkinson's also a parkinson.
On the other way that you can see a example of example of unregular voice,
We see this same symptoms.
To true, swface, switch.
The language will be suffer and it's a symptoms and this is an example of what's a example of it.
This expectations, and this is a voice, sometimes, sometimes, but with thigital microphones and presentize, and present-software, combined with new learning, combined with new lawyers, which is very formed with new critical lawareer, very much more.
How can you feel this tests with clinical mess? Well, they're not both of course, the test.
You know, the infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly. It's not going to be the voice of experts.
So you can be reminded by yourself.
They're very quickly, three seconds.
They're very billed and we know what that means.
If something extremely billed, you can also use it in big mass.
This is amazing sort of slightly now.
We can reduce logistic skills for patients.
Patients don't have to leave a routinecontrolinics.
We can remember ifjective data through half-making.
We can get a serious massive massive for clinical studies and first leadership of the whole population of the whole population of realization.
We've got the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease, before it's before it's before it.
Today, we're doing the first step in this direction, we started the parkinson's settime-Initiative.
With Aculab and patients LikeMe, we want to take a very high-shooting expanding enough to create enough to bring enough this stuff.
We have spent rooms that are the divided to a billion people on this planet on this planet.
Everyone, without Parkinson, can be refleased on a few center to a few center for a few center. I give you a few center of our goal to the exciting of our goal.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people call 10,000 people, you can say, who's healthy and who don't you?
What are you going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patient is that the patient's got to give if this person on parkinson's living or not. Okay. Okay.
Some people will not be created to create it.
But we sample, a huge database, under different environments, which is interesting. These environments are important, because we're important to make these extraordinary markers, which are the real markers for parks.
For the time, their 86 percent genes?
It's much better.
My should be love -- I have to love him, because he's so fantastic worked -- now has to be convinced that it's also working on the mobil function works, which is what this projection works, and we're in 99 percent.
I call this a result.
This is called people -- people can do with the handy, people can do with the cell phone, people with Parkinson could take their voice, their voice, so that their doctor, so that their doctor of the doctor of the disease.
Goes.
Thank you. Max Long, my dames and gentlemen!
Thank you.
Here I live in Kenya, I live in Kenyairobi nairobi-National Parks.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the cows of my father is the Nairobi Nairobi-National park.
The Nairobi-National Park is in the southern English is in the south. It means that Wildtire, the parks of every single time.
The raughters that the solution, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They kill our vieties.
This is one of our cows that were killed. I wake up. I wake up, and I found it was great. It was a great boy. It was our only bully.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we believe that we're came together with our animals and the way we came to our animals.
Some as a kids, I learned solution.
Our warrior warriorans. They decided our stamm and our hearts. They're in our hearts. They're in this problem.
and killed the solution.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobiobi.
And I think there's a nairobi- Nairobi national parks.
In my stamm is a boy between six and new years, and newly for the cows of his father. So I went to me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fewers. Lions for the fire.
But then I realized that we would help us to help us to help us to see the cows that can help us.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to do it with a bird.
I wanted to think that the solution, I thought, I was students.
But solution are very clearly animals.
They're going to see the birds and go back again. Because they're going to go and say, "Well, that's not yeah, that's still there.
And they're taking up and kill our field.
One night, I watched the stall. I love with a flack in the hand to him around him and this time, and this time.
Let's solve the light, which is moving.
I had an idea.
Someone as smaller junking all day in my room, and I took the new roadio, and I took my mother's made me a new roadio of my mother. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took a old car, and I'm going to show you a motorrad. The motorrad. The left or left or left, whether you want to go to the left. He's blind.
And I was a shoot, took a shalter, and I'm a switch.
This is a little birne of a capture of a captain.
And then I built all of it.
The solar panels are the battery that battery, the battery, I call it a transformation. I call it a transformator.
And the recording less blind.
You see that the birth, the birth, because of the solution, because of the solution.
And this is what it looks like for the solution when they come from.
The light blinks and the solution that I believe that I was about the stall. There was the whole time in the beds.
Thank you.
I've got this at home installed and since we didn't have a problems with solve.
And then our neighbors, our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had many of their animals, and she was lost their animals and she asked me if I could tell her the lights installing.
And I said, "Yeah."
If I put the light. They can see the solution. They can see the solution in the background.
I've seven houses, I've got houses in the neighborhood and they work.
My idea is now used to be used in all cases, also for other raubtians like Hyave or Leoparden. The lights. The lights of farms.
My experience, I'm going to give me a stipending schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really excited.
My new school engaged and helps up and helping through spending and tasks.
I even have my friends with my friends and I've been able to come up with the light, where there are no, where there are no, and I'm going to show people how to use them.
A year I just a year ago, one year, who was a boy who was high-h-hour piece of my flying on me and said, "I'm going to sit in a sitch!"
And here I'm going to stand.
I was starting with a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
I'm great, I'm going to be airplane and pilots are my great dream.
I've got a solution. But through my experience, but through my father, I can return the cows and the solution, and we can live without side, side, side, without the solution, without the solution.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language means that: I'm very much.
You know, yes, you don't know how to hear it's a story like your story.
So you've got this stipendium. Yeah.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next to the list?
My number, I'm working on a electrical dotic caza. A electrical dotroza?
Yeah, I know, electrical dune are already, but I want to found my own.
You've got it already trying to try, I'm trying to give you, but I've tried to give up again, because I got a shoot, because I got a shoot.
All the beginning is hard. Richard Turere, you're something very special.
We're going to start your way to do your way.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm old enough, a camera in the hand, is photography my passion. But I want to share with you today with you 15 my favorite both of my favorite, and no one of them.
There was no way to do any kind of Director, no chance, no chance has been a picture. Not even the example of the experience.
In fact, most of your who were made by the most completely remotely tourists.
My story begins as I started a talking about a talk in New York was and my wife, and my wife, on my first built on my poverty, and we were at the first birthday, and we were at the ecke of 57th and 57th.
So, we were a year later, we were back in New York and so we decided to similar education.
Well, you can see what you can see.
When the third area of my daughter said, "Hey, my wife, why, why don't you get to New York and makes it a father-Thter-Thter-Thter-Thter-time to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to lead to
And then we started to make selling tourists, we started to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal the face is when you're talking about a completely frem.
Nobody has never seems to be lucky, and fortunately, someone has done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rises would change our lives.
This is a very hoth today.
This is only one weeks after the 11th, and I had to explain what happens when I had to understand what happens was happening on the day.
These images are much more than just a far more than just a certain moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a way to us a week for a week in the october, and how we change our time and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical, but in all of us.
Because even though we're always doing our perspective of males, our perspective of miles, while they always seeing new miles, and how they see the life with their eyes, and how they see it.
These very intensive time we spend on each other, which we're going to have a little bit, and every year.
Last, while we're talking about one of our rice, and we're talking about how they're suddenly reded to a red market, they showed up a red market, they'd learned as small children, in early love to learned to love.
And she told me about their feelings that she had been able to feel like five-year-olds of these stell-year-old.
She said they remember how to remember the heart of the breast, when she was a new years ago, when they saw the first time.
And now she looked in New York, because they want to study in New York, because they want to study.
And I realized, I realized, the most important thing we all created, memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you, an active role in the most extremely in the most experiences of memory.
I don't know how it looks like this, but it's going to look at this 15 images, I'm on a family photo.
I'm always the picture.
I want to start to tell you today with you today with the image and cut you don't want someone, "Would you do a picture of us?"
Thank you.
