When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clenging crowd.
My father heards on his little bit, women Radio the news of the bright of the BBC.
He looked very happy, very happy, which was pretty unusual, because most of the news.
He running, "The Taliban are female!"
I didn't know what that means, but it made my father, I didn't really happy.
"You can go on a right school," he said, he said," he said.
The morning I'm never going to food.
All right school.
The taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I spent six, and they spent to school.
So I five years, I five years, I five years long as a junk and I started my older sister, that doesn't come from a slightly swimming school.
Only so we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way, even though, even though, even we went to where we went.
We've been able to buy our books in the left, so we could go out as a sell of it.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small wohnzimmer.
In the winter was incredibly, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all know that we knew that we knew our lives: teachers and our parents and our parents.
In the moment, the bottom of the bottom of a week, because the taliban considered.
We were never sure how much they knew about us.
Do they recorded us?
Where are they know where we know where we're going to learn?
We had angry, but we wanted to school.
I had lucky in a family in a family, in the education as important and taken.
My grandfather was his time.
One of a couple of provinced province Afghanistan. He's been created by his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my father -- my father.
My basically, but I was borders, but teachers.
That's what it's.
Two years ago, they went to the rhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here's the first time -- the first in his family, who ever recognition.
For him, it was sound that his children would be a children, also his children, also his daughter, trots the taliban, trots all risks.
He looked like a much bigger risk of his children don't go to school.
I know that I know that I'm in the years, sometimes, sometimes the talibanched by our lives, from our lives, from our lives and the perspective.
I had good loss to give me. But my father said, "Thather, you can hear. You can lose your life.
No money can be carbon. You can be in war. You can be done in the war.
But a thing is going to be done, you're always going to be here, and even if we have to do with our blood for your blood for your blood for your skills, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to still you still want to still?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country on a country that was destroyed by war.
Less than 6 percent of my alters have a higher than 6 percent of my alters as the secondarch, and when my family, and when my family, I would have a slightly being a women.
Instead, I'm going to stand here as a states of the Middlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather, my grandfathered by his family, because he was sended to school because he was a greater to school, one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first.
He doesn't just talk to my high schools, but also, I also was the first woman, and I was the first woman who was fulled him with the car.
My family believe me.
I have great trees, but my family has greater animals,
So I'm a global bothers for 1010, a global bottom of women.
So I've got to green, SOLALA, and maybe some internative internative in Afghanistan, a land, a country, a land, a country, in the schoolbook.
It's wonderful to see how the schools with my school with great leadership with great earness chances.
And to see how their parents and variously for them, like my parents, as I'm going to do my parents and decided everybody's destroying.
So as Ahmed. That's not his name and I can't show your face, but Ahmed is the father of my father.
And a months ago, his daughter and he's on the home of SOLA in their village, and they're the tissue of the streets at the streets.
When he was home, he came up with the phone and a voice and a voice, he would be sended up his daughter, they would try to school.
And he said, "The said, "The I want to be able to do that, but I'm not going to set up my daughters, I'm going to set up and overlock."
What Afghanistan, so I've got something that I've got something that's going to be able to do is going to be able to see the excused by us, the father that the walls of us, and the walls, and the father, and the expects.
That's not today that our mothers don't have a little bit of the success.
Thank you are harders that are the people who are able to reflective and think about a lot of future, and they're going to be a lot of their treatment. But in a society like the infghanistan is the uncomfortable.
On the Taliban went to school, just few hundreds of girls -- because it was illegal.
But today, every time in Afghanistan, over three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how we're looking at the same change.
I'm notice that the change of daughters, and I'm going to change the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I'm going to look at my school, and their parents, and their parents that they're going to make a lot of parents that they're going to make a lot of future and a lot of future and a long-termany forest and a long wall.
Afghanistan is for me to a country of hope and the uncomfortable opportunities, and it remember every day.
And as I think they have great trees.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, also, I was basically -- my life -- my life was in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1977 -- I see, I'm looking at Sambia, but I've in Sambia, Cenia, the Ela, Algeria, Algeria, Algeria, and Somalia, with African countries.
I've worked for a laboratory and every single project that we've been standing on the legs,
I was sent to do.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're going to be good work in Africa list in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we're all states.
Our first project, what my first project, which is my first book "Ripples inspired inspired, one that we wanted to show you whales the people who want to show up the sambias.
We came with Italian Saatgut in South America, in this to sambia, which is to the Sambia, which is leading to the Sambia. We lived the animic population and tales.
Of course, the answered the an interesting thing about it, so we didn't have interesting them for the work, and sometimes they're doing it.
We were amazing that there was no country in a such analographics.
But instead of asking why they didn't look at the simply "God since we're here!"
"Gerade to return the people to return the people to return the prediction."
Of course, all wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, we had these practice. In Italia, they were so big, in Sambia.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Shouse, like simple landwirt."
When the tomata, and red red, came from 200 night, about 200 night-foots and flew all.
We said to the Sambiern: "Oh God, the Nilpfering!"
And they said, "Yes, we have no country, we don't have a country."
"Why didn't say that?" "I've never asked us."
I thought, we were so greater in Africa, but then I saw what I saw what the Americans made what the Americans made the Englands, which was made the financials.
We felt like the networks.
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainly, because we don't look at the beginning of African people.
They should be the book "Thead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambic economic economic economic economy.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have the countries have the African continent 1.5 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been telling you.
Let's just give her book.
Let me give you a African, which we have angered.
We're affordable people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two kinds of people, like we're patrize them or we're patriarch.
Because words are strong by latinic woman, which means "Vather" means "Vather."
But they have two different conditions.
Patriarchalic: I'm going to treat any other culture, as if they were my children. "I love my children.
Patronizing: I'm going to treat any other culture, as if they were my dyings.
That's white people in Africa, "bwana," Chef, Chef, Cheful.
I was after that when I was a book called "Small" by school," he said, "Smaller," he said, everything in the economy when people don't want to leave them in Ruhead.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is Respe.
Today, the morning of the heart of the conference that conference, a stab, and asked a stab, "Can you're going to make a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react on people, and he's going to react a system called a system that never motivated in the nobody will never be able to reactive, but you're going to be distribution, but you're going to hear the distribution of the pionarying pionarying p
What you do -- you're doing -- you're going to be the mouth.
You never never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're going together with the individuals.
We don't work from books.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Caf."
We don't have infrastructure.
We flying friends and find out what the person wants to find what the person wants to find.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can someone else a idea.
If these person don't like this?
The passion for the own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own growth is the most important thing.
We help them to find the knowledge that can never be able to find anyone.
The person with the idea hasn't know the knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this instead of statt instead of community and people say, why do we want to say why do we hear them? But not in community? But not in community.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
Internet have never been part of the neverage, and they're never going to say what they want to do with their money to see what they want to see.
Planation has this blind flow.
The clearly people who are cleaning, you don't know because they never metabolic trees.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, it has to be social infrastructure that don't existed.
A new business has to be created.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedroom, who's in the house, your cover, and in the cover, you're sitting you help you to find your passion, your lifetime, your lives information.
I have this in food, West-Australia, trying to try to do this.
I promoved to the time and trying to decided to decided to decide where we should do what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had the first year and I had the first three days of my first customers, and I half of my first customers, he was morixed him. I half a restaurant. I half a restaurant.
I half these fishers, and I'm going to work and these wonderfish thunks to a fish in Albany for 60 cents, but for 60 cents, but for 150 center for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I do something very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
I hold the mouth and highly high."
So -- -- so -- so the government: "Make it again."
We've done it in 300 community.
We've got 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go on an insight.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the best companies, story, a few years ago.
Peter pressure was Philosophy pressor, before he was businessed with companies. Peter said, Peter said, Peter said, planeter said, in fact, inevitable with an uncomfortable and economy."
Planation is the death of the company of the company.
So you build Christian to know what the clouds are the most covery crime, with their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get to a bring.
You have to give them the discretion and privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people before, the intelligence and the people?
So what presentation have you learned at most of the most morning?
<unk>romic, empty people. The eating people.
I want to say that the companies of the right way, the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- northrowing fossil fossil fuels, fully, and suddenly, there are systems that are not sustainable.
The constraction is not aftermashine is not sustainable.
The Freon-Aron-Ariving is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we have to look at the billion people on the sustainable ways to recognize, transporting to correspond to them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who is this technology for the green revolution? Universities? We're going to be food!
The government? Is you're going to be.
It's going to be invision. And they're going to do it.
I read a future story in a future of a future of many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were eing in the future of the future of the city of New York in the year of New York in the year.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happens in 100 years, with the city of New York, the city was a security: The city: The city: The city is not existing in 100 years.
Why? You saw the curve, and they said, and they said, if the population in this tempoint in this tempoints, they needed to stop the people to listen to people who are impossible to millions of six millions of six millions of six millions.
Because they went to the mistake.
At 1860, they see the bad technology that life looks like New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, 19001, there were 1001 Automobilically -- 1001.
The idea that I had made another technology had done the renew, and there were little fabrics in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with companies.
And when he's got to be able to get the discussion.
One of them, they don't come and talk to you.
So when you have to recover them together, engaged and living invice.
Then you have to recover the absolute truth over the companies.
From the little bit of the biggest company, all of the country, three things out: The three things: The firm of production, the consumer that have to be able to be able to behavios, and the financial.
Rather?
We never met a single person who can make a little person who can make something produce a little bit of the money can care the money.
That's not what's not exist.
This person was never born.
We have researchers and we've been looking at the 100 iconic firms of the world -- Carnegie, edison, Fording, Fording, Fording, Google, Yahoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed all of the world's allowed companies of the world, only one: No one person, just one person.
Now, we're going to live 16-year-old in Northumbers and we started the first time to give them the first two side of Richard Branson Autobiography Branson Autobiography. The first 16-year-olds of the first 16-olds.
No one time, "ich" and 32 times "wir."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody's a company of all. No one company. Nobody.
So can we make a community, in the average that will have a little bit of the painting a little bit of the memory, and your bars, your engaged caf<unk>s going to do what someone is going to do with this guy who's talking about this guy who's talking about this guy.
What can you make? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you record on the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't you." "Mo young young you?"
We activate generate communities.
We have groups of freedoms that can be services that are going to students in the middle of the middle of the middle and people have found that the wonderful population of the intelligence of the economy of the economy of the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be like it, alice, alice in the wounds.
The Penn State University bather -- a dociation -- a dotication -- attack in communications -- to explore in communications.
I had angry --
It's right now. Angster. Angstone with their great brain and their great books and their great books and their books.
But as the conversation, he developed me how Alice, it was like alice as age, as they were going to look at the cannin, and a door to a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like my face when I was leading with the students. I was amazing about the thought they had to discovered that they had this wondered that other words.
I think that turns to open this door, it means that it's great certain communication.
We need to make unbelieved in our communication of our scientists and engineering the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the biggest problems that our greatest problems, like, energy, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and then I don't think it's not going to believe in our consciously.
But these great faces are not coming to understand our scientists and engineers and engineering us in their wonderful.
So scientists and engineers and engineering us.
I want to show you a few an example of how to make it, how you can see that the science and the technology and the technology, with their technology and spanted to know that the technology and spanted.
The first question that you have to ask us to be answer, is, and?
Says us, why we're just a scientific scientific buildings so relevant for us.
If you don't just suggests, but also tells us that their draws us that their draws that their dracture in our cooks, because they're important to understand the Eastope, because they can understand the Eastope.
And if you're going to be what you do, then you're going to be able to do.
Faches are a heart of learning, for the constants.
Sure could be used to be able to use it, and then, why doesn't say, "Raum," and why doesn't really understand what much changed for us?
Our thoughts to make simple, is not the same as their nive looks like their nive.
How an amazing thing said, "Make the things like this, but not just as possible -- but not just as possible."
You can tell us something about you, something about you know, you know, you know, without knowing without the compromise without the compromise.
A few things are going to be returned to bring stories: Instance, stories and analogies. It might be able to turn it into your banned.
And if you're working on your work, then you read the story of the story.
Have you ever asked her, why it's "Stichpunct"?
What happens when someone is going to make someone else? All right? One is going to be able to do with these points.
A following how this is not just slowly, but also too much, but also too much on the language of our brains and dad, we're going to fast.
These example of geneview of Geneview is much we're much we showed that the special structure of the trabelly is so stable to the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration of the effect of the effect.
The terrick here is a single simple sentence, just to use the audience, when it's audience, if it can lose the audience, orients, orients, the other senses, and the other senses of our senses and graphically changing our senses.
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these door and the wondering and the wonderful and the technology and the technology in business.
And the engineers I've been strong, I've been reading to me, with the <unk>Nerd in me."
So, in fact, the science of science, and eureditors are able to share this through the relevantage, so that's important, and that's important, and multiplicated the human beings that you're incredible, and it's incredible. And it's unbeliety evantly unb
So scientists and engineering, if you're going to have this same thing, clearly unbed me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy cancer a cell phone in Syria.
With a handy can tweet a news and a protestail and a protestail.
And with a handy can take a long time, you can take a low-cloud and basically.
All this is possible.
I'm a year 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people who went to change the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989, and we're going to imagine that people who have changed on the cell phone, a handy in the task.
Who is a handy has a handy?
Half the half.
Halest you hold your hands, you hold them!
Half a bubble. One Android, a blackberry, wow.
These are many. Fast everyone has a hand.
But today, and my hands talk about me and my life, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
This is 350 ciles of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U. Commission is a reline.
This is called Right is called Right is reline to the front of the reline.
This reline is that every particularly in Europe, every part of the Internet, every internetdia, every internet country, a bandbreaking Europe, a bandbreaker.
Who is it? Who is it? Who is a email?
Who is a sentence?
And if you use a handy benefits where you're using.
All these information are going to be six months to two years to two years of your telephone, or your Internet or your Internetanbiety or your Internetanbield.
And everywhere in Europe, people have said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to."
They said, we wanted to do this idea of recording.
We want to sense self-based on the digital time and we don't want to be the telephone and Internet, and internet, all of these information about us species.
There were answers, Journalists, Preece, Preece, who said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to want."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of blinds and said, "Freekness."
And some of those said, this could be town town town stasi 2.0.
The stasi was the secrets in Ostdexism.
And I asked me, if this really works.
Can you really know, all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone, I asked my phone, the distinction that was the largest parts that were the largest part of the greatest telephone, and I asked her information, and I asked me told me about me.
And I asked them, and I asked them, and they didn't get a right answer. Nururur Eurvent.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is protocollated.
So I decided to do a generalism, they wanted to have a bad because I wanted to have this information.
But the definitely, the definitely, we're going to give this information.
At the end of the end of a compare with them.
I'm going back to the anclassion where they all send me all of the information.
Because in the fundamental fundamental requirement of the emotion of the emotion of the eye of the eye of the right research.
So I recognize this half-dollapse environment with a cD.
And on the CD was this:
350 ciles information.
First, I saw it, and I said, it's half a huge date. My date.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this dateift.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I start?
Because you see where I'm going to look at where I'm going to do.
But then I said, I want to go to the information of the publicity.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show you what's going to show you what is means.
So with time opened, and open Data City, so I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reinceooms and radiooms, you can pull back and back.
You can make every step, I can do, after I do.
And you can see how I can see from Frankfurt with the stuff with the stuff, and how many ants I do different antrible.
All of this is possible information.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just like, I'm like my wife and we talked me, and we talk about a few mal with each other.
And then I called a few friends and they call a couple of friends.
And after a while you and you're going to take this huge communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they can go to the time they go to the country, they go to bed.
You can see all.
You know, you know, you know, the central figures, about who are the leaders of the groups.
If you have to do this information, you can see what the society.
If you have to connect the information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect evolution of how to make a society about how to reday, because you know who you're going to talk to you who're going to be a email, everything that's possible when you have to do this information.
And these information are going to be months of months, in Europe to 2 years.
How do I remember, we asked that all these people in the streets in the streets in 19899 Handys in their tasks.
And the stasi, who had been wonstration of the demonstration of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state that would never happened.
The case of the blinder magic magn't have any states.
And also, not the case of the case of the ice.
Because today is stategentures and companies like many information, like they want to know how they can do about us, online and often, online and often.
They want to have the opportunity to have our lives, and they want to be long long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long
But even self-based and a life in the digital time, no wider's not a wider.
But everyone has to be able to do for the self-based for the self-dime.
You have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you go home, you're going to go home of the 21st century of the 21st century.
If you go home, you're going to go home, just because companies and state companies, and state the opportunity to species, they have to specifically not doing it.
And if you don't think you're asking your phone, you've been thinking about the information that they've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you use your handy, you remember the self-bestime, you have to build the digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoes, snellite cellres, bridge.
So the city planer doesn't meeting and overlegral South Central South Central to change something else, they change it in South Los Angeles, as if that something that changes the city of what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituoes, snakes, snellress, bridge.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the central Los Angeles, the drive-thrus and the Drive-thrus and the Drive-bys.
The comic is that the drive-thrus more people, more people are killed than the Drive-bys.
People are south Central Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The father is in my fourth is crazy is quite higher than about five males of hills, which is about 15 kids, which is about 15 kilometers.
I couldn't go to the more withans.
And I asked me how you feel like you would feel like you'd have to healthy food, if you could have a mal, if you go out of the house, the negative eative expectations that have the best expectations that have been looking at your food system.
I'm going to buy the rule of the role and sells like buyings.
I see the dialysecial setting like Starbucks like Starbucks.
And I started to stop that this is what we need to stop.
I capture that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no losing more than 45-minutes, I had no losing to get a pesticy to get a pestician in the presence in present.
So I started a food for a food for my house.
It's a piece of land, we call Parklage.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing that's the city of the city.
But you have to start to do it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is because it's my responsibility and I have to go to the stand up."
And I decided to hold it in standing.
So I got my group, and I got my group, the LA. Green reason, and we started together, and we started to pulling my food, soon, soon, so that all of the program, so that all the program.
We're a kind of imagination, we're going together from Garden, and we're going to be social signs and all the city of the city, and everything we do, and everything we do, is costless.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else.
The city came up and he came up and he told me and said that I had told me that I had told my garden, I had to be a huge amount of a huge.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A richeral anticipation of foods of food, a piece of food, which is real reality?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herman."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times, Wind, Wind Lopez Lopez Lopez, and talked about it, and talked about the city and talking about the city of Green Brazil, and they were able to change a petition.
We hold the hands.
My city rather rather than that they said they're supporting and said that they're doing what we do.
So why should they do that?
LA.A. has in the United States, most of the city of the city of the city.
They're bringing 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flowerful to power to plants.
Why would they find the television?
And by the animal is a plant of a plant, you know,000 sames.
With green bohs in the werts of a dollars and you have own own value of 75 dollars.
It's my home, I say, I say that they should be building their own food.
His own food is like your own money is like your own money.
Look, I have a consumption in South Central.
I'm going to stand up there. I have my sons.
And I'm sured me, part of this before this, part of the other people who were fabricians, and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I please my art.
Graffiti-known artists, the walls, the walls, I beautiful, I'm going to beautiful plane.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of piece, and the pieces are my relationships for these struggle.
They would be surprised what the Earth can use it as a country when you use it as a line.
You can't imagine how it's a sunlume is a sunlume is, and how they make people.
So what happened?
I've experience, like my garden to a instrument for the expanding of my food.
To do the community to change the community of the bottom of the bottom.
We're the bottom.
They would be wonderful as kids are going to be confluenced.
Garden is the therapistic and coastic and coast, especially, especially with the city.
And then you know, you're going to get expression.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30s, and I got out in my garden, and I got out of my garden, and I came out.
I've been sleeping me, because they were there because they were there, and I said, "Wis you don't have to do it.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been looking at me when I saw people were so numbers, and I've been able to do it, and that's what I said, "Fin, people asked me, "Fin, you're not angry, you're not going to be able to food."
And I said, "Thum teach, no, no, I don't know what they're not angry.
And it's the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it back to her health."
At a different time, I was a garden in this obdddle of LA.
These are the guy who have helped me to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how it has been confluenced with their mother and how they've done with their mother and their grandmother and it was greater, and it was to see how it changed for a moment.
Green reason is about 20 gardens, about 20 garden.
To our environments, so 50 people, and they didn't have freedom and they're all freedom.
If kids carbon, it children.
If they came to tomates, they eata.
But if they don't get it to get it, if they don't getting the food and body eating and body eating them, they're blind, they're always food.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work in this thing, but they're going to stand up in this thing -- I see the same kids who are just going on the pad, and the northwhere, and the nirds.
The gardens, I see a opportunity where we can train these kids can train to care their communities to care their communities.
And if we do that, who know who know who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carverton Carverage.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Edbots, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plane. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole wanted to garden plants where people can share the same flocks in the same flock.
I want to take schoolscontainer and they take them into health caf<unk>s caf<unk>s.
So you don't understand me.
I don't talk about costless snow, because it's not sustainable.
The comics is that you have to behavior is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about people, people working to give people from the streets of the streets, and they read the streets and the earth, if you're going to leave your own food, and if you look at the corner and if you look at the barmarkets.
So what I want to do here is to do here.
I want to be able to all the ecological rebelling, Gangster, Gangster-garden.
We have to start the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger.
You're going to buy with 'n't you get to sell?
And let's get the weapons of your eurer choice.
If you want to make meeting with me, you don't want to do in the counting stage, and if you want to do a meting and a meeting, where you want to talk about what you're talking about it.
If you want to make meet you want to get your sellow, you can go to my garden, so we can use any single slow.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite slowly in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No," is unfortunately politicians."
Although in 19th century in 19th century, a better definition, "Ein Snollygoster is someone who is someone who is a couple of parian, which is an independent of pariatrics, program or line, and his regramating the regram of power.
I don't have a similar," is.
Something with World, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians that they have to control the language.
One 171, for example, the British Parlament, the British Parlament, time not the skin.
And that was actually back to the mutual named a man with the extraordinary names Brass Crosby, who was on the Parlament.
She was him in the Tower of London and lon, but he was a mutonitous enough, he was mutig enough enough to reach enough, and he had so much difficult to be so much difficult to london, he was so much difficult.
And just a few years later, we find the first next night, we're going to believe the sentence "so strong.
Brasses are related to the English word for bad.
But that's not true. It's about a returned on a pressor of press.
But to show you how we're going to show you how we're going to take you to the United States, I want to take you to the United States, as they're just reached the unprepreciate the unpreciousness.
You saw the question of question, how you should call George Washington, the state of the state.
You know, you didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a republic nation?
It was in Congressed in Congressive.
And there were all kinds of possible for all kinds of possible.
I mean, some people want to call him Gouvernor Washington, and other son, and other sounds, and other setton, and other people who are recording to the freedom of America of America.
Not so a present.
Some people want to call it a nice clear.
They thought that's while.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king of time.
It would have function.
But everyone was indeed indeed, because this drawing 3 weeks, because this drawing 3 weeks.
I've got the days of a senators who stands, the stranger, "Immerically the same is the same same is the same same is the same same is the same same.
The reason for the reason for the longer and the longer, that the representation was the senat.
The representants didn't want to do that what's going to do. They wanted to do it. They didn't want to do it.
Canighten, and they're going to take it on ideas to be able to make it.
They wanted to the most famous, the most painting, youngest title, who give them a little bit of them.
This title was "President."
President. They didn't existed the title. He was removed. But he was a slightly a valuation.
That's how the idea of a jury.
He had no longer than the reason, "Att's called "Auff.
Sometimes, there were president little colonial general community and governments, but it was really an indeed title.
That's why the senating him.
They said, "That's lowerful, you can't call it President.
This closed together, and this is available and fromlands and citizens.
Who gets him, if he's going to take a thumbs like President of the United States of America?"
And also after 3 weeks, the satenates didn't think about 3 weeks.
Instead of the minds of the title of the title of the title of the middle of the markets, but they wanted to make it away from their own powerful restrate.
You can learn three interesting things.
First, I think, and I've been able to find out, I didn't have anyone who's ever been able to find the title president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just just the title. He was just about it.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government is that something temporary -- then you were 223 years later, you know, you're going to be 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important point, is the most important point is that the title of the United States of America," is not so much more soldiers, right?
This has been able to do something more than 5,000 nuclear possible for the largest volced volcuits of the world and a flottes and a floth of the world and this whole stuff.
It's really a story of the title of the title of the title.
And so this is the end of the end of the end of the end.
They have a respectables of title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of events -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to sound like the climbs with the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the senat and the representat and the representing, because nobody's never felt that you're going to feel that you're going to be the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take me and with the idea.
Politicians trying to use the reality to make the reality to control the reality and reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, the reality of reality.
Thank you.
So I came in a laster with about 50 rebelling campaigns to Dralabad -- a 19-year-old surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'd like my bad converse converse Halby country, a pairs and country, and country in regulation of the government of governments that I couldn't see if I couldn't see a country.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was written with the war, all the new pyjama-Partys and football physics and footballs and footprints and fear-old states and religionalistic southern-state-stronic service.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm going to stand here, we've got afghane, Southeast Afghane, atheist and atheist and a radical politized artists, the last nine years in Afghanistan, and we've been working on the last nine years.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do is doing things about the art, but I couldn't make a personality. I want to make artificial art, and I want to make the personality and cars and cars and cars and cars and cars.
I want to spend a day in life in life of a decision of a drawing carbon, the communists like <unk>Popstarling" a popstarling" and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's going to do is the distance of the Drangster, as a parlament and a choice and a choice and a choice, "Well, I'm going to do with the Slogan: I'm going to talk."
And try to use these campaign to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosiosio.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan on the ground, and I'm going to go back to the reason, and you know, as a policy of the corruption of the cables of cars, but in the streets of cars and cars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan of my mind, I think about the "modical conflict.
The war and the war and the free-down answered with him, and we came up with a new environment for style and models that you can only a model that you can only a model for settlection of sky and self-dime-forded in the cell phone of the faster.
And I would like to see how a simple simple schools between Kabul between Kabula, and it's appell of 1899999, today, today, and they're going to create their windows of the earth of the early <unk>Donics.
But for all of these things, you can get in prison, they can be missed, they can be missed.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to lose the geography of self-low.
That's my favorite?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I worked as a model.
Second years, just like 10 years.
I have the feeling that now is now in the space here in the space, because I would have a unexpected this cleothes.
And finally, I've got something to do something for the way.
This is the first time you're the first time you're going to see someone on TED stage, so you can see, so you can see.
If you were really excited to say, when I was really excited to say that, you don't need to say that I'm going to twitter.
I also found that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds, because I can change what you think about 10 seconds.
It doesn't have anyone.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good, it's good, I wanted to send them.
The worst part of the most part is to cover the pullover, because then you'll be able to get me out of my head, so long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as a sm.
In place.
Why did I do that?
That was possible.
Well, it wasn't so picture like this image.
One is a powerful, but a image is also operating.
I've just going to change your minds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never really never been a friend.
I felt very unfortable and the photographed me, I said, I'm going to be able to leave my hair in the hair.
And then, from operations or the false or the wrong breaks that I had two days for the work that I've been very few massive opportunities, and our own possibilities, and our own quite, and our own life is unlike.
It's to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
And I stand up on this book, because I'm a model.
I stand up on this book, because I'm a hot, because I'm a wife, and in my branching, we call this sexy girls.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How are you going to have a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh," but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, a model, a violence and maybe you're going to ask you, and maybe you're going to ask you.
Well, in the last few centuries, we've been beauty and young and young and young, and young, we're going to be biological programmed, but also, as biological programmed, but also highly highly highly.
This experience was created for me. And it's a same for me.
I know there are people in the audience, people who are at this point, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liuan Smalls. Liuy.
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to leadership.
But I have to tell you that in 2007, that in 2007, a very large in 2007, the NYU.U all models on the line, every time, every time, every single time, and that was booked by 767, and that was only 27 percent or less than 27 percent or less than 27 percent of them were just four per
The next question that I'd always going to believe me, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm going to grow up?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls really want to give you a little girls?
You know what? You can be? You can be all going to be.
You can be president of the U.S. or the United States or the next Internet or a nine-Herzine, or a ninja-Dichter, which is irrrregal, because then you're going to be the first."
If they still telling this greater, "No, no, no, no, no, I want to say, "Well," I want to say, "We're going to say, "We're going to say, "We're going to say, "Well,"
Because I don't have a responsibility for the coast, the Chefredible or the American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next side of H<unk>amp;Meisel.
To say, you want to be a model, you want to say that you're going to say that you want to say that you want to win the lotto the lotto.
You can't related it, and it's almostic and it's not a career.
Now, I want to give you 10 years ago, I want to know about 10 years, because of the other than history can be surely different than harder.
If you have a photographer, and that's just like a nice, and the counter streets, and the century, and then we want to put a photo in the light, and then you want to go to the legs, and then you go to the poor, and then, that's going to go back to the point.
It looks like this.
Hopefully more communicately than the middle.
That was .... I don't know what's happened.
If you're going to look at the school and a life, and a few Jobs, you can't live in a lot more, you can't say that you want to say that you want to be a lot of the U.S., but you want to go to the United States, "10 years ago.
The next question that means, the next question is, "Who's retuss?"
And yes, so pretty much fotos are retuse, but this is just a little part of the story.
This is all the most photo, I made this is what I did, and that was the first time I had a biciniode. I had a biciniode. I hadn't even my piode.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girls.
So I just saw a few months ago, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm on the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is me on a pyjama Party, a few days ago, a few days ago,
This is what I'm in the football and in V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
It's constructs and it's construction of a group of profis, from Haurylists and meters and photograps and stylists and stylists and stylists and structure that I'm not construction.
Okay, when next thing you ask me, people always asking me, "Cever you want to make things?"
Yes, I've been able to many 20-cm-Abs, which I never met approach, but the things I've never getting things that I've never getting things that I'm going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, and one day, I went to a launch of my money, and you gave me the clear.
When I found my friends with my friends with my friends, and they were a red fluid, and of course, we were able to do a redrate, and of course, "It just a high-fraiding," and we could further.
I have this cost of my costs, I've got my exception, and not because of my personality and there are people who are going to look at their personality and not knowing their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 parts of the last year, and I filtered in the last year, 85 percent of the latinos and latinos and latinos and latinos and most of young men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men and Latinos, for the question, "Who I'm going to ask myself?"
So, "How do I'm going to start? When I'm going to start?
And in my rights for those talks for these talks about this talking about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of their body in the United States, and these numbers, and these numbers, and these numbers are 178 percent,
The last question is, "How is it, how does it be a model?"
And I think they're going to expect these answer: "If you're going to be a little bit of hairls and believe you, you feel very happy and fabulously happy and fabulously happy."
And Backstage we give a answer that maybe this early maybe this early.
We say, "It's really great, so much to reisflective, and it's greative people inspired people."
All right, but it's just the skull of the story that we never had never been before the camera, which I never said, "I feel like the camera, I've never said, "I feeling me."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think about my exception.
And if you ask you ask, "What's happy if I thinally thins, if I had longer legs and believe?"
Then you should make a few models, because they've got the thinest basic legs and the most coolest coolest coolest coolest coolest coolests and they're the most extraordinary women on the planet.
When I was a very difficult to do this talk about this talk, I've been very difficult to me, because I felt a real piece of a sense of a sense of a very unfortunately, "I got to say, "I got to say, "I'm going to be able to say, "I've got to my grandfulful." And I was a
It was very difficult, a very difficult, a repression of until weight and races often when I was one of the greatest nutrition of the greatest nutrition of it.
But I'm also happy and felt like I've been here, and I've been here, and I've been here, and I've been here before 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, and my career, and my career, because I wouldn't be a sense of my career, because I wouldn't be a felt like my careerally.
If you take out of this talk about this talk, then you hopefully that we all recognize the power of the irregness and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never been able told my grandmother never been able to figure out in the exils of life, "Son," is, "Son,"
But who never never been like a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the liby running revolution of the same revolution of the waves of the massive of the massive of the massive of the egyptical revolution.
I spent too much other libyers, inside and a half and except to start a day of the Zorn and a tag of the corn and to start a revolution of the tyrannian Regime Gaffis.
And there was a great revolution.
Junge, liby women and men and men in the first rest of the first rest of the regime, hold slogans of the freedom, and social generality, and social generality.
They've got aware muthority of mutal diversity by the brutal dictatur Gaddafism.
They have a strong sense of sense, farm, from the farmers, until the farm.
Finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 toats, and almost 50,000 toxes, and the tyran and the Tyranians and the Tyranians.
But Gaddafi has a great big big business, a conversation of the Tyrannei, the corruption and the reason for course.
Four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannic Regime sowooth the Infrastructure, as the moral structure and the moral structure of the lybical society.
The consumption and the challenge and the challenge, I asked how many other women, I as many other women who are recording to record a civil society. We're going to do a dangerous and national experience and national experience.
So to 200 organizations were during and unmediately, and until the case of the case of the case of the case of the case, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in the exil, I got back to Lybia, and I started to Lybia, I started went to the topicshopshopshopshopshopshopshops and leadership and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I women, I women's the women, a movement of women, a movement of women, fearing from women, the goal of women, the goal of the strength of the strength of the women.
And in the idea of the paid I met a very difficult environment, a switch that's always stronger politics. A environmental politics of Dominan Politics of Dominan and explained.
I live an initiative of peace and femaled a libyer women, and I'm going to make a laws, a laws, a laws, each basically with women, and that's going to give the rights and country and country and country to country and country and country and count
At the end of our initiative, and he's successful.
Women women 175 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice of the first choice.
But long, but it's long, the euphory of the euphory of the whole number of the whole day, we waiting to news.
One morning, we went to the melditors of change and suffering and Sufi.
Another morning, we got news about the morning of American bothers and the angriffs on the message.
At another morning, the efficients were the army of officience.
And really, every day, we're going to look at the milize of the milize and their others and their own power and their opportunities and their power and their face.
Our society, we've been involutionary mindship, polarism, polarized by the ideal and principles of the ideal and principles, social generality, social generality,
Intolerance, extraordinary and Raches were the icones of the Iconclusion.
I'm not here today today today with the successful story of our reversion of our reversion.
So I'm a lot of today today, as a nation that we've been able to have a national choice and the wrong decisions.
We've been able to do our priorities.
Because the choice of the number of peace or signity or signity in Lybia.
Hat the reversion of the river of lists and the white between female and men and national wars and national female values?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why is our society is going to continue our society and dominated by self-f-f-folitics of the dominance and the exception of men.
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been the only female, but the female women's female of the middle of the middle of the slight.
Our society needs a national dialog and consumption, as they bring the choice as they've burned the end of the end of the end of the end of two polarization and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative conversation of the female of the female, quantitative conversation of the female.
We need to stop in the name of the corning and a day of the roach of the roach of the roach.
We have to start to start in the name of the middle and the grandch.
We have to develop a white distribution that wouldn't just going to be able to do it, but also too, but also together, the rather than the river, collaboratton collaboratory, approach.
These are the ideal that Ialth crime, the ideal lybia lybia to make peaceface.
Because the peace has an alchemic and in this alchemics, and it's about the femines and masculines and maskulin sweets.
This is the real reverse of river.
And we have to existence we have to do it, before we do it sociopolitical.
After a visit from the Koran "Salam" -- Freeks," the word of the word of the words, radio."
The word "dradition" again, all of the abraditional traditional translates, this same as the word "srabic Wortrahembic word "mbolismbolismbolized the whole personal female of humanity and the humanity of humanity, and the humanity,
And just like the mother's the embryo, the embryo, completely, it's so nutrition of the middle of the middle of the entire existence.
That's why we said, "My Gnade, everyone's all things."
That's why we said, "My Gnade," he said, "My grand."
So we're going to be the grands of the grands.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country, and I went to the low "Nothing with the lowest.
And I was very stold.
In school, we're going to see the story of Kim Il-Sion, but we learned a lot about the world, except that America, South America, South America, South America, our fine.
I'm often asked me how the eye is, I thought I thought, I thought my whole life in North Korea, until away.
And they saw years, I saw a public having a public head, but I thought my life in North Korea sei.
My family wasn't poor, and I had never had to live.
But in 1995, my mother broad, my mother, from the sister of a collegin.
Darin stood: "If you're going to lead our families are not going to be five families, because we don't have two weeks.
We love together on the ground and our body are so difficult to live."
I was so hard.
I heard the first time, I heard that people in my country.
I went to the bottom on the bahnhof and looked at something that I can't get anymore.
A lived woman woman on the ground, and a absolutely hidden in their arm, and a half of his mother.
But no one of them, because all of them, because all of them were so that they were able to care their families, and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a great hunger in North Korea.
At the end of North Koreaner's been falling on the opener of the open, and many more overlights, because they only reasons, and many more reasons and basically.
In the case, the strangerous, so that's been sitting on me, so that's been able to the light of China on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the side of the Ufers.
I always asked me why they had there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite satellite of North Korea and his neighbors.
This is the flow of the aircracy of the border of the border of North Korea and China and China.
As you can see the flow of the flow of the river, and he's very size north Koreanern Coreanern Coreanern Corean.
But many of them.
Sometimes, I saw people in the river.
I can't say much about how I can left North Korea, but I can say that I can say that I can tell you that I've been able to change China.
I thought I thought I was a short time of my family,
I would never have never thought that it was 14 years together.
In China was very hard to live as a young girls without family.
I had no idea of how the life as a north Korean flying, but I would be a northern, but I wouldn't just extremely hard to be very difficult, but also, it's very hard. Becored, because it's an illegal.
So I lived in strangerous, Identity, Identity, and you would have to fly in a bad sicks, and you would send me back to North Korea.
One day, my greater alptraum was true when I was biggered by Chinese police and in the police and in the police.
Somebody remember, North Koreanerinese, so they did my chinese countries and asked me to tell me about my chinese questions.
I had this kind of angry, I thought my heart, I thought my heart.
Would anything eventually, I could be read, I could be either, I could be represent and absolutely.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I was able to control my life, but I felt my feelings and repeating the questions.
After they were finished with the example, he said, "That was a false.
It's not North Korean."
And she was like me. It was a wonderful.
Some North Koreanerans, in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had great happiness.
Although they were related, they were finally free, they were free international pressure international pressure.
This North Koreanerins didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, in China, in China, in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be able to represent or public, either.
Although I had lucky, I had lucky, it's much other north Koreaners didn't do that.
It's tragic that North Koreanerans are their identity and hard to colds and hard to cold.
And so she found a new language, and worked in a new language, can be done in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the last 10 years, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
Micha in South Korea nobody was a greater challenge, when I thought it was made me.
English was in South Korea so important that I had to learned my third language.
And I've got the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all coreaner, but inside our innoved, we've been very expanded by 67 years of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the piece of 67 years.
Identity a identity.
Bin I have South or North Koreanerin?
Where are I? Who am I am?
Pludes, there was no land more, that my home, that my home.
Although I had the anpassion of the southernic life didn't live a plan.
I'm already for the attack of the university.
And so I'd like to be my new life, I had a hard life, I got a bad.
The north Korean body, the money I found my family, and when I was sended my family, and when streets areased to a family, a country.
They had to fast as possible as possible, so I started to plan.
North Koreanerans have to be an incredible streets to their way.
It's almost impossible to required between North Korea, Ironically to China, Ironically to China and made me back to China and made me back to China and made me back to China.
Because my family doesn't have to talk about 2,000 miles, I had to live more than 2,000 miles through China and then after South Asia.
The business is a week, and we were more misded more almost almost.
One time when the business was a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the extraordinary and began to ask questions.
And my family doesn't have a chinese family, I thought they would be.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided told him, and he said that they were taught himself, and I would be since.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, he was happy.
We did it allowed it to the launch, but I had to be almost everything I had to border to border the limits of Laos.
But even though we had the boundaries of the boundaries, my family inhaft, because illegal green.
After I had money and snowed, and I had paid, my family had been family in a month, but my family was inside the main city of Losa.
This was one of the greatest rid of my life.
I had done all the family to family to free family, and we were so name, but my family was family, just the southern Coreanic Bothorean Bothorean Bothorean Bothorean Bothorean Bothanish Both.
I went back and found between the involved and the police and the police and trying to family, but I hadn't enough money, but I had no enough money or money or money or money or money.
I'm lost all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man who is losing?"
I was fully about this is a friend that a friend.
In broken English and with a words and with a words, I went to a bank, and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two northern North Korean, and two northern Corean, and two northern Core.
I thanked him from all of the heart and asked him, "Why do you help me?"
"I'm not help you," he said.
"I help the north Korean human people."
Mir was clear that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The first thing to come from free friends, for me to a new hope for me to a new hope that needed to take the North Korean, and he showed me the friends and the units of friends and the international community as the northern Northern Core.
Finally, after our longer reprise, my family, and I remained my family, but the freedom.
Many North Koreaner will be done by their families, and soon as they're going to come in a new country, they're not going to get money or not a money.
The international community can help us to help us in the education, the English, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the eye, because many of us are still in contact with families, and we're going to stay information and we're going to change the northern Corea, Northern Korea.
I had a lucky, so much hope and inspiration inspiration inspiration in my life, I hopefully north Korean, with international until the International until the International until.
I'm sure you're going to be a lot more successful North Korean, also, also on the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've just a bit of a bit.
I'm not saying that I'm not normal.
I want to imagine my bridge.
Remi is 22, big and very good, very good.
He can't talk to you, but he can't communicated freedom, like some of the best reder.
Remi know what love is love.
He's particularly expensive, and it's unknown.
He's not just a real. He doesn't experience.
He didn't know about religious differences and imagine, and imagine it's never telling a light.
If he looks like our childhood, when he was trying to remember the words that I remember, I remember a thing: how little bit about the consciousness, and how wonderful the uncomfortable.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He's an absolutely unfortable brain.
But he has a slightly a selective.
He can't remember my skills, and he remember my songs, but he remember the publicly, but he was remembered by any lower on my iPod, as he was fourth, as he was fourth of the most fourth of the most polities of my arrives.
Do they don't think about it?
But many people don't stimulate.
And in fact, because their understanding of the society of normal pasure, they're often, they're often, and they're often.
But what my heart is my heart and my sea, and my sea, although this was that the case was the case, even though they were not a similar to look at this, it was only a similar to be authorically -- extraordinary -- extraordinary.
Well, for the people who don't understand the same thing that doesn't matter with the conversation of the brain is a complex function of the brain, the social communication that social communication, and sometimes the social ability.
It's the same thing about every individual, it's a different, it's remium is different than Sam.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person autism of cars and even though it's one of the most fastest growth, there's no one of the world, there's no known association.
And I can't remember the first time I remember when I'm remember, but I can't remember, but I can remember it.
I was just three years old, when my brother when my brother, and I was so excited that I was so on my life.
And after a few months ago, he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and actually, in fact, and in fact,
Remi lived and regulated in his own world, with his own world, and he founds, and he founds like the little box, like, like, Autos in a cars in a series of the sky machine, which is what it's going to eat.
And when he was older, he was different, and the difference, and the difference.
But behind the wood and the fun and the fun and the funny, and the neverage of hyperactive, a really single nature, a junny, a junny, a junk, a junk of human beings, a human beings.
At the extraordinary.
Well, I can't learned that there was some of the moments in my family moments, moments, I wished that they were like me.
But I go back to the thought of the things that they've learned me to the idea that they've been able to understand the communication and love that these things I don't want to be able to do not be able to do not be a normality.
Normality about the beauty that beauty that the difference that we're going to give us that we're differently, that we're not going to be different.
It means that there's another way of rich.
And if I just to say a thing to Remi, and then you could say, and then you wouldn't be normal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, autistic or not, the difference we have a story that we have a story. We have a story in all of us, and in all earlier, and in all earlimative opened to Normality.
The chance on the size, forts and walls in the moment, in the moment, in the moment, like someone else.
Bitte -- you're not saying that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Docracted using editor, and neurosed to the project, with this photo on the photo on the project of a project, and with a million seconds of a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, and see the world doesn't see the world, but a million or a billion billion pictures per seconds.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography photography, a new education, a new education that they can make time in the lights of light in movement of light in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the absolutely buildings or notebrate a beautiful body in our body, and really, in our body, and really, really, what we can do with "Camera" and really question.
If I'm going to take a laser, and if I'm going to have a million south of seconds -- that's more female -- that's more female -- I'm a packet of Photon, and this is a millimeter, and this is a millimeter.
So if you take this project, this photones, this photones and take it into these flashion and how are going to behind these photones in the river?
How does light look like light?
So, this whole events --
So think about it, you think that all of the events, the whole events are less than a nanosecond -- so light, so light, and I need to return this stranger -- but I'm lighting this video to the factor 10 billion so that you can see the light.
Noca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, in this moviews very, so let me show you what's going on.
The puls, our project, our project, average in the flashets with a photonespaket, and that's start to move inside and the finally.
A part of the lights outside the table, and you see this experience of the waves.
Many of the photones of the photones of the last last last language and exploding in different directions.
As you can see, there's air flower that's in the flashion.
As you're breading to the waves on the table and white the reflexion of the reflexion of the reflexion of the focussion of the focuss.
If you take a <unk>uite project, and it's the same streets, and the video back to the video to the factor 10 billion people, know how long you have to see how long you have to see how long you have to see the film?
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long time, a very long film -- from a long-term, normal project.
And how do you see something stillle-fotography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table and the walls in the backgrounds.
It's like when you have a set of a teach.
I'm going to look like this, as a photo males, you know, some femto-B: but of course, of course, of course, of course, of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that when you'll see that if the lights, you're going to remove this further, you're going to be done.
Why is that? Because the tomate is reifying and the light in their lights and after a few seconds.
So in future, if these femto-camera in your camera in your camera, it might be able to be able to go into a supermarket, and you can go to a soul, whether it's rather than it's represent.
So how did my team at MIT this camera?
So when photographer, you know, if you're a photo with course, you have very little light light, but we've got very light, but we're going to have a billion times as your citizens, so you're not going to get a light.
So we do is, we're going to do this project, this photones, this photones, millions of synchronisation and recording to this gigabytes of data, and we've got to read this female, we've got to show you this female.
And we can take all these rhdates and doing things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can do that, but how would it be able to do with a new soul of souperties, can see eventually, to see eck?
The idea is that we're going to street up the door.
It's going to go back to the room, a part of it, a part of it, and then reflects back to the door, and we could reflect these more simplic actions of the lights of the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've built.
Links you see our femto-camera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to leave the current.
After our application in the "Nature Communication" was published by nature, it was from nature.cometications, and they have these animation.
We're going to get the light projects and they're going to be able to do this poton, and then we're going to be able to get the poton and some of the photones are going to be the first poton, and then we're going to reach the light and then reach the trees.
And because we have a camera, so fast is -- our faster, our femto-camera has some single camera.
It's a very good time to look at the world, and it can be the world in light.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the first objects, but we don't know what the points, but we don't know what the point.
Indeed a laser on the laser, we can see a roh-B: how do we see on the screen -- how they're looking at the screen, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they're trying together and trying together, and they're going to trying to make a light light?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a big thing to do is we can see the laboratory, we can use the practice, we could build the collisions that can be buildings and recognize what we can see in the curve, or we can see in the curve, or we can see in the light of light.
But because of the blood and building is very, of course, of course, which is really a way to think about female is a way to scientists, now, now, now, now, a newbotography female definitely, a new basically, the next generation of medication.
So, how do we can do is a scientists, even a scientist, is a scientist, and we can't have a artist, a artist of the ultraphy, and I realized that all these generabytes of data, and that we're not only knowing all of the science, we're not justice.
But it's happening here, something luster.
If you look at these waves under the flower, you see that the waves are moving from us.
The waves should be moving.
What happens here?
It turns out that we're almost in Light, because we've almost in light, and incredible effects, and astonishing incredibly.
The relationships, in the events in the world, in the world, he's going to happen in the camera in the camera, so you can relative relationships and time we can correction of space and time we can correctly correction.
So, if we're going to show the photography or the earth or the education of a new data, and we've got to recognition, we all have data, we all have data and data, we allowed to our ways.
It's about time. Thank you. Thank you.
There are many ways of our lives, like our lives.
We don't make any nightful to the street, so many ways, so many ways, but we're going to use this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and think about how applies and stuff, snowing, snowing and circules.
The projects from my questions, how much maybe my questions, how much might be my neighbors?
How can we stop more things, without us, without us?
How can we relate our expensive memory and leave the country and the country?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so that our communities, so that our communities and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea sea is going to be report of the hundreds of hundreds of years, the since hundreds of years, and tears, I'm going to talk about a city. I'm going to be able to musics.
I think every time, every time you never know, there's no one parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the city of the city.
I've been in the nice of this house, and I've been able to do it. I thought I thought I was going to change my life for everybody.
In 2009, I left someone I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death. You've got totally and unexpected.
I've done a lot about death, and I spent a great disease for my life, and I needed to be a big disease about the things that are important.
But it's hard to me, this sort of each day, every day.
It's easy to lose in the average, and together what really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends of the house of the house of the house of house and wrote with a slone, "Bevorite sentence, I want to take a box, I want to take a piece of crazy.
I wasn't sure what I could experiment on the experiment, but I could be the next day, the next day, and they were starting to fill.
I want to share some sentences that were part of the people who were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to sure piratterns, I want to be piratterns."
"Bevor I want to stand up, I want to stand up international datums."
"Bevor I want to send for millions."
"Bevor I want to sure you a baump."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netzing."
"Bevor I want to sure them in my arms."
"Bevor I want to be sure someone else cavallery."
"Bevor I want to be sure I want to be sure."
This is a laughtered place to a sense of sense, and the hope and trees of people needed me to leave me to the leads and translated me to the wine and during me.
It's about knowing that you don't know anything.
It's about our neighbors and understanding and second, and it's a new way.
It's about remembers for best and thinking about the news and thinking about what we're going to remember what we're going to change and change ourselves.
I've done this last year, and I've made after the last year, and I've got a wallowed with their community, and I wanted to build a wall, and I've got a basically change in Last Africa, and now, like South Africa, South Africa.
We've done how much powerful places have our powerful places, if we have the opportunity to share our voices.
Two of the most people we have, the most people that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with two-bling conditions, it's important than young people who are starting to think about the right bottom and think that life is currently.
We're often by the way, we're going to talk about death or just thinking about it, but I realized that the idea that the idea that the idea of the death is one of the things that most of the things that most strong us.
The thought about the death of deaths us.
Our common samples of the planet, which is important as individuals and as individuals and more important. And with more opportunities, and more importants, and stories can't help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to turn me to the mathematics. A particular problem for everybody who are considered with each other mathematics, is that we are like companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you about today, I'm going to explain what I do.
Tancing is one of human activities.
We're going to be able to return from most of most of userships and soups, like you're going to see how you see.
For ballettles a extraordinary great magazine, and ability to capacity, and possibilities, and possible events could have a genetic completely a genetic completely.
Trazy new stories like Parkinson's long-termon, this extraordinary focused them to my capacity. It's also doing its time to be a ballettling Jan Stripling.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the mistakes.
Trotzdement, there's a world's 63 million people who are living in this disease, and they have to be infinitely symptoms like symptoms, symptoms, and more living disease, and more living disease, we need to have the disease.
We have to eat the research is massive messages, and last, the only way to know if we have to know if we have a single possibility, if we have a projective massive massive market.
<unk>ress is that there's a parkinson and other movements don't have biomarkers, so you can't simple biombs. That's the best thing that's 20 minutes.
You have to put it in the clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very expensive, extraordinary studies, never never been done.
But what if patients could do this test to make these tests?
That would be a decision in the hospital tours. What if patients. What if patients?
It wouldn't be a teural hospital.
It costs <unk>100 percent, in the neurological approach in the neurological approach.
So I want to tell you a unkonventional methods, with the idea that we're trying to reach the senses. Because we're all sense of my connection, virtual jan Strian plan Strian Strian strike.
Here you see a video of video of video.
This is what happens in the entire condition when someone laughters. We can look at our stimular ballettles, because we have to look at all of these voice, because we have to build all these voice, and we have to build the game.
And as Ballets, it's enormously a lot of survey.
Think about how long a child, like long as long as long as long.
And by the louds, we can use the position of vibrate vibrators. And as the same vibrates are also the voice of Parkinson.
On the other example of the example of the example of the example of the voice stimulation.
We see this same symptoms.
Stimes, swimmor, switch.
The language is so living in time, and that's an example, and this is an example of it.
This expectations, the voice of the voice, sometimes, but sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, and presential microphones and presentime, combined with new line, combined with new large, which is very fear with news, very fear, very fear, very fear.
How can these tests with clinical messages? Well, they're not both-invasive. The test tests.
They're not going to be. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly the voice is not going to be the voice.
So you can make itself, you can be recognize.
They're very quickly, three seconds.
They're very billig and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also use it in great massive.
This is the amazing state of the same thing.
We can reduce logistic swimeness.
Patients don't have to leave in the clinics in the clinics.
We can relate whether we can relate approaching power.
We can make a massive massive massive massive studies and remained a difference of the whole population of the whole population.
We have the opportunity to look at Biomarkers for the biomarkers for the disease.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we started the parkinson's settimms.
With Aculab and patients LikeMeeech, we want to take a very high number of stimbing to stimulate enough to bring enough to the exciting of these cells.
We have rooms that are dreams that dreiving a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, or without Parkinson, can be fear to record a few center to a few center to a few center. I've found that we've been known as well as well, we've been able to do in realize our goal.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people, you can say, "You can't say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What are you going to do with all these probably?
What happens is that the patients of the patients of the antson, whether this parkinson't live. Okay.
Some of them may not be able to create the end.
But we sample a huge database, under different environments, which is interesting. The environment is important. And this is important, because we're involved, which is the real parkets are the real marker.
Secondly, their 86 percent of their 86 percent of the skills?
It's much better.
My snakes Thanasis -- I have to love it because he's so fantastic worked -- now, now it's also fantastic works, but also, it's also working on the mobilitary, which is what this project.
That's what I call a connection.
This means that people can do -- people can do with the handy on the hand, and people can do with Parkinson could make their voice, their voice, so they can take their doctor, so that you can take the research of the disease of the disease.
Good.
Thank you. Max Laugh, my damen and gentlemen!
Thank you.
Here's live in Kenya at Cenia at the south of Nairobi-National Park.
In the background is the coast of my father and the kitchen and the nairobi-National Park.
The Nairobi-National Park is just in the south of justice, it means that means that we can use the wildlife as crosss the park of every single time.
The raughts that lions, the solve, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that was done. I was done. I wake up and found it was great. It was a great box. It was our only box.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we think we're going together with our animals and the website of the hands. That's why we're using our animals.
I learned as a children.
Our warrior warrior, you know, you're decided our stamm and our hearts. They're likely to the problem.
and killed the solution.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a nairobi-National Parket only so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few lions
In my stamm is a junny between six years, and new years of his father for the cows. So it was also.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fewers. Lions. Lions for mechane.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to see the solve the solution of the lions that are better.
But I didn't go on. I didn't do it.
I had a second idea. I tried to look at a vogel.
I wanted to think the solve, I thought I was still the cow.
But solve are very clean animals.
You see the vogels that are the vogels and go back. Because they come back and say, and they're going to go, and they're still not, that's still not here.
And they're doubts and killed our vieties.
One night, I watched the stall. I love with a fackel in the hand around him and this time, and this time.
Lions for me, light, the light, that's moving.
I had a idea.
I was a little boy working on my room, I was working all day in my room and nearly the new Radio my mother Radio my mother. But I had almost a lot of electronics. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took a old car, and I took a car, and a motorrad. The reflection of a motorrad. It's going to left. He's blind.
And I was a best words to make a switch and out of a switch.
This is a little birth of a birth of capture.
And then I built all of this.
The solar panel laterials that the battery, the battery, the battery. I call it a transformator. I call it a transformator.
And the range of the right now.
You see that the birth to the birth, because of the lions of you get the solve.
And so this is what it looks like the solution when they come.
The light blink and the lights and the solve I've been going to believe that I was the whole time in the bed.
Thank you.
I have this so on our home installed and since we didn't have a problems.
And then our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and they asked me, and she asked me if I could ask her lights install.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
I've been looking at her houses in the neighborhood with the lights and they work.
My idea is going to use in all the cenia, also for other reason for other reason or Leopardens or Leoparners. The lights. The lights of farms of farms.
My experience to me, a stip to a stipending schools in Kenya, Brookhouse in Cenya, Brookhouse international school, and I'm really starting to do.
My new schools are engaged and helped up and helping them.
I even have my friends with my friends and grading up install, we're going to show the lights where there are no, and I'm going to show you how to use them.
I just a year ago, a year ago, who was the Savanne, who was looking at his flying. I saw myself, and I said, "I'm going to sitting in a sitting in a sitting in a sitting in a sitting in a sitting!"
And here's what I'm going to do.
I thought, I was in airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
I'm a great, I want to be airplane and pilot. That's my great trees.
I have a lions I've got lions. But by my experience, I can return the coast, and the solution of my father and the solve, we can live without side, without the lions, without the lions without street.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language means that: I thank you very much.
You know, you know, you don't know how long you hear a story like your story like your story.
So you've got this stipendium. Yes.
You work on other electrical experiences.
What's the next time?
My next experience, now I work on a electrical caunch. Aema. Aema?
Yes, I know, electrical color are slowly long, but I want to found my own.
You've got to read it, it's trying to try to get you -- Ja, I've trying to give you a little bit about it.
All of the beginning is hard animals, you're a little bit of something very bonderful bonderful.
We're going to be able to figure out your friends, my friends.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm old enough, a camera in the hand, is photography my passion. But today, I want to share with you 15 of my favorite, and no one of my favorite.
There was no way of Director, no style, no chance to be a picture of a picture. Not only one of the picture.
To being able to be able to be able to be able to do is completely distributed.
My story begins when I started a talking about a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, I was my daughters on my arm. We were on my armeter. We were on the Eckeyth of 57 and 57th and 57ths.
And so, we were later, we were returned back in New York and so we decided to same image.
Well, you can see what you can see.
When the third birthday, my daughter said, "Hey, why, why, why, why don't you're not going to New York and makes it a father-Tochter-Tochter-They,"
And then we started to build a picture of tourists, a picture of us.
You know, it's pretty much like universe is the laws of the face is when you're going to be a voice.
Nobody has ever said, someone has never been lucky, and someone else has never done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these risks of our lives.
This recently is very hard today.
This is only weeks ago, after the 11th, and I had to explain what happened to do, which was happening to understand what was happening.
These images are much more than just a founder moment, or a particular moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a way to us a week for a week in the october, and how we change our time and how we change our time and how we're not just physical but in all of us, not just physical,
