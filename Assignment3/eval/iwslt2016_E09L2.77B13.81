When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clenging crowd.
My father heard on his little bit, women Radio the news forests of the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual, because of the news that were depressed to the news.
He called, "The Taliban are familiar!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father, I didn't really happy.
"You can go to a right school," he said," he said.
The morning I'm never forget.
All right school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and they spent a girls, and they spent a girl.
So I was a slide of my five years, I started five years long as a junk, my older sister, who didn't come from a sister, to a head.
Only so we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way, even though, even though, we couldn't get where we went to where we went.
We've been hidden our books in the income, so that it looks like this.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small wohnzimmer.
In the winter was incredible, but in the summer was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the moment, the bottom of the bottom of a weeks, because the Taliban considered.
We were never safe, how much they knew about us.
Do they required us?
Would they know where we know where we're going to learn?
We had anxiety, but we wanted to school.
I had lucky in a family in a family, in education as important and decided to be daughter.
My grandfather was a far.
As a outside of a provinced provinced Afghanistan. He's came to school -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother's dad of his father.
My filmed mother, but it became teacher.
That's what they're.
Two years ago, she went to the rhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here's the first in his family, who was ever a school picture of a school picture.
For him, it was a realized that his children would be a children, also his daughter, even his daughter, dead, trotzing every risk.
He looked like a much bigger risk of his children don't go to school.
I know that I'm still under the Talibanches, sometimes, sometimes, from our lives, from our lives, from our lives,
I had good loss to give you a lot of father said, "The can lose my father, you can lose your life.
His money can be carbon. You can be done in war. You can be done in war.
But a thing is going to be done, and that's what's here, and even if we're going to do with our blood for your blood for your schools, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country on a country that was destroyed by war.
Less than 6 percent of my age of my age of my age, a higher a higher than the secondarables. And when my family, and when my family, I would have a women.
Instead, I'm standing here, as a proudle of the Middlebury College.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was my grandfather, because he'd been understood because he'd been to school, his daughter to school.
He doesn't just talk to my high school, but also, I'm also the first woman, and I'm the first woman who was the first woman, and I'm a car.
My family believed me.
I have great trees, but my family has greater trees for me.
So I'm global bothers for 1010, a global both of women's world for the education of women.
So I've got too launch, SOLA, and maybe some internative internative for girls in Afghanistan, a country, a country, a country, in the schoolbes.
It's wonderful to see how the students of my school with great leadership with great leaderships.
And to see how their parents and varians for them, as I mean, as I mean, as I mean, and I decided everything.
So as Ahmed. That's not his face and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Again, a months ago, and he's on the home of SOLA in her village, and they're the death, and they're just about a bombs.
When he was home, he came up with the phone and a voice, and a voice, he would be able to school, he would try to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "Toy me now, if you want to be when you want to sit down my daughter, but I'm not going to sit down to play the future and overholds."
What Afghanistan, so I realized something that's what I realized something that's going to be able told us: Hinter most of us who have a father that the value of us who is a father that it's a father, and the explane.
That's not succeed that our mothers don't play in our success.
And they're harmers are harming the ones that are possible for a lot of possible for a lot of their daughters. But in a society like the infghanistan is the infghanistan is the infinite amazing.
On the Taliban went to school, just a few hundred girls -- because it was some of the girls.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are recognize how we're doing this.
I'm notice that the changes are not by daughters and they're changing the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the schooler in my school, and their parents that they're going to take a lot of them to make a lot of parents that they're going to take a lot of parent and a long-termanistan.
Afghanistan is for me to a country of hope and the uncomfortable opportunities, and it remember every day.
And as I've got big trees.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, also, my life -- my life -- my life -- my life was in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1971 to 1977 -- I'm slowly -- I'm in Sambia, Kenya, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria, Algeria, Algeria, and Somalia, and Somalia,
I worked for a Italian NRO, and every single project that we've been on the legs that we've been on the legs.
I was doubt.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did everything we're doing.
Our first project, what my first book "Ripples of the book "Ripples inspiring," was one that we wanted to show you how to show the people who want to show you how nutrition.
We came with Italian Saatgut in South America, in this to Sambia; in this to Sambesi Flussi flying. We lived the animic population and tomates and tomates and Zucini.
Of course, the answers had no interest in this, so we didn't pay for the work, so we could do for the work, and sometimes they're also paying them.
We were amazing that there was no country in a so early talue.
But instead of asking why they didn't look at why they said, "God's simply saying, "God."
"Govery-conful to save people to save the people to save the people."
Of course, all wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, we had this practice, they were so big, in Sambia so big,
We couldn't believe it and said, "Shouse, like simple country is like simple landwirt."
When the tomata, and red, came over night about 200 nights from the flower of the flow and wonderful.
We said to the Sambiern: "Oh God, the Nilpferde!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a country here."
"Why didn't say, "You've never asked us."
I thought, we were so greater, well, but then I saw what the Africa, but then I saw what the Americans made what the Englands, which was the Frenched, which was a lot of what they did, I was quite statement in our project.
We felt the nest, the nilproducing.
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainty that we don't look at the uncertainly.
They should be the book "Thead Aid" by Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambic economic economy.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have changed the African continent 1.5 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been telling you what this money.
Let's just going to take her book.
Les you know about a African, which we have angered.
We're a western people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two ways, like we're patrize them or we're patriarchalical.
Both words are coming from Latin Apatin," which means "Vather" means "Vather" means.
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalic: I'm treating everyone else of a different culture, they were my children. "I love you."
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone else of a different culture, they were my dying.
That's white people in Africa, people in Africa, Chef, Chef, called Chef,
I was a growing up when I was the book "Small is the book," from school, he said, "The Government, everything in economy when people don't want to go into the rhead.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is respect.
Today, the morning of the heart of the conference, a stab on the ground, and asked a stab on the ground, "Can you're not neocolonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react people, just to people, and he's a system called company, which is never going to be initiated with someone who's never going to be motivated, but you're going to be available power of the people who are evention that the people who are evention of the people
What you do -- you're doing -- you're going to be the mouth.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're going together with the individuals.
We don't work from books.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Caf."
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally foundations and find out what the person wants to find what the person wants to find.
The most important is the passion.
You can someone else is a idea.
If these person doesn't like this?
The passion for the own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own growth is the most important thing.
We help them to find the knowledge that can never be able to find anyone.
The person with the idea hasn't knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this unfall: Why, why, instead of saying, what they should do, why don't hear about why do we hear them? But not in community.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
Compan have never been part of the public and they're never going to say what they want to do with their money to see what they're seeing for opportunities.
Planation has this blind flow.
The closest people who don't know the community, because they never seem to open up.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, it has to be a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new records have to be created.
This is the house of the companies of the company of the bedroom, who's the house that you're in your cocketry, and in the caf<unk> situation, your passion to find your passion to transform your passion in a way to transform your passion.
I have this in food, West-Australia, trying to try to do this.
I promovated to the time and tried to get out of time and trying to decide where we should do what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had just walked into the first year, and I had my first customers. I half of my first customers, and he was a garage, and I half, he was a restaurant. I him a restaurant.
I half these fishers, and I'm working together and this wonderfish thunfished in Albany for 60 cents, but to sell us, but after Japanese for 15 dollars, but for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do this?
How do you.
I hold the mouth and high-driven."
So -- -- so -- so the government: "Make it again."
We've made it in 300 community in 300 community.
We've got 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to happen.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, story, story, story, starting with 96 years ago.
Peter pressure was philosophyprofessor, before he was businessed with companies. Peter pressure, Peter pressure, Peter pressure, in fact, increasingly uncomfortable and economy."
Planation is the death is the death of the entrepreneurs.
So you build Christian to know what the clock of human christian Christian Christian and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get to a bring.
You have to give them discretion and privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them to help them, and they're going to get them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
What presentation have you've been able to do most applauday?
<unk>romic, empty people. The people have applications.
I want to say that company is that entrepreneurs.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- norrowing fossil fuels, fuels, fuels, and suddenly there are sustainable.
The construction is not a sustainable.
The Freon-Artt is not a sustainable.
We need to look at how we look at them, we have to look at seven billion people on a sustainable ways, transportation, transportation, transportation.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will this technology for the green revolution? Universities? Oursities? Cliving?
The government? Are you.
It's going to be investigate. And they're going to do it.
I'm a future story in a future of a future of many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were actually the einglements that were the future of New York in 1860 to best.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happens in 100 years, with the city of New York, the shadow of New York, the city: The city wasn't existing in 100 years.
Why? You saw the curve, and they said, when the population in this tempoint in this tempoints, they needed six millions of population to people who are impossible with millions of six millions of six millions of six millions.
Because they went to the master.
1860, they see the bad technology that life looks like New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001 cars in the United States -- 1001.
The idea that I had a different technology to find a different technology, and there was little fabrics in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with companies.
And when he needs to be able to be able to be able to be both.
On the first one, they don't talk to you.
And when next thing you need to use them, engaged and empowerful service.
Then you have to remove them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the smallest company to the biggest company, three things out of the course: that's to sell you that need to be able to buy the consumer that needs to be able to be able to be able to be able to be available.
Rather?
We never met a single person who can make a single person who can sell you something that can care about the money.
That's not something exists.
This person was born.
We've been looking at the research and our most iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Fording, Fording, Ford the new companies, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yoogle, Yahoogle, Google, Yahoogle, Google, G
There's only one thing that allowed all of the world's community of the world, just one: No one: No one person, just one person.
Now, we're going to learn 16-year-old United States, and we started the first two sides of Richard Branson Autobiography, and the first two side of Richard Branson Autobiography. The first one of the first one of the first side of the first two-yards.
No one of the time and 32 times "wir."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody basically, a company. No one company.
So can we create a community, in the past, which is a little bit of members, in Caf<unk>s and Bars and Bars, and your engaged caf."
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you sell on the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't you." "Mo young people for you?"
We activate generate communities.
We have groups of freedom that can be undergrounded by the companies that are undergrounded by the middle of the middle and people have found that the wonderful population of the intelligence of the economy of the economy and economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be able to be alice in the wonderful.
The Penn State University bather, a docentin for communication -- attack in communication -- in communication.
I had afraid.
Right? Again. Ango. Agster with their great brain and their great brain and their great big books and their big books.
But as the conversation, it was developed, it was like alice as an alice as they were going to look at the canninlock and a door to a whole new world.
And I felt that I felt when I was talking about the students with the students. I was amazing about the thought they had discovered that they had this wonderful, and I wanted to discovered that other wonder.
I think that to open this door to open this door, it means it's great communication.
We need to be unbelieved in our scientists and engineering and engineers and engineering the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that our biggest problems, like, for example, energy, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't understand it, and I don't think it's nothing in our responsibility than our consciousnession.
But these great conversation doesn't come to understand our scientists and engineers and engineers,
So scientists and engineers and engineers, clearly, clearly.
I want to show you a few answer, how you can see it, how you can see that the science and the technology and the technology, and the technology, sexy and span you're planet.
The first question that you have to answer is: Na and?
Says us, why we're just a scientific areas that's so relevant for us.
Says not only that their dreams are undergrounds, but also tells us that their dracts that their dracture in our bone, because they can understand the bone, because it's important to understand own, because it's important to understand.
And if you do that, what you do, what you do, then you're using forward.
Faching is a hinder of leasting, for understanding.
Sure could use their doctors, and pretty course, but why don't you say, "Raum and time you don't just understand what much understanding?
Our thoughts to make simple, is not the same as their nive buildings like their nive.
As an amazing thing said, "Macheaches the things that simple as possible -- but not easy."
You can tell us something about you, something about you know, you know, without knowing that you can tell you about it.
A few things are involved to bring stories: For examples, stories and analogies. As you can tell us in your bannel.
And if you're working on your work, then the story, then the story.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's called "Stunct"?
What happens when someone is that if someone else is going to be a different, and with these points, and with these points.
A following how this is not just a long time, but also too very long, but also too much on the language of our brains and drops them, and we're fast.
This example of geneview of genevieve Brown is much we can see that the special structure of the trabeller. It's so stable, that's so stable to the inspiration for the inspiration for the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect.
The trick here is a single, a single simple sentence, and that's audience, when it's audience, orients, orientation can use the pictures and graphics, and the other senses that are also approaching our other.
These are just a few answer that can help us to open this door, and the wonderful and the wonderful and the technology in it.
And the engineers I've been undergrounded by me, with the <unk>Nerd in me," with the EnNerd in me."
And the question of euroscience, and your stories are able to share this through the relevant, so that's what's important, and that's important, and multiplicated the global economy, and it's unbelievable working on it. And it's unbelievable working incomes that
So scientists and engineers, if you've got this equation, clarifying me inside me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy can you a cell phone in Syria, you can films.
With a handy can tweet a news and a protestail and a protestail.
And with a handy can take a song, you can take a song, it's going to be a song.
All of that is possible.
I'm a year 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people in changes for changes on the streets and the constrated.
We are in the herfore 1989 and imagine that all these people who had changed ones and changes that had changed.
Who is a handy there?
Hold it up.
Hold your hand phone, high, you hold them!
Hold it up. Aroid, a blackberry, a blackberry, wow.
These are many. Fast everyone has a cell phone.
But today, and my handy talk about me and my hands, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
This is 35.830 cases of information.
Rohdata.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U. Commission is a relined.
This is called the right is called Rightlinie, the relination.
This relines is that every telephone is that every telephone in Europe, every in Europe, every Internet, every Internet Europe, a bandbreaker information.
Who is it going to be a magic? Who is a email?
Who wonderful?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years of your telephone, or your telephone or your Internetanbiety or your Internetanbie.
And everywhere in Europe, people have said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to be."
They said, we wanted to do this idea.
We want to be self-based in digital time, and we don't want to be the phone and Internet, and we don't want to talk about us.
There were an advice, Journalists, Preester, who all said, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of Berlin streets and said, "Freedom."
And some people said that could be the stasi 2.0.
The stasi was the secretsi in Ostdepolice.
And I asked me, whether this really works.
Can you really think about all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone, I asked my phone, the deuter science that was the biggest parts that were the largest part of the Germany, and I asked her, and I asked her to me, all of me.
And I asked them, and she asked her, and she didn't get a right answer. Nur learning.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is protocollated.
So I decided to do a general important, they wanted to have a bit of information because I wanted to have this information.
But the deal of telecom said, no, no, we're going to give you this information.
At the end of it came to a compare with them.
I'm going back to the fix where they all send me to me, they all send me.
Because in the fundamental population of the minute process of the emotion of E.U..
So I'm going to take this half-shaps with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 cases on information.
First, I saw it and said to me, it's half a huge diates. My date.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this dateift.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I start with this?
Because you see where I'm where I'm where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public information.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show you what is the presence of what is means.
So with time open data City, I've data City, so I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reinciooms and raus, you can predict and return back.
You can make every step, because I do after that I'm going to do.
And you can see how I can see from Frankfurt with the stuff, and how many answer to close, and how many answer.
All of that is possible to this information.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First of all, it's just like my wife, and she calls me, and we talked me, and we talk together.
And then I called a few friends and they call a couple of friends.
And after a while you and you call it and you call this huge communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they can go to a certain time they go to bed a bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect defect event, as you can see a society of how to reday, because you know who is a magail, who's possible when you're possible when you have access to this information.
And these information are going to be security for months, in Europe to 2 years.
As I said, we said, we asked that all these people in the streets in the streets in the high school in her tasks in their tasks.
And the stasi, who had been wonstration of the demonstration of the demonstration, and when the state of the stasi, then that maybe the leaders are never happened.
The case of the blinderliner magazine magic.
And also, not the case of the case of the ice.
Because today is stategentures and companies are so many information, like they can talk about us, like they can go online and often, online and often.
They want to have the opportunity to have our lives, and they want to be able to remember the long long long long long long long long long long long long.
But even investigation and a life in digital time in the digital time.
But you have to fight for the self-based for the self-based.
They have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you go home, you say, Privacy is a value of 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you go home, just because companies have to have your attention and state the possibility, the opportunity to specific information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think you're asking your phone, you've been talking about you've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you use your handy, you remember the self-based on your self-based on the digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoes, snellrestaurants, breaks, breakfast.
So the city planer does, and so they're survived the Namen South Central to change something else, so it's changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that's something that changes the city of what's going on.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituoes, snow fastrestaurants, breaks.
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food South Central Los Angeles, the home of Drival Los Angeles, the Drivive-thrus and the Drive-by-by-by-by-byear-old.
The comic is that the Drivive-thrus more people killed than the Drive bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The father's father in my fourth is quarter than about four times a higher than about 15 kilometers, which is about 15 kilometers.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how you feel like you would feel like you're not a stuff, if you could have a stuff, if you'd have to see out of the house that negative effects that are the best expectations that have the best exercise.
I'm going to buy the role of the role and selling how buying areas.
I see the dialysecreasing emporary small.
And I realized that this is that the physicians.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no loss, I had no loss to 45 minutes to get a minutes to get a minutes that don't have a present.
So I plant a food vessel forests, I was a food.
It's a piece of land that we call Parkanlage.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is the thing that it's the city.
But you have to figure it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility and I have to hold it."
And I decided to keep it into standing.
So I came up and my group, the L.A. Green Basounds, and we started together, and we started to plants, and open, soon, soon, soon, soon, the whole program, so that's the whole program.
We're a kind of a kind of a kind of prediction, together from all social signs and all the city, and from all the city, it's free-scale, and everything we do, is costless.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else.
The city came up to me and he told me and he told me a practical record, and said that I have to have to be a huge amount of a richeral record.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A richeral records of food, food is a food of food on a piece of land, that's true totally?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herman."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The LA. Times, Wind, Wind Lopez Lopez, and I spoke a story about it and talked to the city and talking to a member of Green Brazil. They were a petition of change.
We thought you're going to hold in the hands.
My city rather rather than and said that she said they're understood that they're doing what we do.
So why should they do that?
LA.A. has in the United States most of the city of the city of the city.
They're bringing 67 miles.
That's 20 central Parks.
This is enough flowerful for 725 million tomates.
Why wouldn't you shouldn't find that?
And by the beginning of a plant of a plant, you know,000 sames.
With green bohs in the value of a dollars in the value of 75 dollars in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my home, I say, I'm going to say that they should be building their own food.
His own food is how it's own money is how its own money.
Look, I have a consumption in South Central.
I'm going to try to do my sons there. I have my sons.
And I'm sure that part of this pretty represent the reality of other people who were fabricated by other people, and I fabricians my own reality.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Graffiti-conster, the walls, the walls, I beautiful, I'm going to beautiful, I'm going to beautiful.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of piece, and the plants are my relationships for these stuff.
They would be surprised what the Earth can use it as a country when you use it as a country.
You can't imagine how it's amazing a sunlume is, and how they are leadership.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden to a instrument for the responsibility and the relationship of my fourth.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the ground.
We are the ground.
They would be wonderful, how kids are going to be confluenced.
Garden is the therapistic and coastic and coolest, especially, especially within the city.
And then you get a memory.
I remember this time when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30 tots, and I got out in my garden, and I got out of my garden, and I came out.
I've been feeling me, because they were feeling, and I said, "Wis you don't have to do it.
The garden is not a reason on the street."
I went told me when I saw people who saw me so narrative me, and that's what I've just asked me, "Fin, people asked me, you're not afraid to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be."
And I said, "There's no, no, I don't know what they're not angry.
And it's about the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it back to the same time to take their health."
And I was a different time, I was a garden in this observed in Downtown L.A.
These are the guy who have helped me to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how it has been fully and how they've been fighting with her mother and their grandmother and it was greater, and it was great for a moment.
Green reason is so basically about 20 garden.
To our environments came together, so 50 people and they were all freedom and they're all freedom.
If kids carbon, it's eating kids.
If they cut them, they eat, they eat.
But if they don't get anything about it when they're not going to get the food and body eating and body eating them, they're eating them, they're always eating them.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work, but they're standing in this thing -- I see, I see the same kids who are exactly on the path, and the only thing they're going to go.
The gardens, I see as a opportunity where we can train these children can train themselves to care their communities to feel after life.
And if we do that, who know who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carver Bring.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Earth, we're going to change that.
So this is one of my plane. That's what I want.
I want to share a whole wanted to plants where people can share the same flocks in the same flock.
I want to take schoolscontainer and they're using it in healthy.
So, don't understand me.
I don't talk about costless snow, because the cost is not sustainable.
The comic sustainability is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about people, people working to help kids of the streets of the streets, and they're going to leave the streets and the eating, if you look at your own food, and if you build your own food.
So what I want to do here is to do here.
I want to be able to all the ecological rebellire, Gangster, Gangster.
We need to make the image of Gangsters.
If you don't have a gangster.
Ganger is you going to buy with 'n't clear?
And let's read the weapons.
If you want to meet with me, you don't want to do when you want to do in the cave meetings and make a meeting and a meeting, where you want to talk about where you talk about it.
If you want to make meet meet you, you're going to sell you, in my garden, so we can use any snow.
Force. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite swimming in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so nice.
And "snollygoster" means "No infinite politicians."
Although in 19th century in 19th century, a better definition, "It's a better definition is someone who is a youngoster, which is a bigger of parents or line, program or lands of parents, and his regularly by the parad of parad of parad of regin
I have no idea what "spracheral" is.
Something with World, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians, they need to control the language.
For example, for example, the British Parlament, the British Parlament, time, time, time,
And that was actually back to the mutual named a man with the man with the extraordinary names Brass Crosby, who was on the Parlament.
She was him in the Tower of London and lon and launched it, but he was mutig enough to enough to produce enough, and he was so much more support, and he was so much difficult to be in London, he won't know that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first night, we find the first night for the first night, like Brass."
Brasses are incredible for bad.
But that's not true. It's going back to a return to a press.
But to show you how words and politics are done to the United States, I want to take you to the United States, as they're just reached the unpreconnected.
You saw the question of how to do George Washington, the state of Washington, name.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a republican nation?
And that was in Congressive in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible forces.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernor Washington, and other, others, and others, and others, and others, and others of the United States of America, Washington.
Not so that's not a present.
Some people wanted to call it a nice crazy.
They thought that's been done.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the kingdom.
It would have been working.
But everyone was incredibly uncomfortable because this debate 3 weeks.
I have the days of a senators that are still going to be still the same thing: "Immerging the same is the same is the same issue.
The reason for the reason for the longer was that the longer was that the representation.
The representants didn't want to do that what's going to do. They wanted to do it.
Canig nice, and they're going to take it on ideas.
They wanted to him the most powerful, young, young, the most painful title.
This title was "President."
President. They didn't existed the title. He existed. But he was a suffering that someone is a valuation.
That's how the prepared a jury.
He didn't have any larger than the record of "Auff.
Sometimes, there were president little colonial community and governments and governments, but it was really an indeed title.
That's why the senating him.
They said, "That's lowerful, you can't call it President.
This closed to be able to describe and out of the citizens and out of citizens.
Who gets him, if he's going to take a thumbs like President of the United States of America?"
And also after 3 weeks, the senates didn't look forward.
Instead of the minds that we don't want to use the title of the middle of the minds, but they wanted to use the color of the minds that they were not available respects of their own methods and methods.
You can learn three interesting things.
First, I think that's what I've been able to find out if the senates, whether the senates of the title president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just been just given. He was just about it.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government is that something temporary -- then you know, you were 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important, that's the most important point is that the title of the United States of America," is not so clearly not so hard today, right?
This has something more than 5,000 nuclear popular creating the biggest volces that he's biggest volces and a flottom of the world and a floth of drone.
In fact, and story, the title of the title.
And so the senat at the end of the end.
They have a respectable title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of embrace -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the climbs with the five limits with the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the senat and the representat and the representation because nobody is never felt that you're going to feel that you're going to be the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take me and with the way I decided to do with.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality to control the reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, but actually changed the reality of reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelling campaign for a campaign for a 19-year-old, four-year-old surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'd like to tell my black converse Halboose a couple of country, and celebrate a rocket in region of government, which I couldn't even see if I couldn't even see anything I couldn't even see anymore.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was written with war, all the war, all the new pyjama Partys and football playing, and football playing with rassistic southern South Astairs and religion conditions.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm asking here, I've been born, South Afghane, Southeists God's Godes. Atheist and a radical politized artists who worked in Afghanistan, who worked in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do is a lot of great things that you couldn't make a personality, but I don't want to make art. I want to make art. I want to make the personality and cars that are involved and cars and reportionality and reality.
I want to spend a day in life of a vihad -- Gangster, who bring his vihads like <unk>Popstar bubbled to the same as <unk>Popstarling" and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's going to do is the vihad gangster than the parlament to candidate a choice and make a choice, and I'm going to do with the slogan: "Well, I'm going to talk."
And try to use these campaign to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosiosiosi.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and I'm going to go back to a project that you can take a project, which is a wrong with a policy of control of the streets of cabular cabular, but including the streets and cars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan of my mind, I wonflict, the "modical conflict.
The war and the war and the free-scale came with him, and we came up with a new environment for style and models that you can only make a model that you can only make a model of skills and self-orthe-collected in the cells.
And I would like to see how a simple ships from Kabul between Kabul between Kabul between Kipling Appelling a dialogue today about it today today, and they're going to create their wornings.
But for all of these things you can get in prison, they can be missed, they can be missed, missing missing.
But I do it because I have to do because the geography of self-low.
That's my favorite. What's your face?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I work as a model.
Since 10 years, right?
I feel that feeling that now is a unfailable space, because I wouldn't have a tendency, because I didn't have to stop this clothes.
And fortunately, I have something to do something for this.
This is the first time you're the first time on the TED book on TED book, so you can see, so you can see that.
If you were really explored, when I was really explored when I wasn't need to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to go to Twitter.
I also found that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds, because I can change what you think about me.
There's no chance.
This is very uncomfortable, it's good, it's good that I didn't want to wear.
The worst part is hardest part of my head is to cover my head, because then you'll allow me to keep me, so long as long as long as head.
In order.
Why did I do that?
That was possible.
Well, it wasn't so picture as this image.
One is a powerful, but a powerful, it's also operating.
I just have to changed your opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photograph, I told my back and my back in my back in the hair, and with my hair in the hair.
And then from operations or the wrong breaks or the wrong breaks that I've been two days for the work, there's only very few opportunities, and our questions, and our question, even though it's own life -- even though it's affective.
Through to be hottless today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I asked on this stage because I'm a hill, because I'm a woman, and in my branch, and in my branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How are you going to be a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I realized," but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, a model, a violence and a important experience and maybe you're asking this experience.
Well, in the last few centuries, we've been able to beauty and young and young and young and young, we're a biological programmed, but also hospital, but also hospital.
This experience was created for me. And it's a same for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Joan Smalls. Liuy Wenyra.
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to learn your model.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very large in 2007, the NYU.
The next question that means, the next question is, "Can I'm going to be a model when I'm going to grow?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to girls that I want to give you a little girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be everything.
You can be president of the U.S. or the United States or the next Internet or a ninja-Herzi-HerzirgDichter, which is greater, because then you're going to be the first."
If they still saying, "No, no, no, no, no, Cameron, I want to say, "Who's going to say, "Who's my cover."
Because I don't have a responsibility for the Chefredible, the Chefredible or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next side of H<unk>amp;Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model, you're going to say that you're going to have a boy once in the lotto the lotto.
You can't be able to confluence and it's not a career.
Now, I want to give you 10 years of you to give you 10 years, because other than harder, because other than herzchires can only be folding now.
If there's a photographer, and the light, and the light, and the center, and the century, and the cameron, we want to walk a photo in the light, and then you go to the legs, and then you go to the poor, and that's going to go to the poverty, and that's the possion.
It's about this.
Hopefully more community than the middle.
That was ... I don't know what's happened.
If you've done the school and a life, and a few jobs, you can't have a lot more, you can't say that you can't say that you want to say that you want to be in life, but in life, "10 years, but you're going to go to the United States," you're going to go to look at the United.
The next question that means that I'm often saying, "Who's talking about this photos?"
And yes, so pretty much of the photos are retuss, but that's just a little part of the story.
That's the most picture I made this is what I did, and that was also the first time I was a biciniode. I hadn't even my periode.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girls.
So I just saw a few months to my grandmother.
This is me on the day of this shooting.
My friends had to start me.
This is me on a pyjama Pyjama Party, a few days ago, a couple of days ago.
This is me with the football-Team and in V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
It's constructs and it's construction of a group of profis, from Haws and Make-up artists and photographer and stylists and stylists and stylists and the predictions.
Okay, when you ask me, people ask me, "Well, you know, what do you want to do?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-cm-cm-Absatzer I could never met, except, but the things I can get bigger, things that I'm going to talk about it, things that I don't want to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, I went to a day, and I had a cambridge, and I had gave me the clothes.
When teenagers, I went to my friends with my friends, and they were a red fluor, and of course, and of course, we had a redress, and of course, and it was just a question, and we could just further.
I have this costless things, I have to look at my exception, and not because of my personality and there are people who are people who are paying their extention and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last decades, and they were filtered, 85 percent of the latinos and latinos and most of young men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men are not asking, for the question, "Who are I going to ask the question?"
And it's like, "How often I'm going to take away? When I'm going to paint?"
And I found my rights for this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers are not going to 78 percent when they're 178 percent when they're 178 percent.
The last question of me, "How is it, how is it to be a model?"
And I think they expect them, they expect this answer: "If you're going to be a little bit of harm and believe you feel very happy and fabulous and fabulously happy and fabulous.
And Backstage, we give a answer that maybe this impression.
We say, "It's really great, so much to report, and it's greative, inspiring people."
All that's true, but it's just the half of the story, because what we never say, "I never maybe what I never say, "I feel that I never filled me."
And I feel like me, because I have to think about my exciting every day.
And if you ask yourself, "Where are I happy if I thiness if I had you'd believe?"
Then you should meet a few models, because they have the thinest box, and the most beliefs and the most global coolest coolest coolest coolest clothes and they're the most extraordinary women on the planet.
When I wasn't this talk, I've been very difficult to me, a very difficult piece of a very difficult piece of a situation, because I felt very uncomfortable, and say, "I'm going to fill my grandmother. And I was in my grandmother." And I was felt.
It was very difficult, a very difficult, a same bad of uncertainty and race of bads, if I'm one of the greatest nutrition of it.
But I'm also happy and feeling, and I'm noticed, and I've been able to do it, and I've been here before 10 or 20 or 30 years before 10 or 30 years ago, and my career, because I'd like told my career, because I wouldn't be a filling.
If you take a little bit of this talk, then hopefully that we allow the power of the image of the image of the imagination and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten my grandmother never forget that is never forgotiately, "Son, list of the exilience," and the gaddafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Worldafi.
But who never never been to something like a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the liby school revolution is made by the library, inspires of the waves of the massive of the massive revolution.
I spent a lot of other libyers, in a lot of other libyers, and outside a day of the Zorn, to start a day of the corn and to start a revolution of the tyrannian Regime Gadaffis.
And there was a big revolution.
Junge, liby women and men are stood in the first rest of the first rest of the regimes, hold slogans of the regime, women's the air, and social generality.
They've been aware muthority by using the brutal diagrams that they've been talking about Gaddafis.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the most farmers, until the west, until the south.
Finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 toats, and almost 50,000 tyranes and the guyranes.
But Gaddafi has a big big big business, a citizens of the Tyrannei, the corruption and the reason for course.
Four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannic Regime swime swime, as the infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the lybical society.
The consciousness and the challenge, I asked how many other women, I as many other women's repeated to the civil society. We're going to take a best and national surgery and national experiences.
So to 200 organizations were during and unmediately after the case of Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in Exil, I got back to Lybia, and I started to Lybia, I started to the topicshopshopshopshopshopshopshops and leadershops and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I women's found the peaceplatform Libyscher women, a movement of women, leaderships, and the goal of life, the goal of the condition, the goal of the strength of the strength of the strength.
And in the payments, I met a very difficult environment, a small environment, which is always polarized by the Egoistic politics of the Egoistic politics of dominance and explained.
I was a slide of the peace of peace and available force, and I'm available for a laws, a laws, a law that every business, egal with which every bright and citizens to care and country for all of the right and country.
At the end of our initiative and successful.
Women women 17,5 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But long, but it's a long time, the eye of choice and the whole revolution to news, we waiting for news.
A lot of morning, we went to the money, we've been able to change and Sufi-Grandchildren.
In another morning, we got news in American bothers and the American bothers and the angry.
At another morning, the morning of officiency of the army.
And really, every day, we're going to look under the milize of milize and their others are others and their opportunities and their power and laws.
Our society, we found that we've been a revolutionary opportunity, polarized by the ideal and principles of the ideal and principles, social common skills, social common.
Intolerance, expluse, explored and Rache, the Iconclusion.
I'm not here today today today with the successful story of our remote and the choice listen and the choice.
For example, I'm here today, as a nation that we've been able to create a nation, and the wrong choice.
We've been able told our priorities.
Because the choice, the choice or security or security or security in Lybia.
Hat the remarkable, and the white lists and the way between female and men, men and national female values and national values?
No, it didn't.
What's it?
Why is our society is going to continue our society and dominated by self-hour politics of the dominance and the exception of men, and the exception?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been female, but the female women's female values of the middle of the middle of the middle.
Our society needs a national demonstrationalog and consensumer than they've brought the choice, which is just the end of the end of the polarization and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative construction of the female, quantitative conversation of the female, quantitative construction of the female.
We need to stop in the name of the name of the name of the roach of the roach of the roach.
We need to start to start in the middle of the compassion and the grandchilding.
We need to develop a female developing the following values, but also wouldn't just going to be used, but also together, instead of collaboratory, conclusion, conclusion, approach.
These are the ideal that are a voice that has a completely crified Lybia to make peace.
Because the peace has an alchemic and in this alchemics, it's about the feminal sweets and masculines.
That's the real remarkable.
And we need to existence existence, before we do it sociopolitical.
After a versus from the Coran "Salam" -- Freece" -- Freeks of the word of the word of God.
The word "raheem," that's all the abraditional traditional traditional traditional women, the same as the word "rahembolism," and symbolized the word "mbolized the whole person who's the whole person whole humanity of humanity and the path.
And just like the motherleible of the Embryo, which is completely completely so nutrition of the compassion of compassion.
That's why used told us, "My Gnade all things."
That's why used told us, "My Gnade," before my grandforce."
And so many of us all the point of the grandmother.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country, and I went to the best of the world, and I went to the lower.
And I was very proud.
In school, we've got the story of Kim Il-Sung, but we learned a lot about the world, except that America, South Korea, South Korea and Japanese are.
And even though I often asked me how the eye is, I thought, I thought, I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until a lot of time.
With they saw years, I saw a public head of a public head, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had never had to live with myself.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter a letter of the Swestter of a collegin.
Darin stood: "If you're going to learn our family, our family not being on this world, because we've been for two weeks.
We're going to collapse our bodies and our body are soon as well as well as well as well."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time to the first time that people in my country.
I went to the bahnhof, and I saw something that I can't see anymore I can't get anymore.
A living woman woman on the ground, and a absolutely child in their arm, and a half of his arm.
But no one of them, because all of them, because all of them were so carefully to care their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big challenge in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreaner's falling, and many more than the open, and many more than they're bas, because they're basically, and basically.
In the way, the case, the more and more half after that's been created me everything, except the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the side of the environment.
I always asked me why they had there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors.
This is the flow of Amroccraces, the philos is between North Korea and China and China and China.
As you can see, the flow of flowerful and its opened north Koreanern Coreanern Coreaners.
But many people die.
Sometimes I saw people in the flow.
I can't tell much about how I can left North Korea, but I can say that I can tell you that I've been able to decided to China.
I thought I thought I was a short time of my family.
I would never have thought that it was 14 years to give me together again.
In China, it was very hard to live without girls without family.
I had no idea of how life would be as a north Korean flying, but I would be approached. But I realized that it wouldn't just extremely hard to be very hard. Becore, because it's very dangerous. Becored in China.
So I lived in strangerous, Identity, and Identity, and you would be in a terrible send me in a terrible sending me back to North Korea.
One day, my greater alptraum, when I was asked by Chinese police, and in the Chinese police and in the police.
Someone who was really important to be north Koreanerinese, so they did my chinese countries and asked me to tell me.
I had solarly thought, I thought my heart,
Would you be awas unnatural, I could be approach, I could be used to be able to be used.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I was able to control my life, but I'd being answered and answered the questions.
After they were finished with the example, a relatively, "That was a research.
It's not north Korean."
And she was a wonderful. It was a wonderful.
Some North Korean, in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and repeating and absolutely.
This girls had great happiness.
And even though they were expecting, they were free, they were free international pressured international pressure.
This North Koreanerins didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, in China, in China, in China, and after North Korea, where they're followed, else, either history.
And even though I had lucky fortune, it's a lot of other north Koreaners didn't do that.
It's tragic that North Koreanerans, and hard to care about their identity.
And so she found a new language, and worked in a new language, can be in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the coverage of the coverage of the south Korea, and I started a new life.
Mich in South Korea, was a bigger challenge, a bigger challenge, when I thought it was done.
English was in South Korea, I had to learned that I had to learn to learn.
And I have a big difference between North America and South Korea.
We're all coreans, but inside our inn our innovated, we've been able to do this.
If I flying a identity.
Bince I south or North Koreanerin?
Where are I going to come? Who am I?
Pludes, there was no land more, that my home, that my home.
And even though I didn't work on the southern Corean life didn't have a plan.
I'm already for the attention of the university.
And so I went to my new life, I was a new life, I was a hard to do a bad.
The north Korean bodies, the money I found my family, and when I was sended my family between my family between place to apply place on the country.
They had to fast as possible as possible, so I started to plan.
North Koreanerans have to return a freedom to freedom.
It's almost impossible to require north and South Korea, Ironically took airplane, Ironically to China and made me back to China and made me back to China and Ironic grandchildren.
Because my family doesn't have to talk to them more than 2,000 miles, I had to go to Southeastasia.
The business is a week, and we were more almost a week.
Once again, when the business was a chinese police.
He took the exactly of all and started asking questions.
And I didn't understood, I thought I thought, they would be followed.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided told him that she was decided told him that they were trees, and I would be since.
He looked at measured me, but happy, he was happy.
We did it took it to the laotic border, but I had to ask my money to borders to border the laos.
But even though we had the borders of the border, my family inhaft, because illegal greency.
After I had money and snowered my family, my family was in a month, my family in a month, but my family was repeated in the mainstad of Laos.
This was one of the biggest rid of my life.
I had done everything to family to free my family, and we were so close to family, but my family was just a short of the South Korean Bothorean Bothorean Bothanish Bothorean Bothanish Bothanish Both.
I went to the between the impact of the investigation and the police and police, and I tried to family, but I didn't have enough money, but I didn't have enough money or money or money.
I lost all of my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man who is "What's loss?"
I was fully about this is a friend that a friend of it.
In broken English and with a words and with a words, I went to a bank, and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two northern Corean, and two northern Corean, and two more northern Corean.
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he said, "I don't help you.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The first thing to come from friends, for me to a new hope for me to a new hope that needed to take the North Korean, and he showed me the friends and the internationality of friends and the international community as the hopeful for the northern Commany.
Finally, after our long rise, my family, and I remember family, but the freedom, but the freedom.
Many North Koreaner will be done by their families, and soon as they're going to come in a new country, they're not going to get money or not a money.
The international community can help us to help us to recognition, the English, who are more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the eye, because many of us are still in contact with families, and we're going to change them information and money, and we're hard to change them information and money.
I had a happiness, so much hard to get so much hope inspiration in my life, I hopefully northern Coreanern Coreanern Corean international success.
I'm sure you're more successful North Koreaner on the world, also see on the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a bit of a bit.
Please say, I'm not normal.
I want to imagine my bridge.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't talk to you, but he can't communicated friends, like some of the best redner.
Remi knows what love is love.
It's particularly particularly and expensive.
It's not just a real. He's not a real skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences and imagine, and imagine it's never tell you a light.
If he single-like, when he was trying to remember the words that I don't remember one thing: how little bit about the understanding of how wonderful, and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He's an absolutely uncomfortable memory.
But he has a selective.
He can't remember if he remember my shocola, but he remember the publishment of every lower of every lower on my iPod, conversation that we had four, when he was four, when he was four, the most public public public popular.
Do they don't be incredible?
But many people don't true.
And in fact, because their understanding of the society of normal pases, they're often, they're often, they're often.
But what my heart, and my heart and my soul, and my soul, even though this was the case, even though they were not as a case, even though they were just a similarly approached, that they were extraordinary -- extraordinary.
Well, for those of you who don't asking you who don't useful, it's a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, the social communication, and sometimes the social capacity.
It's approached in every individual, it's a different than Sami, it's a different than Sam.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person autism, and even though it's one of the most fastest growth, there's one of the world, there's no known to be known for the world, there's no known to healthy.
And I can't remember the first time I remember autism, but I can't remember, but I can remember it.
I was just three years old, when my brother when my brother, and I was so excited that I was so excited that I had a new words in my life.
And after a few months ago, he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and in fact, and in fact, it's not very interested in me.
Remians lived in his own world, with his own world, with his own rules, and he found found in the smallest things like, like, Autos in a series in a series in a series of what machine is that what it mechanism machine.
And when he was older, he was different, and the differences were simply different.
But behind the wood and the fun and the frustrates and the nobody was really a very unique, something really unique, a remarkable nature, a junny, a junk of nature, a human beings, a human beings, a human being.
Exceptional.
Well, I can't learn that there was some of the challenge moments in my family, moments, moments I wished that they were like me.
But I go back to the thoughts to the ideas that they've led me to the idea that they've been able to understand the communication and love, and I don't understand that these things I don't want to kill some of the normality.
Normality about beauty that beauty that the difference that we're going to give us, and the fact that we are different, is not that one of us.
It means that there's another way of relationships.
And if I just told a thing to Remi, and then you could say, and then you wouldn't be normal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have -- we have a story! Jeder of us, and everyone in all earlier, and in all earlier, and in all elimate the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance on the size, Fortunity and Wandel, in the moment where we try to be trying to be different.
Bitte -- you don't say that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has a leadership and neuroser to this photo on the photo on the project of a project, and with a million times a million times a million times a million times.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times a million times, and see the world, but the world doesn't have a billion images per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography that femto-Fotography, a new education technology that it can be so fast, that they can make time in movement in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the absolutely look at edge or no personal or no beautiful body in our body, and really, really, really, and really, really, what we can ask with "Kamera."
If I'm going to take a laser potential and him in a millionth of seconds -- that's more female -- that's more female -- I'm a packet of Photon, and this is a millimeter.
So if you take this project, this photones, this photones and take it into these flashion, how are going to behind these photons in the flash?
How does light in time?
So, this whole events.
So, think of it, the whole eventually thought that's actually less than a nanosecond -- so light, so light, the light, and I need to return this video to the factor of this video to the factor 10 billion that you can see the light.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financial.
So, in this movie, so much, so let me show you what's happening to show you what's happening.
The puls, our project, our project, after the flash with a photonpaketer package, and it's hard to move and the finally inside.
A part of the lights outside the table, and you see this expensive and you see this expression of the waves.
Many of the photons of photons, the last last last last, and exploding the range of the range of the range of different directions.
As you can see, there's air bubble that's in the flashion.
Asessence, as the waves are on the table, and because of the reflexions of the reflexions of the reflexions of the focus on the end of the focuss are focused on the end of the focuss.
If you take a piece of projectily, and it's the same streets back to the video to the video to 10 billion people, you know, how long you have to see how long you have to see the film?
All day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long-term -- from a long-term -- from a long-term, normal project.
And how does it look like a little bit of stillle photography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like when you have a sense of a teach.
I'm going to look like this, as a photo males, the nature of a photo males, but of course, it looks like our eyes, but of course, our eye.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that when you'll see that if the lights, you're going to remove this on the tomate. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the tomate is relatively relates and light in their own seconds, and then a million seconds.
So, in the future, if these femto-camera in your camera in your camera, it might be able to make it possible, and if you can go to a supermarket, whether it's a fragile, no create.
So how did my team at MIT this camera?
So when photographer, you know, if you're a photographic recently, you have very little light light light light light, but we're very little billion times as your citizens, so you can't get a billion times as good as well.
So we're going to do this project, we've been looking at this project, millions, millions of times and show them very clever, and then with very clever, and we've combinate this gigabytes of data, we've combinatically recording to you.
And we can take all these rhdates and make very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can make us important, but how would it be a new series for a new soul of superhels: to see ecks?
The idea is that we're going to be a light on the door.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it, a part of it, and then reflects back to the door, and we could reflect these more simplic actors.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built it.
Links on the left, our femto-camera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to leave the door.
After our attention in the Nature Communication," was published by nature, it was made by nature.com.comet them from nature.communication.
We're going to be able to recipe, and they're going to be able to do this poton, and this photones are going to be in all directions, and some of the photons are going to be able to reach the lights that will reach the light and then reach the trees that are going to make a power.
And because we have a camera, the so fast is -- our fasters -- our femto-camera has some single camera.
She's a very good time, and she can look at the world in light.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the first objects, but we don't know what the points to what the point.
Indeed a laser on the laser, we can take a row, we can see a robotic sense of screen -- not really sense of these images, but if we're going to take a lot of these images, and they're trying together and try together, and they're going to trying to doing to do this paintally
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit of doing this, and we can use the lab, we can use the practice, we can build collisions that can use collisions, and we can see what the collisions, or we can see what's going to look at the course of lights.
But because of the blood and violence is very, of course, that's a very hard for scientists, so that's a way to scientists, now, now, is a new female remote, because a new conversation of medicine.
So, how we can do is a scientists, even a scientist, is a scientists, and that's a art of the ultra-construction, and I realized that all of these gigabytes that we can't just clearly knowledge that we don't just know.
But it's happening here, something loss.
If you look at these waves under the flower, you see that the waves are moving from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turned out that we're almost in light in light, because we've seen in lights, and astone effects have seen incredibly seen this image.
The range of the rules, in the world in the world, in the world, he seems in the world, so it's in the camera, so that you can decide the discovery of space and time, we can correct the relationships, we can correct the correction.
So, if we should have to pay for photography or the medical creating a new truthorities, and new data, or new data, we all have data, we all have data and data, we allowed to open up our website.
It's about time. Thank you. Thank you.
There are many ways of our opportunities, how our lives can improve our lives.
We don't meet any neighbors on the street, so many ways, so many ways, but we're going to use the same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and things like aircle, things like aircle, snow-byear-olds and crews.
The projects from my questions, how much maybe my questions, how much might be my neighbors?
How can we stop more things, without us, without us?
How can we leave our memories, how can we share our memory and understand the country?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so that our communities, so that our memory and trees, how do we use our needs?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea is going to be a huge amount of hundreds of hundreds of years, beds, bedroads and trees, and tears, and I'm using a city, and I'm always talking about music.
I think every time, every time, any time, there's no one parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the world, most of the city.
I'm in the narrative of this house, and I thought it's beautiful. I thought I was going to change my life for everybody.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
You've Joan and she was like a mother for me. You suddenly suddenly and unexpected.
I've done a lot about death, and I was a big death for my life, and I was big deaths about the things that are important to me in life.
But it's hard to me, these views, these views.
It's easy to lose in the alltagues and forget.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends, I wrote a side of the house of the house of house, and I wrote a snowlone, "Bevorite, I want to take away." Jer, I want to take a piece of crazy.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to experiment, but I was already the next day, the next day, and they're always wall.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the walls that were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to sure piratrics, I want to be a pirator."
"Bevor I want to sure, I want to stand up international datums."
"Bevor I want to singing for millions."
"Bevor I want to sure a tree, I want to plant."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netzunting."
"Bevor I want to sure them again, I want to hold them in my arms."
"Bevor I want to be stery, I want to be someone."
"Bevor I want to be sure I want to be very simply."
This is a laughtered place, and it became a sense of ortinary place, and the hope of people needed me to lead me to the wine and during me, for the hard time.
It's about knowing that you don't know that you don't alone.
It's about our neighbors and understanding and understanding a new and way.
It's about remembers for best, and for remembers and remember what we're doing is important, as we grow and change ourselves.
I've done this last year, and I've made a hundreds of people who want to build a wallowled with their community, and I wanted to build my colleagues and I've got a basically in the world, like Kolleague, like Can Africa, South Africa, South Africa
We've been using how much power our powerful places when we have the opportunity to share our voices.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with taking conditions is important than ever before, things that are important to think about the right bubble and think that life is currently.
We're often by the death, and we're going to talk about death or even just thinking about it, but I realized that the idea that the idea of the death is one of the death is one of the things that are strong us.
The idea of thought about deaths to death our life.
Our together, our places on the best, which is important to us as individuals and as a community. And with more important. And with more opportunities, and stories can't help us to share us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm approached me with a mathematics. A particular problem for everyone who are concerned with each other mathematics, is that we are as companies.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to explain the trial today, today, what I do.
Tances is one of the most activities.
We're decided to be approach of most of most half-clicks and soups, like you're going to see how you're going to see.
For ballet is a extraordinary big magnitude, and ability to capability, and possibility, and possible evention that could have a genetic components.
Trazy new stories like Parkinson's slowly new stories like Parkinson, and that makes them in my extraordinary family, who was a ballettuose.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the mistakes.
And yet, there's a worldwide 6.3 million people who are living in this disease, and they need to be increasible symptoms like symptoms like symptoms, symptoms that are disease.
We need to measure the research is objective massive, and finally, really, really, really, really, really, to know if we have a objective massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive master.
<unk>rigger is that there's no parkinson and other movements don't have a biomarker, so you can't just a biomarker. That's the best thing that there's 20 minutes.
You have to put it in clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very expensive, except that's never been done. No.
But what if patients could make these tests to make these tests?
That would be a hospital tour in the hospital tours. What if patients could make these test self-reproduced?
It wouldn't be a teures hospital.
It costs 300 percent, 300 percent, in the neurological approach.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods, with the methods that we're trying to reach the senses. Because we're all, because we're all of my recognize as my recognize.
Here you see a video of video of video.
This happens in the entire condition when someone laughters. We can look at our coordinary ballettle, because we have to look at all of these voice because we have to coordinate all of these voice, and we all have to do this game.
And as Ballets, it's enormously a lot of transmitation.
Think about how long a child, like a child, until it.
And by the loud of the vibrating vibrates, and as the position of the vibrators are also the voice of Parkinson.
On the other attention, you can see an example of unregular voice for unregular voice.
We're always see the same symptoms.
Voice, swallow, swallow.
The language is so living with time, and that's a language, and that's an example of it.
And this effects that can be minimal, sometimes, sometimes, but sometimes, sometimes, and presence, and presence, combined with new settle, combined with new lack of learning, which is very critical learning with new learning.
How can these tests with clinical messages? Well, they're not both-invasive. The test in Neurologists.
They're not going to be. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for this.
And both are exactly. There's not going to be the voice.
So you can make themselves by available.
They're very quickly, three-free seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also use it in great massive.
This amazing goals, we can do this.
We can reduce logistic swimeness.
Patients don't have to leave in clinics in clinics.
We can recognize whether we can recognition.
We can make a massive massive massive studies for clinical studies and first of all the population of the whole population of the whole population.
We have the opportunity to look at Biomarkers for biomarkers for the disease.
Today, we're doing the first step in this direction, we started the parkinson's swimming.
With Aculab and patients LikeMeeeech, we want to take a very high number of voices to voices for the world.
We have rooms that are dreived a billion people on this planet, people on this planet.
Everyone, without Parkinson, can be fully, can be recording to a few center to a few center. I've been known to frequently six percent of our goal is just a real-shours of our goal.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people, you can tell you who say, who's not going to say who isn't it?
What do you do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients have to give you approach to park if this parkinson's sorry. Okay. Okay.
Some of them may not be able to create it.
But we collect a huge database, under different environments, which is interesting. This is important. These are important, because we are increasingly important, which is the real marker for parkers.
At the time you have 86 percent of their 86 percent device?
It's much better.
My snaker Thanasis -- I have to love him because he's so fantastic works -- now has worked on the mobilks -- now it's also working on the mobilk, which is what this project, and we're incredible, and we're at 99 percent.
That's what I call a connection.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handy on the hand, and people can do with Parkinson could take their voice, their voice, so that you can take their doctor, so that you can take the doctor of the disease of the disease.
Good.
Thank you. Max Little, my dams and gentlemen!
Thank you.
Here's live in Kenya at Cenyairobi Nairobi Nairobi National Parks.
In the background, you see the kitchen of my father and the kitchen is the nairobi Nairobi Nairobi Nairobi Nairobi nairobi national Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the south of only in the south. That means that Wildtire, which means that Wildtire, as cebras the park every single time.
The reason that the solution, the solution, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They kill our vieties.
This is one of our kitchen that was killed. I wake up. I wake up and found it was great. It was a great box. It was our only box.
My stamm, the stamm of the Massai, that we're going together with our animals and the way together with our animals. That's why we came up with our animals.
I learned as a children.
Our warrior warrior, you know, you're protect our stamm and our hearts. They're also brought to the problem.
and kill the solution.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a nairobi national Park, just so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few so few holes.
In my stamm is a junny between six years, and new years for the kitchen for the kitchen. So it was also me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Lions. Lions for mechane.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to see the solution, but the cows to see the kitchen.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a bird.
I wanted to think the solution I thought I was still the cow.
But solve are very clean.
They come up, the vogels and go back. Because the next time. But they're going to come and say, "I don't go, that's not yes.
And they're doubt and killed our viety.
One night, I watched the stall. I love with a fackel in the hand around him, and this time, and this time.
Lions for me, light, the light, that's moving.
I had an idea.
I was a little boy, I worked all day in my room, and I took a new room and took my mother, and I took my mother. And I had took my mother. But I had a lot about electronics.
I took a old car, and I took a relationship of a motorrad. The regular, whether you want to left or left. He's blind.
And I was a shalter, and I was a switch and out of a box.
This is a little birne of a captain task grandpe.
And then I built everything.
The solar panel latery that battery, the battery, the battery. I call it a transformator. I call it a transformator.
And the direction of the relationship.
You can see that the birth, because of the birth, because of the solution.
And so it looks like this for the solution when they come.
The lights blink and the solution I believe that I've been going to believe that I was all the time in the bed.
Thank you.
I have this installed this way to home and since we had no problems.
And then our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and they asked me if I could ask her lights installing her lights installing.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the lights in the background.
And so I've seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights and they really good.
My idea is used to be used in all Kenya, also for other robtians like Hyenoparden or Leoparden. The lights. The lights of farms of farms.
My experience to me a stipending me to a stipendium in Kenya, Brookhouse in Cenya, Brookhouse international School, and I'm really excited to be in Cenya.
My new schools are engaged and helps themselves through language and recognition.
I even have my friends with my friends with home and common installing, we're not going to show the lights where there are no, and I'm going to show them how to use them.
I just a year ago, a boy of the Savanne, who was his father cows. I saw, and I saw, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a sit."
And here's what I'm going to do.
I thought, I was a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm great, I want to be airplane, and pilot. That's my great traum.
From, I have a solution. But by my invention, but by my father, I can save my father and the solution of my father, and we can live without side, without the lions, without streets.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language means that I thank you very much.
You know, you don't know how long it's like you're to hear a story like yourself.
So you've got this stipendium. Yes.
You work on other electrical superience.
What's the next on the list?
My next experience, I'm working on a electrical country. Aemaun. Aem?
Yes, I know, electrical columns are already long, but I want to found my own.
You've got to read it, you know, not trying to try to figure out, but I've trying to give you a break, because I got a snow.
All of the beginning is hard to richard animals, you're a little bit of something very best.
We're going to be in every step in every step, my friends, my friends.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm old enough to hold enough to hold, is photography my passion, but I want to share with you today with you 15 of my favorite, and no one of them.
There was no way of director, no style, no chance to be a picture of a picture. Not a picture.
To believe that most of them were created by most of the tourists of tourists.
My story begins when I started a talk for a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, on my daughter, and I was on my arm, and we were on my arm. We were on my arm.
And so a year later, we were in New York and so we decided to be able to same image.
Well, you can see what you can see.
When the third birthday, my daughter said, "Hey, why, why, why, why don't you're not going to New York and makes it a father-Tochter-Tochter-Tochter-Tochter-day?
And then we started to build a voice tourists to make an image of us.
You know, it's pretty much like universe is the lawyer is when you're going to be a completely freaking his camera.
Nobody has ever said, someone has ever been too lucky, and someone with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rice of our lives.
This journey is very hard today.
This is only after the 11st center, and I had to explain what happened in the day, and I had to explain what happens is that a five-year-old,
These images are much more than just a function, or a particular moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a way for us to be a week in the october, and how we changed our time and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical, but in everything in everything.
Because even though we do this same image, changes our perspective of mal. While they always new miles, as they're always seeing new miles, I'm going to see how they see it.
This very intense, this very intense that we're spending with each year, and every year we've been expecting.
Last, while after a our risk, we went to a suddenly, and suddenly, they suddenly asked them how they're going to show up a red market, they'd like a little kids, when they love to be a little kid, they love to love to be a little kid.
And she told me about their feelings that they had five-year-olds that they had this sort of smaller.
She said they remember how their hearts from the heart of the breast, when she saw the launch of the laden.
And now she looked in New York after High schools because they want to study in New York.
And I realized, I realized, the most important thing we all created, memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you to share a active rollege in the most important memory of memory.
I don't know how it looks like this, but I'm going to look at this 15 images, I'm on a families.
I'm always the picture.
I want to talk to you today today today with this image and getting youn't want to ask someone to ask you, "Would you do a picture of us?"
Thank you.
