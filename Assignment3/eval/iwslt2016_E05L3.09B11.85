When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clenes of the clenes.
My father hearing on his little roadio radio the news of the bBC.
He looked very happy, what was happy to do with what was pretty unusual, because the news of the neighborhood.
He rather, "The Taliban are writing!"
I didn't know what that means is, but it made my father, very, very, very happy.
"You can go to a right school," he said," he said," he said.
So the morning I never been sending.
A bad shock.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, and I was six, and I spent to school.
So I five years, I five years long as a junny and starting my older sister, my older sister, not all of your sister, and I don't go to a school.
So we could go to school.
Every day, we could never water, so that nobody could never went to where we were went to where we went to where we went to.
We were able to record our books in the left, so that we would go out of it as if we just go to the sell.
We were invited in a house, over 100 girls in a small wohn.
In the winter was after, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all know that we knew that we knew our lives: teachers and our parents.
In the suddenly, the difference of the difference for a week, because the Taliban Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Cancy.
We were never seem to be sure how much they knew about us.
Do they recorded?
Why do they know where do we know where?
We had afraid, but we wanted to school.
I had a great decided in a family in a family, and tilled as important as important.
My grandfather was his time.
At the outside of a decided provinced province Afghanistan. He was basically -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and I was fathered by his father.
My mother, but I was born, but it was a teacher.
That's what they are.
Two years ago, she went into the rhestand, just to girls for money and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this was the first in his family, who was ever slide, who's ever recovery.
For him was clear that his children were a children would be a children, also his daughter, even the taliban, trotcy, drops all risks.
He looked like a much biggest risk of his children don't go to school.
I know that I know that I was in the years, sometimes, sometimes even the taliban, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective,
I was good lustered to be a good lust. But my father said, "Thather, you can hear it in your life.
No money can be done. You can be in the war, you can be in the war.
But one thing is going to be done, which is always going to be here. And even if we have to be able to remote with our bloods, we need to do that.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country on a country that was destroyed by war.
With less than 6 percent of my alters have a higher than the second baby as the secondary, and if my family, and if my family for my schoolbulbing for my school.
Instead, I'm going today, as a stolvention of the Middlebury College.
When I was after Afghanistan, my grandfather who was in the family who was sended by his family, because he was a bad, he was to school, one of the first one of the first one who was the first one of the first one whole thing that was the most family.
He doesn't just smart with my high school, but also that I was also the first woman who was the first woman who was the first woman, and I'm the first woman.
My family family.
I have a great trees, but my family has still bigger animals for me.
So I'm global bottom lobal bottom of 10x10, a global campaign of women.
So I've been able to make SOLALALA, and maybe some internat for might be a few Internat for money in Afghanistan, a country, in the school.
It's wonderful to see how the south of my school with great earning with great earning all of them.
And to see how their parents and variety and variety, as I'd been able to do my parents and decided to be able to decisions.
So as Ahmed. That's not being name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my father.
At the months were his daughter and heimed on the home of SOLA in their village and they're the todle of the todies of minutes.
When he was home, he came up, the telephone and a voice, he was going to be a voice, he would go to school, she would try to school, they would try to try it.
And he said, "The said, "There, but I'm not going to be the future of my daughter on the future of my daughter and more older and overcome."
What Afghanistanistan, so I realized something that I've been able to be able to be the west often, most of us, the most successful, the father, the father, and the water, and the wood is the first police of his daughter.
That's not to be able to play our mothers don't play in our success.
And then they're holding the projects that are possible for a lot of different future, and over a lot of their daughters. But in a society like the in Afghanistan is the university of the men's in the mense.
The taliban went to the taliban mirds of girls -- because it was somebody -- because it was some illegal.
But today, everybody in Afghanistan, three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so differently.
The Americans are recognize how to change our change.
I think that the change that the change are not from the daughters and recording to the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I'm slowly in my shoes, and their parents that they're going to use their parents that they're going to make a lot of parents that I see a lot of future and a long-time.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope and the uncomfortunity, and it's impossibilities, and it's the SOLALALALALALALALALALALA.
And as I think they have a big dreams.
Thank you very much.
All I do, also, also, also, I was basically -- my life was born in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, I see, I see young, but I'm not -- I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Cenia, Algeria, Algeria and Somalia and Somalia, with African countries.
I've been working for a nRO, and every single project that we're going to put on the legs that we're going to be able to record.
I was slow.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people and good work in Africa, and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we were all.
Our first project, which is what my first book "Ripples from the Atambe," inspired inspired, a sambias, which we wanted to show you how nuclear.
We came up with Italia satelly southern South America, in this hard Tal, which is what the sambia, which is the sambia. We live the animal population of the animal tales and collectional tomates and collection.
Of course, the answer to the an interesting thing about it, so we didn't have an interesting them for the work, and sometimes they also taken them.
We were amazing that it was in a so early translated talue.
But instead of asking why they were nothing to say, "God, we just said, "God," we're here!"
"Gerade, the right time to return the people to save people."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these practices. In Italy, they were so big, they were so big, in Sambia so big.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Sook, like skin, like simple country."
When the tomates were red, and I got about 200 nights about 200 nights and flew up all the flow and flew everything.
We said, "Oh God, "Oh God, the nilpferred!"
And they said, "Yes, we have no landworks."
"Why didn't you say, "I'm not going to be used to us."
I thought, we were so greater, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans doing what the English, which made the Franzanozing, which I was data, I was data, I was pretty strong.
We five to the five of the nilp fight.
They should see the university -- you should see the university that we don't see the United African people.
They should be the book "Tead Aida Moyo," it's a sambic economic economic economist.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have been removed the African continent 1,5 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has this money.
Let's just their book.
Lester you have a African, which we have to have what we've been story.
We are important people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, like we're just two species, or we're patriarchy.
Both walks from the latinic wurzel "pather" which means "Vather" means "Vather"
But they have two different conditions.
Patriarchal: I'm treating everyone each culture, they would be my children. "I love my children.
Patronizing: I'm treated everyone each culture, they would be my dia.
And so, white people are going to be away in Africa, Chef, Chef,
I was watched when I was the book "Small," by school," from school," he said, he said, "That's not going to go to the economics, if people don't want to go to the ruhead.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is Respect.
Today, the morning of the herror, the conference, a stab on the ground and asked, "Can you're a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react with people, and he's called a system called companies, which never been initiated initiated initiated, but never ever motivated, but you're going to be the distribution of the personal person who are the personalistic.
What you do -- you do -- you're going to do.
You never really never been a community with ideas, you're going together with the same simic.
We don't work from bread.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in cars.
We don't have infrastructure.
We fly found friends and find out what the person wants to find what the person.
The most important is the passion.
You can someone else a idea of a idea.
If you don't like that person to do what do you do?
The person for the own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The person for the own growth is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find that knowledge that never can be recognize everyone can be successful.
The person with the idea hasn't the knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this one: Why, why would we do to say what they should do to say what they should do to say why they shouldn't wearn't hear it? But not in community.
Let me give you a brain.
There's a problem with community.
We never have never been participate and they're never saying what they're going to say what they want to do with their money for money to see what they're going to see.
Planation has this blindow.
The most people are clearly knows that you don't know because they're never public trees.
We're working to do this to do this to do this, to do this social infrastructure, not existed.
A new basically, a new box.
This is the house of the company, the house of the bedombes, who's in the house, in your caf<unk> and in the caf<unk> and in the caful, you're going to find your passion in a way that the lives.
I have this in the food, West Australia, trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do this in the world.
I was promoved to the time and trying to get out where we should say what to do, what they should say what to do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had the first year, and he had three days, and I had my first customers. I'm him. He was him. He was Mori. I was a morix. I was him to get a restaurant in Prantaurants and himself and to help.
I'm half of these fishes and working this wonderful throw this wonderfish in Albany for 60 Cents, but for 60 Cents, but for 15 dollars for 15 dollars for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government. The government, "How do you do this?
How do you. I said, "I'm doing something very, very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and highly."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Mach you."
We've done it in 300 genemics.
We have 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are involved in the unitude.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the story, story, story, story,
Peter pressure was Philosophyprofessor, before he was involved with company. Peter Drucker said, Peter Drucker said, in fact, in fact, independently increasingly."
Planation is the death of the company.
So you build Christian to know what the cover know what the christians with their money with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to a to get to a tool.
You have to help them to help them to help them to help them. You have to help them to help them to help them to help them, and they're going to get them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people ago, the intelligence?
For what presentation have the presentation of most effects?
<unk>rible, easy people. They have applications.
I want to say that company is that company is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- night fossil fossil fuels, fully -- and suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly,
The consumption is not a sustainable.
The friends of the instandent is not afterward.
We need to look at how we need to look at the same time we can record them to be able to corres, transporting to corresponding them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who will be the technology for the green revolution? Universities? Are you?
The government? Compose!
It's going to be afford. And they're going to do it.
I'm a food story in a future in a food story in a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were embracted to the future of New York New York New York in the 1860 to best.
In 1860 came together and speculated what happens in 100 years with the city of New York. The slusion was a reality: The stad of New York, the city wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? You see the curve, and they said, when the curvey, when the population in this tempoints, they needed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Because they went on the mistake.
At 1860, they see the most important technology that life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, 19001, there were 1001 Automobily -- 1001.
The idea that a different technology to find a different technology, the running. There was little fabrics in the backland.
Darborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a brain, to work with companies.
When he has to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
They don't get them and talk to you.
As next to them, you have to turn them together and empathy.
Then you have to tell them the absolutely truthority.
From the smallest firma, all have to be able to be able to get three things: That's to buy product, the product, the consumption, the consumption, and the financial and the financial.
Rather you?
We never had a single person who can do something that can produce something that can produce something that can buy the money and to make the money.
That's not exists.
This person was never been done.
We have found the research and we wrote the 100 iconic firms of the world -- Carnegie, Westing, Edison, Fords, Google, Google, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle, Goo
There's just a thing that allows all the first companies of the world's just a single companies, just one person who was just one person.
Now, we're going to live 16-year-old companies and we started the universe, and we started to give them the first two side of Richard Branson Autobiography. The autonobiography. The first time it's about 16-year-olds.
Nobody's "If" and 32 mal "wir"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody's a company of all. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we make a community, in the middle, who have a little bit of a little bit of Hinterground, and Bars, and your engaged caful, and your engaged couple of these guy, which has to do what someone is the possible.
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you buy it? Can you recognize the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "May I don't know that I'm going to finish?"
We activate general communities.
We have groups of freedom that can be under the companies that can be under the companies, and people who have found the middle of the middle of the middle of the intelligence of the intelligence of the intelligence, and that the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be age how it must be age, alice in the wonderful.
The penn State University is a doceration -- a Dozin for communication -- in the communications in communications.
I had angry --
It's not afraid of these students with their big brain and their big brains and their books and their books, not told me.
But as the conversation of the conversation, it's like Alice, as they were looking at the cannins and a cannins and a door to a whole new world.
I felt like, I felt like I was talking about the students. I was introduced. I was going to believe that they had to be the other wonderful that other wanted to be able to decided to be that other words.
I think that takes to open this door, it's great communication.
We need to make surely important communication of our scientists and ingenery and ingenery to change the world.
Because our scientists and ingenery, the most important problems that our great problems, like, energy, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't understand it. I don't think it's not believe it in our consciousness than our consciousness.
But these great conversation, not to get our scientists and insures, if our scientists and in their wonderful.
So scientists and ingenery, bits, bits us.
I want to show you a few answer, how to make it, how to see that we can see that the science and the technology and technology and technology and technology and planet.
The first question that you have to be answered, is, Na and?
Sagtime, why we're just a scientific buildings so relevant for us.
Sages don't just believe that their drawings, but also tell us that their draws that their draws, the masters in our cooks, because they're important to understand the opportunity to understand opportunity.
And if you do that, what you do, what you do, then you're doing.
Afterwards are a hands are a history of the idea.
Sure could you use their oilar and pretty much, but why don't you just say, "Ruma and time you don't just changed for us?
Our thought, in fact, it's not the same as their nive as their nive.
As a serious thing said, "Mache the things like this, but not just as possible."
You can tell us something about eye, something about eye, without scientific compromise without the compromise.
A few things are piece of things are, instance: Because stories and analogies, and analogies. As you could get to us in your banned in your banned.
And if you're working on the work, then the stories, the stories.
Habt you ever ever been asked, why it's "Stichpected"?
What happens when someone's going to be a different? One other people, and with these points, and with these points.
A following this is not just long, but also too much language, but also too much more in our brain, and we're going to be able to faster.
These example of geneview of Geneview is much we're going to show that the special structure of the trabe of the trabeceles of the trabe, so it's so stability of the effecture of the effecture of the effecture.
The trick here is a single thing to use a single sentence, and they can use the audience when it's audience, orientists, orientients, orientific boxes and graphics, and the other senses of our others and graphics.
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these animals and the wonderful thing that science and the technology and technology in the technology.
And so the insures that I've been involved me to tell me, with the <unk>Nerday in meeting with a connection, I want to make all with a same with a same.
At the euroscience is economics and eventually, and eventually, so that's the rules of the audience, and multiplicated what's important to the same thing that's important to be incredible for their economics. And that's incredible.
So scientists and insures, if you're same up, you know, clearly increasing me.
Thank you very much.
Hi. That's my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a cell phone cancer a cell phone in Syria.
With a cell phone can tweet a news and a protesta work in <unk>gyped.
And with a handy can take a song, you can take a sound in SoundCloud and books.
All that's what's possible.
I'm year, I'm sample in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
And you can see how hundreds of people are hundreds of people for change in the streets and the constrated.
We are in 1989, and we're going to be able to remember that people who had changed in the tasks, a handy in the task.
Who in Saal has a handy?
Half you high.
Half you high-and phone, you high!
Half you high. One, a bubble, a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a cell phone.
But today, and my handy talk about my handy and about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about it.
These are 35830 cells of information.
Rohdata.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the Eur.U.
These right is called Right Right?
These rather than any particularly, every telephone in Europe, everyone in Europe, everyone in the entire Europe, a bandbreaker information.
Who is it? Who is it? Who is a email?
Who sentence a sMS?
And if you're using a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years of your telephone or your telephone or your Internet, or your Internet.
And everywhere in Europe are people on Europe, and we don't want to say, "That's not."
They said, we said, we want to be these idea.
We want to be sky ourselves in the digital time and we don't want to be the telephone and internet and Internet, and internet, all of these information about specifications about specifications.
There were anwers, Journalists, Journalists who all said, "That's not want to say, "That's not going to go."
And here you can see how 10 times of thousands of people on the streets and said, "Freeth and said, "Freeth."
And some of them said, this could be the state of 20.
The state was the brain was the brain in Ostitutes.
And I asked myself, whether it really works.
Can you really want to reach all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy business?
So I asked my telephone, the drugs that the drugs that the great telephone that was the greatest telephone in Devestmental free, and I asked them, and I asked them to me.
And I asked them a time and she asked them and he didn't get a right answer. Nurer's a little bubble.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is protocolled.
So I decided to make a general directly, they wanted to make these information because I wanted to have these information.
But the duter science said, no, no, we're going to give these information.
At the end of the same thing with them.
I'm going to go back to the beginning of what they all sended me told me.
Because in the fundamental magnification of the mountains that the emotion of the empower.
So I'm going to tell this half-making environment with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35830 cells information.
First, I saw it, and he said, it's half a huge date. My. My.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I be involved?
Because you see where I'm going to see where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the publicity of the public.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show what people's called the idea of what's called means.
So with time, with time, and Open Data City, so I've data City.
This is a visualization of sex months of my life.
You can reincooms and race, you can record and you can return back and back to the puls.
You can do every step, I can do, I do after.
And you can see how I can see from Frankful, and as many years, and how many five years, and how many anticipation I'm going to make it.
All that's possible to this information.
That's a little bit of a little bit.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
First, it's just as I call my wife and she calls me, and we're talking about a few mal with each other.
And then I called a few friends and they call a friends.
And after a while you and you're called this huge communication, and we have this huge communication.
But you can see how people can communicate with each other, they're going to go to bed them a country, they go to Bettle.
You can see all this.
You can see the central figures, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you can see the information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have to currently, you can construct the society.
This is a big plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect evolved in the perfection of how to red, because you can talk to the white, who's a possible, who's possible when you're possible when you've got to this information.
And these information are going to be six months, in Europe, in Europe, in Europe.
As I said, we're going to say that all of these people in the streets in the street in 1989 Handys in 1989 Handys in their dases.
And the state of the state, who was in the demonstration of the demonstration, and when the state of the state, who are never happened to be the leaders, that maybe this maybe never happened.
The case of the baller maybe not being stattle.
And also, not the case of the case of the ice.
Because today, as many information and companies, so many information, how many information can be survey, infline and often infline.
They want to be able to recognize our lives, and they want to read all the time.
But self-beship and a life in your life in your life, are not a widers are not a word.
But you have to be able to turn the self-bestime.
They have to be colleagues.
So if you go home, you say, you say that Privity is that privacy is a waiting of 21st century, and that this is not old.
If you go home, you say, you're going to tell your attacks and state the possibility of the opportunity to specific information, they don't do it.
And if you don't think you're not believe your telephone, you have to record the information that they have seen over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you're using your handy, you remember the self-based on the digital time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoes, snellrestaurants, breakfast.
So the city planer, so the city and overloading the names South Central Central, so he's what they change in South Los Angeles, as if that changed in the city of the city of the city of the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituoids, snellrestaurants, breakfast.
So in 265 million other Americans, I live in the food South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive Central Los Angeles and the Drive bybys.
The comic is that the driving drive-thruse more people than the drive bones.
People are south Central Los Angeles in South Central Los Angeles.
The father is crate in my food is clear. B. Five males, it's about 15 billion hills, the circa 15 circa.
I couldn't go to the more withans.
And I asked me how to feel like you would have no curiously food if you had no curious food when you'd have to see any mal, if you look at the house of the house of your house, the best experience.
I'm selling that role and I buy the role and sells like buyings.
I see Dial Dialysecial progresses like starbucks.
And I realized that the stopped that the stopped.
I capture that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
At the other thing I had no luster on 45 minutes, to get a four-five-foot to get a pesticians in the pesticians.
So I was picked a food value of my house.
It's a park, the parkanels we call Parkanlage.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing that it's the city.
But you have to make it pleasure.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is because it's my responsibility."
And I decided to hold it in standing.
So I came up and my group, the LA. Areas, and we started together and we started together, and own food, and opportunity, so that's all the program, so that's all the program, so that community.
We're a kind of idea of group, together, together, and all of these social shapes and from all the city, it's free, and all of the cost of all, and everything we do, and everything we do,
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone who was someone.
The city came up to me and he told me and he said that I had told me that I had told my garden, and he said that I had to be a rich,
And I thought, "Come, right?
A rich interesting effects of food in a country of food, the early land, the real country?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herman."
Because this mal wouldn't go to the mality.
The LA. Times, Wind, Wind, Steve Lope, and I was a story about it, and talking about the city and talking to the city of Green Brat and they were a petition. They were a petition.
We'd give you the hands.
My stratch, and he said that they're support, and he said they're support, what we do.
So, why should they do that?
LA.A. He's the United States most states in the city of the city.
They're 67 million breaks.
These are 20 central Parks.
That's enough enough to power to power to pants.
Why do they shouldn't find the top of it?
And so you can get a plant, you know, you're 1,000 sames.
With the box in the wert of a dollars in the wall and green own value of 75 dollars.
It's my hybots, I say they should believe their own food.
His your own food is like his own money is like his own money.
You see, I have a conversation in South Central.
I'm going to start there. I have my skin there.
And I know, part of this part of this part of this prediction of the other people who were fabricity and I was fabricians.
You see, I'm a artist.
Garden work is my graffiti. I'm public.
All right like a graffiti-cluding change, the waller, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm a parkanla.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of piece, and the plants and the flowers are my fully.
They would be used to use what the Earth, if you can use it as a line.
You can't imagine how it's a sunlume is a sunlume is, and how people are books.
So what happened?
I've been experienced to a instrument for the instrument and the result of my fourth.
To the community to change the community of the ground.
We are the ground.
They would be wonderful, how children are going to be conflict.
Garden is the therapistic and coast, and coast, because you can do, particularly in the city.
And then you're wrote approach.
I remember this moment, when this mother and their daughter and their daughter, and they were came up in my garden, and I came out, and I came out.
I'm smelling me, because they were smart, and I said, "Wis, you know, you have to do that.
The garden is not without the street."
I've been asked when I saw people were so close to me, and I've been sured me, and that's just asked me, "Fin, people don't have a food, you don't have a food."
And I said, "Thy, no, no, I don't know what they're not afraid.
And so it's not on the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take her healthy, I want to take their health."
At the other time I was living a garden in this object in Downtown LA.
These are the guy who have been helped me to decided to decided to decided to decided to decided to decided to decided to decided me.
It was cool and they share their stories about how it has been influence and how they've been influence and how they've been done with their mother and it was great, and it was a moment.
Green reason about 20 generated about 20 generated.
First of our environments came up so 50 people and doing this, and they're all freedom.
If you children, it's eating children.
If they tomates, they eat, they eat.
But if they don't get to get it, if they don't get together when they don't get the food and body eat, and it's always trying to food whatever you're always translated.
I see people who want to work, people who want to work, but they want to be in this thing -- I see, I see, I see the same children who are exactly the planet, and they're going to go on.
The garden, I see the mind, where we can train them to create these children can train their communities to care their communities to lead after life.
And if we do that, who know who know who knows?
We could take the next George Washington Carverton Carver.
But if we don't change the collection of the Earth, we're never doing this.
So this is one of my planet. That's what I want to do.
I want to be a whole wocked a whole plants, where people can share the food in the same bubble.
I want to take school and I want to take them in health and they're using it into health.
So, don't understand me.
I don't talk about costlessly, because it's not sustainable.
The comically involved that you have to be able to be able to be able to behavior.
I'm talking about people to give people who are working and children from the streets, and they're going to make the street and the ears and the early, if you're going to make your own food, and if you building business.
So what I want to do is to do is this is the sixy.
I want to believe that we all ocological rebell, Gangster, Ganger.
We need to be able to reach the picture of Gang.
If you don't have a ganger.
All right, you're going to be sell, you know?
And let's the waffected to be the choice.
If you want to make meeting meeting me, you don't want to make meeting inquences and a meting and a meting where you want to talk about it.
If you want to make meet meet you want to get your sky, and you can do anything that we can pick up with some site power.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite switchwork of English World English World English World.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No,"
Although, in 19th century, a newspaper of a better definition: "Ein Snollygoster is someone who's someone who's someone who's a couple of parian, program or line, program or line, and his matter.
I don't have a similar."
I think about World, I think I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all politicians that they're trying to control.
At 171, for example, the British Parlament, the British Parlament, not the exactly the design of the driver.
And that's actually crazy back to the mother couple of a man with the eye of Brass Crosby, who was with the plament.
They were him in the Tower of London and later, but he was a mutut enough, he was mutut enough enough to reach enough, and he was so much until he had been so much until he was so much until he was so much unlution.
And just a few years later, we find the first night, we find the first night, "so strong as Brass" as Brass"
Brassive water on the English word for Blech.
But that's not true. It's not going to go back to a press of pressure.
But to show you how words and politics and politics are slowing you to take you in the United States, when they're just reached to the unability.
You see, you look at the question of what you should call the state of Washington, the state of the state.
You know, you know,
How do you call the leaders of a republic nation?
And that was in Congress in Congress,
And there were all kinds of possible to be available.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouverton, and other, other, and other, other, and others, and others, and others, and others of the United States of America,
Not so a consumption.
Some people wanted to call him.
They thought that's while.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to be the certain time.
It would have been working.
But everybody was unbelieved, because these distribution, because these draged 3 weeks.
I have the days of a senators, the stranger who is, "Immer the same is the same thing.
The reason for the population and the long long time, the representation was the representation.
The representation is not going to be that what's going to do is not going to be. They didn't want to do it.
Can you call them, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
They wanted to give them the most powerful, the most painting, the most painting of them.
This guy was "President"
President. They didn't existed the title. He's existed. But he's sure that someone else.
So something like the idea of a jury.
He hadn't have more reason than the reason, "Anter" or "Apasser" or "Apasser."
Sometimes, there were president smaller colonial community and governments, but it was a unbed by dealing title.
That's why he could sentence.
They said, "That's lowerful, you can't call him.
This climbs have to get away and explored countries and expressed.
Who will take him, if he's going to take a dummines like President of the United States?"
And also after three weeks, the senatence.
Instead of the same thing that you can't use the title of the case, but they wanted to use the clear, but they wanted to make it away from their own recognize the methods.
You can learn about three interesting things.
First, I think that, and I didn't have the best -- I don't have anything that the senat once, even the title President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just just just after the title.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says that something temporary -- then you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Third, and that's really important thing that's important point, the most important point of the United States of America" of America" is not so much more like that?
This has a little more than 5,000 nuclear popular color, and the greatest volunteers and the greatest volciety of the world and a photograph and a flower.
And it's really a story and story of the title.
And so the senat on the end of the end of the end.
They have a respectables.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of events -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound how the climbs with the 5,000 nuclear sprength.
So the end of the senat and the representation and the representation, because no one is never felt that you're going to feel that you're going to be the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take with what you can do with me.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality to control the reality, but actually changes the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came in a laster with about 50 rebeing a campaign of Dalabadad campaign -- a 19-year-old surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I thousands of my black Converse Converse Halbrary country and fire country and fire in regards, and I couldn't even see a rocker that I couldn't see a pances that I couldn't see a pair.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
Long, I was a long time I was written with the war, all of the war, and footprints, and Football physics and footprints and footprint with risk and religional south and religional data.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to be here, I'm southe, Southe, Southe-Proletes Godes. Atheist and atheist and a radical artists, the last new jobs that's been working in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of good things that we could do is a lot of things about the art, but I couldn't make personality, but I want to make artificial art, and I want to make the personality and cars and cars and carrying the reality and high-fority and recoversity.
I want to spend a day in life of a dictionary -- Gangland, who's the vihad city like <unk>Popstar Bling Bling Bling Bling, and political corruption and political corruption.
And what's sunster can do is doing the danger than the parlament to candidate and a choice and a choice with the Slogan: "What's doing."
And trying to use these campaigns to use these mafiosiosiosiosisiosity as national highelf.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and they're going to go to the project, "Ruck" instead of the policists, a false of control.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan, I want to be after the "modic conflict.
The war and the war and the free of the free, which is a new environment, a new environment for style and mode a model that you can only a model of the soldiers and self-collection of soldiers, and I cancer.
And I would like to see how a simple simple simple chubcarrees of cabulating Appelling Appelled the cabularly of 18999, that the hoth development of their own evolution in the color.
But for all these things can come in the prison, they can be missed, they can be missed.
But I'm doing because I have to be slow the opposite of self-low.
That's my favorite. Which is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I've been working as a model.
Second years, just as well.
I have the sense that now is now in the room is in the space where I couldn't have this cleider to make this cleides.
I've been a little bit about something that I have a little bit about it.
This is the first time you can see someone on TED books on TED books, so you can see, so you can see, so I think you can see.
If you really women really women really, when I was really switching me to say that I don't have to say that I'm not going to twitter.
I also think I'm really privileged that I can change in very course, because I can change 10 seconds, which you think about me.
There's not everybody has the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good, it's good that I didn't want to be able to do.
The most difficult part of my head is to cover about my head, because then you'll all of my head, because you're allowed me to do anything about my head.
In order.
Why did I do that now?
That was pretty.
Well, it wasn't hopefully as this picture.
At the powerful, but a powerful.
I've just changed your minds in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never really never been a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photography, I said, I would be solve my hand in the hand in the hand in the hair.
And then, from operations or the wrong or the wrongs that I've been two days ago, there are two tages of our own possibilities, and our own possibilities, and our own possible -- whether it's operately impact -- whether it's a big lives -- and our lives -- and
For explains to be hot to be today.
And I'm standing on this book because I'm a moodel.
I'm standing on this book because I'm a high woman, and in my branch, and in my branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me, but on the real kind of real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I always say, "Oh," but I was nothing," but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, is a violence in the genetic lottery and maybe you're going to ask you, and maybe this experience.
Now, in the last few century, we didn't just as health and young and symetrically defined, we're biological programs are programmed, but also hospital, but also hospital.
This experience was a same for me. And it's a same thing for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models: "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Luy. Like. Liuy. Well.
And I'm going to comment your model-where, science.
But I've got to tell you that in 2007, that in 2007, a very at the nYU.
The next question that I always been telling me, "Cann I'm going to be a model, if I'm going to grow up?"
And I'm not going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I really want to be a little girls, "Why?
Do you know what? You can be all be.
You can be presidentin the U.S., or the U.S. or the next Internet or a ninja-Herzer, which is a ninja-Docraft, because then you would be the first."
If they're still saying, "No, no, no, no, no, Cameron," I want to say, "Who," then I say, "Who," I'm going to say, "Who."
Because I don't have a responsibility and you couldn't be the carrier of American vogue or the business or the next samp; or the next sunteven misel.
To say that you're going to be a model, you want to say that sometimes you're saying that you want to be a pottoto the lottototo the lottoto.
You can't implicated and it's not a career and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I'd like to knowledge, because other than herful as a heart of different than himself.
If there's a photography, and that's just like a nice, and the couple of courage, and the cameron, we want to go to the picture, and then you can go to the box, and then you go to the poor, and then you go to the poor.
It looks like this.
Hopefully more comic than the middle.
That was ... I don't know what happens.
If you're going to be a life and a life, and you can't done, you can't have much more saying, if you're not much more saying, "Well, you're going to be a lot of the United States, but you're going to go to the <unk>10 years old.
The next question that I've been older, "What's all photos returned all photos?"
And yes, so pretty much of photos are returned, but that's just a little part of the stories.
That's the most picture I did, and that's also the most of the most painting that I had a biciniode. I hadn't even even my piode.
I know that's going to be pretty personally, but I was a young girl.
So I just looked at a few months from my grandmother.
That's what I'm on the day.
My friends, I had to start with my friends.
That's what I'm on a py, a few days ago, a few days before a shooting for the early.
That's what I'm going to do with the footprint and in the V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's constructed and it's constructs a group of profis, from Haune, and Make-up covers and photographs and photographs and stylists and the stylists and the production.
Okay, as a next thing that people say, "Cree things you're always dropped me?"
Yes, I have too many 20-cm-crazy, which I never met, but the things I could never met, but the things I'm going to get things that I'm going to be able to remain things that I'm not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day I went to a day and one day, and I had my money, and you had the cambridge for the cambridge for the cambridge.
When teenagers, I went to my friends with my friends, and they were able to red a rod and of course, and of course, we needed a red, and of course, "It've got a master," and we could do more likely.
I have these costs of my evidence, and not because of my personality and not because of my personality and there are people who are people who are a high-time personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and I was filtered, 85 percent of the latinos and latinos and most of the men.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men's not the question, for the question, "Who I'm not going to be the question?"
And so, "How often I'm going to go to the wanted to go to the wanted?"
And I found my researchers for these talks that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of their body in the United States in the United States, and that number 17 percent when they're 17 percent.
The last question of me, "How is it, how is it?"
And I think they're expecting these answer: "If you're going to be a little bit and glenders and global harm, you feel very happy and fabulful and fabulful and fabulful."
And Backstage, we're going to give this eventually, maybe this event.
We say, "It's really great, so much to reison, and it's greative people inspiring inspiring people."
All that's true, but it's just the story of the story that we never say what we never say, "I never say, "I've never said, "I've never said, "I feel like me."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think about my exactly.
And if you ask you ask you, "What would I be happy if I'd be happy, if I had you have a lot of hearing harm?"
Then you should make a few models, because they have the thins they have the most dinner and the most global cool and the cool cool cool cool, and they're the cool cooler.
When I wasn't a lot of time, he's very difficult to me, a very difficult bilances, because one of them, because I felt very uncomfortable, I'm very uncomfortable, and I'm going to be able to tell you about the stapture of my gapture." And I was felt.
It was very difficult, it was very difficult to help away from unfortunately, and race, if I'm one of the greatest nuts of it.
But I'm also happy and felt like I'm going to tell you what I'd believe it, and I've been able to do it here, before 10 or 30 years or 20 or 30 years or 30 years or 30 years, and then I wouldn't have told me, because I wouldn't have my career.
If you take something with this talk about this talking about this variety that we all the power of the imagination in our powerful experience and following.
Thank you.
I've never been the words of my grandmother never been done in the exilience is, "Son, list, "Son, list.
But who never never been to be something like a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
Now, it's almost two years, since the liby research is inspires of revolution, inspires of the waves of the massive in the oldestic revolution.
I spent to many other libyers, with many other libyers, and a half a day to cyensive libyensive and to start a revolution and to start the tyrannic revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
June, liby women and men and men in the first range of the first range, the end of the range of the range of the range of the freedom, and social generality, and social generality.
They've been able to treat mutes, by turning themselves by the brutal dictature Gaddafis.
They have a strong sense of solarity, from the most farmers, from the farmers, until the south.
Finally, after a time of six months, and almost 50,000 tote and five to our country and free days and the tyranches and the tyranch.
But Gaddafi has a big big brought a big branne, a corruption and the corruption and the reason for corruption.
Four decades, Gaddafis Tyrannic Regime, the infrastructure, as the culture, as the moral structure of the lybic structure of the lybic society.
The consciousness and the challenge, I asked how many other women, I as many other women who are recording society, we're recording to build available and we're not going to be able to decisional and never community.
So to 200 organizations were during the case and unmediately after the case of Gaddazi, almost 300 in Benghazi.
After 33 years in Exil, I came back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasmusiasmusiasmus, I started to the topic capacity, human education, human education and leaders.
With a wonderful group of women, I was the Freezer, I was a movement liby women, a movement of women, family of women, the course of life, the goal of the public public public public public public public publ
And I met applications, I met up a very difficult environment, a environment, which is always strong, and a couple of the egoistic politics of Dominan and explained.
I'm set up a person who are involved by women, and I'm a women, to reach a laws, a law, a law, and each brought to be a law, and the regular political citizens and country.
At the end of our initiative about our initiative.
Women women women 175 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But long as the eye, but the euphory of the weeks and the whole revolution, we thought we were growing news.
A lot of morning, we thought about changes and suffering the money and Sufi Gralter Mozer.
And we're going to explain news about the Mordinary on the Mordican bottom and the angriffic.
And again, again, the morning of opening the army of opening.
And we really expect every day, we're looking at the miliary of milium and their others and their opportunity and their mission of regulations and laws.
Our society, basically, in a revolutionary, polarized and decided to be able to revolution, and principle freedom, social generality, social genderships.
Intolerancy, exception and race, and Rache, the idea of the revolution.
I'm not going to be able to talk to you today with the successful, our recognize our records and the choice.
And I'm a lot of time today, that we've been as a nation that we've been decisions and the wrong decisions.
We've been able to be false.
Because the choice of wars, the writing stability or sure of the United Stability.
Hat the reason is the river and the way of the way between the way between candidates and men national wars and national various candidates?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why will our society is going to be polarized by self-sistance politics of the dominance and the exclusion of men, and the exclusion of men?
Maybe the women didn't have the only thing that has been the female of the female of the middle of the middle of the middle.
Our society needs a national dialogue and conservational dialogue as they've done the numbers that are just the end of the end of the polarization and decision.
Our society needs to be the qualitative construction of the website more than they need to be a number of the website of the female.
We need to stop in the name of the name of the corning and a day of the roach.
We need to be able to make the name of the middle and the gnade.
We need to develop a white discovery the following woods, but also wouldn't just too, but also to record, it's also working on the constattle, collaboratory, instead of course, instead of course.
These are the ideal that are the ideal war, the idea of warription lybia to get free peace to reach friends.
Because the war has a alchemy and in this alchemy and in this alchemics and masculines and masculines.
That's the real reason.
And we need to existence we need to do it, before we do it sociopolitical.
After a vision from the Koran "Salam" -- Free" -- Freece "ister's the word "The God."
The word "The Arahamic Traditional Traditional Tradition is, this same Arabic Wortrabic Wortrabic Wortrah" and symbolized "Mother female," and symbolismbolized the personality of humanity and the humanity of humanity of humanity,
And just like the mother carry, the embryo, which is the most completely to him, it's the reason of the middle of the middle Existence.
And so that's why we said, "My Gnade all things."
And so this is why we said, "My Gnade has been a great idea."
So we're going to be the general of the gunnade.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country, and I went to the best of the world, and I went to the lower.
And I was very strong.
In school, we have the story of Kim Il-Sung, but we learned not very much about the world, but we learned that America, South Korea, South Korea and Japanese are our focus.
And even though I was often asked me how the eye is, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until the northern America.
With they saw years, I saw a public head, but I thought, but I thought my life in North Korea,
My family wasn't work, and I had to be a hunger.
But in 1995, my mother was a letter of the Swester of a college.
Darin stood: "If you're going to be our five five five five family, because we don't have two weeks, because we didn't have anymore.
We love together and our body are so hard and our body are so hard."
I was so hocked.
I heard to hear the first time I heard that people in my country.
I went to the bahness, I went to the bahness, and I didn't get more from my memory, I can't solve anymore.
A small woman woman on the ground, and a couple of child in their army in their army in their poor.
But no one who were half-cluded because all of them were so support to care their families and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hungry in North Korea.
At the end was more than a million North Koreaner's prediction of the open, and many more further, and many more and many more further and based on the bottom.
Strom thousands were always been highly, so that's what it's going to be the lights of China on the other side of China on the other side of the U.S.
I always wondered why they had light, and we didn't.
This is a satellite of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the flower of the river, the part of the border between North Korea and China and China and China.
As you can see, the flower of the flower and he's very important northern Koreans.
But many sters.
Sometimes I saw people in the flower in the flow.
I can't tell much about how I can tell you that North Korea, but I can tell you that I can tell you that I could removed in China.
I thought I thought that I would be a current time from my family.
I never thought that it was 14 years together, it together.
In China was very hard to live as young girls without family.
I had no idea of how life was the life as a north Korean flyinger, but it would be extremely, but I'm not just extremely hardly, but also very hardly, but also very dangerously.
So I lived in strong standing that my reality could be involved in a bad, and you would be after northern Korea,
A day, one day, my greatest alptraum, when I was true from Chinese police and in the police of the police and in the police.
Somebody to be a north Koreanerina, so they were my chinese chinese chinese and I tell me about my chinese questions.
I had solided to me, I thought my heart.
If you can get somewhatural, I could be smart, I could be empower and abuse.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I felt my life, but I felt my feelings and I was able to control the questions.
After she was finished with the example, he said, "That was a false, "That was a false.
It's not North Korean."
And they love me. It was a wonderful.
Some North Koreaneran Bottian bottom of China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had great great happiness.
Even though they were taken, they were flying, they were free international pressure international pressure.
These northern Coreanerins didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, uncompecored in China, and after North Korea, where they're following their operties, effective or efforts or opened.
Even though I had been lucky, I had a lot of other north Koreanernorean.
It's tragic that North Koreaneryan their identity and hard to make survival.
And then they've learned a new language and worked in a moment in a moment on the head of the head.
After 10 years of the most past 10 years of the most past 10 years, and I've been able to go to South Korea.
Mich in South Korea, never been a bigger challenge, when I thought it was a greater.
English was in South Korea so important to learning my third language.
At the big difference between North and South Korea and South Korea.
We're all corean, but inside our innovation, we've been extraordinary,
If I was absolutely a identity.
Bin Is South or North Korean?
Where do I come? Who am I?
Audience, there was no lander, there were no landing.
Although I was the anpassion of the southern Corean life, I had a plan.
I'm going to be approached for the university.
And I was asked to my new life, I could have a shock, I could have a bad.
The north Korean body fingers, the money that I family, and when I was sended my family, and when I was a street, and when I was able to return on the country.
They had to fast as possible as possible, so I started her flying their flight.
North Koreaner, a uncredible streets on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible between North and South Korea and South Korea, Ironically, Ironically, I was after China and made me on the way to China and I was record.
Because my family no chinese language, I had to live in more than 2,000 miles, and then after South Adostasia.
The business is a week, and we've been remained more fast.
Once, when the bus once, a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the evidence of all, and he started questions.
And I didn't understood, I thought, I thought I thought they would be found.
When the Chinese practic reports of a family, I decided told him that they were taking themselves, and I said to her approach their attention.
He looked at me, but I think, I think, but happy, he was happy.
We've got to read it up to the laotic grands, but I had to break up the grandchildren to borders of laos.
But even after we had the bordership, my family inhaft, my family inhaft.
After I had gone money and should have been paid, my family inside a months in a months, but it was family in the main city of Laft, in the main city of Laos.
This was one of the greatest running my life.
I had all done to family to family to freedom, and we were so nearly danced, but my family was just family, just family.
I went back and I went through the awander of the police and the police, and trying to family, but I hadn't enough money, but I hadn't enough money or money to paybe the money.
I lost everything my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man, "What's los?"
I was fully about it, that a friends are careful.
In fact, in English and with a words, I recognize my situation and without a bank, and without a bankomat, and they were to getting the money and two other northern Korean, and two northern Korean.
I thank you very much about him from all the heart and asked me?"
"I don't help you," he was.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The revorite free-dime membolized for me to a new hope that the North Koreanerans, and he needed me to show me the friends and he told me the friends and the university of the brain, and the hope of the community as the core.
And finally, after our long risk, my family and I received to received freedom, but the freedom.
Many North Koreaner's done by their families and soon as they're in a new country, they're not going to be able to get a money or not a money.
The international community can help us help us to help us to help us to help us to recognition and many more.
We can also be the bridge between people in North Korea and the Aucorea and the Aucorea and many of us in contact with families, and we're sending them information and money information and money information.
I had a lucky, so much hope and inspiration inspiration inspiration in my life, I hope to successful northernational companies with international companies.
I'm sure you're going to see much more successful North Koreaner on the world, also see on the books of TED.
Thank you very much.
I just have a bit of a bit.
I don't say you're not that I'm normal.
I want to tell you my break.
Remi is 22, big and very well.
He can't talk to you, but he can't communicated freedom, like some of the best red of the best red.
Remi white is the love is.
He's particularly remaining and expensive it.
He's not just a real. He's not on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious difference and imagine you're just never religiously never telling you a light.
If he's going to try to be appears to words that I'm not even remember that I remember one thing: how important we know about the construction of how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He's a absolutely uncomfortable brain.
But he's also a soul.
He can't remember if he was my shocola, but he's remember the public public death of every songs on my iPod, he had been in my iPod, and he was four, as fourth, while he was fourth of my phone.
Don't it sure?
But many people don't stimulate.
And in fact, because their understand not in the society of normal pasters, they're often, they're often, and false.
But what my heart is my heart and my sea, and my sea, even though this was the case of the case wasn't aware of whether they were just appropriate that they couldn't have a couple of autistically -- extraordinary -- elier.
Now, for the you who are not so language with the path of you who are not so much more complex function, it's a complex function of the brain, the social communication, and sometimes the social communication, and sometimes.
It's approached in every individual, in fact, it's kind of like Sam.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person at autism, and even though it's one of the most fastest development of the world is not a fast engineering engineering or health or health or health or health or health.
And I can't remember the first time I remember, but I can't remember, but I can't remember it without a day.
I was just three years old, when my brother, when my brother, and I was so once I was so on my life.
And after a few months, he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play how it's the other babies, and actually not very interested in my babies.
Remian and regarded in his own world, with his own world, and he founds, and he founds like the little bit of the smallest thing in a small found in a series in a serious thing that what it's going to do with it.
And when he was a different, he was different, and the difference, and the difference.
But the wood and the wood and the frustrating and the frustrating hyperactivity was something really a very unique, a remarkable nature, a junny, a junny, a junk of the world, a human beings, who never been a human.
At the same thing.
Now, I can't live that there was some of the family moments in my family, moments, moments I wished to me that they would be exactly like I would be exactly like I would be exactly how I would be exactly like I would be.
But I'm going to go back to the thought that they've been taught me about individuality, communication and love that this is not understand that this thing I wouldn't want to be able to tell you that this is not going to be thousands of thousands.
Normality about the beauty of beauty that the beauty, and the fact that we are different, and the fact that we're different from us, that one of us is not that one of us.
It means that there's a different kind of responsibility.
And if I could just say a thing to say, and I could say to you, and then you wouldn't have to be normal.
You know, you know, you're going to be.
Because, autistic or not, the difference that we have -- we have a stories! Jeder's a strange of us. And in all the way, and in all the streets of potential opening open-pernocial open.
The chance on the size, finish and walls in the moment, in the moment, in the moment, like someone else.
By -- you don't say that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doco Edgron has a projection and neuriosity, with this photo on the photo on the projectility and with a projecture of just a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, and see the world, and see the world, but the world don't see a million or a million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion or a million or a million or a million billion
I'm going to tell you a new kind of photography, the Femto-Fotography, a new education, so fastics that they can make time in movement in movement in movement.
And so we can build cameras, we can build the absolutely to look at edits or without a room or without a beautiful body in our body, and really question, what we can do with "Camera."
If I'm going to take a laser, and I'm going to take a million skin, and it's more female -- that's more female -- that's a pethoton, I'm going to be a billion pethoton, and this is going to be a millimethod.
So if you take this project, this photones, and it's in these flashes and it's going to take these photones in the flashes in the flashes?
How does it look like this light?
So, this whole events --
So think about that, you think that all the events are actually less than a nanosecond, more than a nanosecond -- so light, and so light, but I'm lighting this video to the factor to see this video to the factor, you can see the light.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, in this moview, so you can do this, so let me show you what happens.
The puls, our project, our project, in the flashes with a photonespaket, which starts to move and the finally inside the same.
A part of the light, after the table, and you see this extreme of the waves.
Many of the photones are reaching the last few last, the rivers of the flashes and exploding.
As you can see, there's air, there's air, which is in the flash.
As after the waves are the waves on the table from the reflexion of the reflexion of the rivers of the flash of the flash of the flash of the flash.
If you take a south of project, and it's the same street and return the video, and the video to 10 billion dollars, you know how long you have to see how long you have to see the film?
All day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long moview -- from a long film -- from a long project.
And how does it look like a little bit of stillle-Fotography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like if you're a stein in a teacher.
I'm going to be as a photo mold the nature of nature, some picture, but of course, of course, but of course, of course, and of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you're going to recognize that if the lights, you're going to get this further. They're not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the tomate is reified to the light in her to place and after seconds and after seconds.
So, in future when these future camera in your camera in your camera, it might be able to be able to be able to make it in a surgery and figure out if you can see if you're going to be able to build a front of them.
So how did my team in MIT this camera?
So as a photograph, if you know, if you have a photographically, you have very important light, but we've been a billion light, but we're going to get a billion times as your citizens, so you know, so you don't get a light.
So we're doing this: We're going to make this project, this photones, and we're going to show you the very clever and recording to this gigabytronization and recognize this gigabytle, and we've been recognize these foss.
And we can take all these rows and we can do all these responsible things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can make us feeling us, but how would it be a new surgery for a new surgery: to see edits: to see eckness?
The idea is that we're going to street up the door.
It's going to go back to the room, a part of it, part of it's going to go back to the door and finally reflection, and we could use these more simplices of the lights of the light.
And that's not service. We've built it even fiction.
Link about our female camera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to let the light.
After our attention in the "Nature Communication" was published by nature, it was created by nature.communication.communication.
We're going to get this light, and they're going to get this wall and they're going to get this photones, and they're going to be able to record our pupped and some of the pupped pupped to read the light, and then the light.
And because we have a camera, the so fast -- our faster is our faster camera has some single camera.
She's a very good time, and she can look at the world in light.
And we know, of course, we know, of course, but also the most objects, but we don't know what we know, but we don't know what the point of decision.
Indeed a laser online, we can see a row, we can see a roh-bots -- how they can see them on the image -- not really sense of these images, but if we're going to try together and try together and try together and try together and try together and try together, and we'reate the
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a sense often, we can see the vision of the laboratory, we can build the cars, we can build the collisions that can be able to recognize what we can see in the course of the course of the course of lights.
But because of the blood and building is the natural, of course, that's why the really behavior, now that's a way to think about female female, a new female picture of the next memory of the next memory of memory.
So, as we can do this, and we can't have a scientists, and we can't have a scientists, a artist of the ultra-tra-potography, and I realized that all these gightens, and I'm not just such a matter of data.
But it's also happening here.
If you look at these waves under the flower of the waves, you see that the waves of us.
The waves should be moving to us.
What happens?
It turns out that we're almost in light, because we've been able to take away, and appears and astein, and a sense of this image.
The record, in the events in the world, in the world, he's going to happen in the camera in the camera in the camera, so you can relationships, so we can relationships, we can criminate these consumeration.
So we should be able to figure out the picture of a new picture of a new creative construction, or new drivers, or new drivers, and we all have data, we all have data and data, and we all of our data, and we've allowed to help.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of our opportunities, how our lives can improve our lives.
We don't make any news on the street, so many ways, so many ways, so many ways, but we use this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and creating things like a types and circuits and circuits and circuits.
The projects of my questions, how much might be like much might be as much might be my neighbor?
How can we listen to stop more things without us?
How can we remember our memory, and how do we're going to understand the country?
And how can we be able to read our houses, so that our general, so that our communities and trees our minds and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea, the huge each other, the hundreds of years, the hundred years, beds, bedrothers and trees, and trees of a city, I've been able to be a city, in the music.
I think every time, every time, anyone nobody never knows there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of most reason for most of the city.
If I could have this house, and I have a beautiful, how I could change it. Dabe I thought I thought that my life for always changed my life.
In 2009, I was a very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death, and it was suddenly and unexpected.
I thought about the death, and I was a big disease for my life, and I needed to be a big disease of my life that are important.
But it's hard to me, these sort of each days.
It's easy to lose and relate what really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the lucky, I want to be a box. I want to take a box." Just.
I wasn't sure what I could expect on the experiment, but I could get the next day, but the wall was the wall, and she was always trying to kep it.
I want to share some sentence with you, who were written by people who were written.
"Bevor I want to ster, I want to be pirather."
"Bevor I want to ster, I want to stand up international data."
"Bevor I want to send for millions of people."
"Bevor I want to ster, I want to plant."
"Bevor I want to live "netting "netting"
"Bevor I want to ster them, I want to go to my arms."
"Bevor I want to ster, I want someone who want to be someone."
"Bevor I want to be ster, I want to be myself."
This is after place, and it was a sense of sense of place, and the hope and trees of people who needed me to the laughters and translated me to the wine and during the hope.
It's about it is that you don't alone.
It's about our neighborhood and understanding on a new and on a new way and way.
It's about the place for best, and for remembers and remember what we're important, what's important, while we're going to change and change ourselves.
I did this last year, and I did this last year, and I've been able to make people who wanted to build a waller with their community and I wanted to build a colleagues and now, and now I've been able to make a basically in the world, like countries, like Africa, South Africa.
We've done how much power our public places, if we have the opportunity to expect our voice and more with other people with other people.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever, and the things that are important to think about the right bubble and think that life is the life that life is currently.
We're going to talk about the death, about death, or just to think about death or just thinking about it, but I realized that the idea that the idea of the death is the idea of the death is the most strong.
The idea of the death of death, the death of life.
Our collection, the planet, which is the best thing that we can be important than Individual and more important. And with more possibilities and stories can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to be approached mathematics. A particular problem for everyone who are considered mathematics, is that we're involved in companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I do.
Tances is one of the most human activities.
We're decided to be approached by most ballettle and switches, like you're going to see how you're going to see how you're going to see.
For Ballettle is a extraordinary massive massive and ability to create a capacity and possibility, and possible evention that could have a genetic common components.
Tractually, first, neurological strengths like Parkinson, this extraordinary capacity. That's what it makes her at my mind, and that's a ballettup of the time.
And you've been doing a lot of research in the mistake.
Trottime, there's a worldwide 63 million people who live in this crankity, and they have to be able to be able to be able to live with the symptoms, and other people who are living more living.
We need to be the researchers can be a projective message, and it's the only way to know if we can know if we have a couple of massive massive massive markets that question can be a question.
<unk>rigger is that there's a parkinson and other movement, so you can't simple biombs, so you can't simple best. That's what there's 20 minutes.
You have to be able to turn it into the clinics. It's very expensive, and that means that's not going to be a highly nobody.
But what if patients could make patients could make these tests?
That would be a big decided in Krankenhouse. What if patients could make these animals?
It wouldn't be a teacher's normal normal.
It costs <unk>100 percent of the neurological approaching in the neurological approach.
So I want to tell you a unconventional Method, with the method, because we're trying to reach the senses, because we're all in a virtuoid, virtual Jan Strian Strian.
Here you see a video of video of video.
And that's happened in the health country when somebody can received us as a stimular ballettle, because we can coord all these voices, because we have to coordinate the coordinate, and we all have to build the game.
And as Ballets it's enormous amount of evolution.
Think about how long a child, like long a child, until it.
And so we can see the position of the female stimmlipping stimming. And as the morganisms are also the voice of Parkinson.
And the instance of the example of an example of an example of voice for inequipping stimular stimular stimulation.
We're always seeing this symptoms.
Stimes, swaps, switch.
The language is so such age, and it's a example of example, and that's a example of that.
These effects in the voice, you can see the voice, but sometimes, sometimes, but with digital microphone and presence, combined with new line, combined with new line, with new line, with new line, we can do with new line.
How can you look at these tests with clean mes? Well, they're not both. The test tests.
You know, the infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly the victims are not going to be the voice of experts.
So you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be self-constantly.
They're very quickly, thought, three-fours.
They're very billig and we know what that means.
If you can do something extremely, you can also be in large massive.
And this is astonishing create with this.
We can reduce logistic swimilary patients.
Patients don't have to leaders in the clinics in the clinics.
We can remember if we can relationships.
We can recognize massive massive for clearly clean studies and explanation of the whole population of the whole population of the whole population.
We have the possibility to biombs for the biomarkers for the disease of the disease.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we started the parkinson's simmy.
With Aculab and patients Like Meeech, we'd like a very high number of stimular currently enough to be enough for the exciting of these collection.
We have rooms that divided to be a billion people on this planet on this planet.
Everyone, or without Parkinson, can be after a couple of parkins for a few center for a few center. I'll get that we're going to get a center of our goal process.
Thank you.
If you say, we say 10,000 people called 10,000 people, you can say, who's not going to say, who isn't it?
What are you going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients were during the patients, whether these person on Parkinsonid or not. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Some people are not going to make it to the end of the end.
But we're sammall data, under different data, under different environment, which is important. These are important, because we are important to figure out what are the same parkets of parkins are the real marker.
First of their 86 percent of their own policy?
It's much better.
My slightly Thanas -- I have to love him because he's so fantastic work -- now it's also fantastic works, it's also working about the mobile phone, which is what this projection is what this project.
That's what I call a conservation.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handy on the handy, and people can make people with Parkinson could make their voice, so that their voice, so that you can take their doctor of the crisisism.
Guy.
Thank you. Max Lake L L Lake, my damen.
Thank you.
Here I live in Kenya, I live in Kenyairobi-National Parks.
In the background, you see the cow of my vather and the coast of my vather is the Nairobi-National Park.
The Nairobi-National park is just in the south of the south. That means that words are like covers like cebrased the park every single time.
The rulets that the solution, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They kill our viety.
This is one of our cows that was after the morning. I thought it was bad. It was a big box. It was our only one bully.
My stamm that the stamm of the massai, we think we're collecting with our animals and the way we got together. That's why we're using our animals.
I learned to slightly, I'm going to eat.
Our war warrior Morans. They're going to be used our collection and our history. They're eventually, and they're going to be able to do this problem.
and kill the solution.
Here's one of six solution that were in Nairobiobi.
And I think there's a nairobi-bi-National parks.
In my stamm is a junny between six years, and next for the cowerful for the cower. So it was also.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire fire. Lions for fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to see the solve the cower.
But I didn't go on. I didn't do.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to try to a vogel.
I wanted to think that the solution I thought I was studying the cow.
But solutions are very clearly terrify.
They come up, the vogels and go back and go back. Because they come and say, they're going to move it, and they're still not, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And they're going to go and kill our vieties.
One night, I went to the stall. I love the case in the hand to him and this time to make the lions and that's not at the solution.
Like for light, the light, that's moving.
I had a idea.
I was a little junch of working on my room, I was a day in my room and number of my mother, and I took the new roadio my mother. Anyway, but I had to be a lot about electronics.
I took a old carsy and a robotorrad a motorrad. The motorrad. The left or left. He wants to be able to blind.
And I was a shalter, I was a shalter to a box and expression.
This is a little birth of a capture of a capture.
And then I built all of them.
The solar panels are the battery who love the battery, the battery. I call it a transformator. I call it a transformator.
And the range of the research.
You can see that the birth to the birth, because of the solve the solution.
And so it looks like this, if they come from the solve.
The light blink and the light and the solution I think I was about the stall. Thabe I was the whole time in the bed.
Thank you.
I have this installed installed and since we didn't have a problems with solve more with solve.
And then our neighborhood.
One of them was this grandmother.
They had a lot of their animals and they asked me if I asked her lights installed my favorite.
And I said, "Yes."
If I could see the light. They can see the solution in the background.
And so I've been able to surround them in the neighborhood and they really work.
My idea is going to be able to use cenyces, also for other robots like Hya, or Leoparden. The lights. The lights.
My experience to me to a stip with a stip with a stip with a best school in Kenya, Brookhouse in Cense, and I'm really excited.
My new schools are engaged and helps themselves and holding through springing.
I've even my friends with home and I've been brought together, and I'm not going to use the lights there, and I'm not going to use them.
A year ago, I just a junk of Savanne, who was sitting his vaters. I saw myself, and I saw myself, "I'm going to sitting in a sit."
And here I'm going to do.
I thought about a plane, I was involved for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a big, I want to be airplane and pilot. That's my great dream.
From I've been going to go through my experience, but through my vather, I can talk to my vather and the solution, and we can return the solve, and we can live without side, without the solution, without street.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I'm going to tell you very much.
You know, you know, you don't know how to hear it's a story like your history.
So you're going to have this stip. Yes. Yes.
You work on other electrical experiences.
What's the next on the list?
My next experience, I worked on a real electrical functric functrocauna. Onectroza?
Yes, I know, electric found, but I want to read my own, but I want to have my own own.
You've almost it's trying to try and I'm trying to get you to try and trying to get the trying to get the trying to get a shock.
All of approach. Richard Turere, you're a little bit more bonderful.
We're going to be drawing your way to refer to my friends.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm a quite old enough, a camera in the hand, is Fotography, but I want to share with you 15 years, but I want to share 15, and no one of my favorite, and no idea of it.
There was no kind of Director, no style, no chance to be a picture of a picture. Not even the relationship.
And to be able to be covered by most of the most various tourists of tourists.
My story begins when I was a talking about a talk in New York was this picture, and my wife, I was on my first birthday on my poor. We were on my arm. We were on my arm.
And we were a year later, we were recovered in New York and so we decided to look at the same picture.
Well, you can see that, you can see the out.
When the third building my daughter, my wife said, "Hey, why, why don't you get to New York and do it a father and do it a father or a father?"
And so we started to make tourists of tourists, a picture of us.
You know, it's notice, how universal, like universal face is when you're going to be a free-dig freedom.
Nobody has never said, no one, and fortunately, no oneone with our camera.
And so we knew how much these receives our lives.
This recently is very hard to be very hard.
This is just after the 11th, after the 11. September, and I had to understand what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old.
These images are much more than just a fear-old moment, or a particular moment, or a certain risk.
They're also a possibility for a week in the october, and how we change our time and how we change our time and how we change our time, but not just physical, but in all the way.
Because if we do that, we're always make our perspective of males. While they always reaching new miles, and as they're always seeing their eyes with their eyes, and how they see it's about it.
These very intensive time we spend with each other, and every year we've been doing something that we've been expecting every year.
Last, while approached away, we went to place and place them as they're going to be suddenly as they're going to show them how they're going to show you a pupples in a pupples, as a little kids, as a little kids.
And she telled me about their feelings that they had been as a five-year-old grandmother.
She said they remember how their hearts to the heart of the brust, when she saw the first time, the first time, the first time,
And now she looked in New York, because they want to study, because they want to study in New York.
And I realized, I realized: The most important thing we all allowed to create.
And so I want to share with you the idea of the idea of expensive role in the most experience of experience.
I don't know how it looks like this, but it's above from this 15 images, I'm on a family.
I'm always the image.
I want to tell you about today today with you today with you and you don't want to ask you, "Would youn't you want to make a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
