When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the closed of the guy.
My father heards his little gray, gray, gray, the news, the news.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual, because the next thing that was really unusual, because the news.
He called "The Taliban are female."
I didn't know what that meant, but it was really happy, but it made me very happy.
"You can you go to a real school," he said," he said.
And I'm not going to forget.
A rather than a real school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I spent it to school, and they spent the girls.
And so I realized myself, I five years, and I started my older sister, and I started my sister, who don't get anymore, to a secretching.
And just so we could go to school both to school.
Every day, we couldn't take a different way to get a different way to get a different way.
We hidden our books in the books in the books, so we would just look like this.
And we were in a house, we were over 100 girls in a small women.
And in the winter was incredibly hot, but incredibly hot.
We all know that we all know that we all know that teachers, teachers, teachers and our parents.
And then, again, the unlessly, suddenly for a week, because the Taliban convention.
We never had never been sure how much they knew about us.
Do they followed us?
Did they know where we know where we live?
We had afraid of the still, but we wanted to school.
I had a big deeply lucky to growing as important as important as importantly, and daughters.
My grandfather was his time.
And one outside of a decided province Afghanistan. He was sending his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- to send his father.
My filmed mother, but teacher, teacher.
That's what they do.
Two years ago, she went to the rest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhoods.
And my father -- this was the first one of his family, who ever had a school boy,
For him, it was clear that his kids would be a children would be a children, even though, despite the Taliban, despite of all the risks of all the risks.
He looked like a much larger risk of his kids, his kids don't send to school.
I know exactly that I was in the Taliban, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, from our lives, from our lives, and the perspective and the perspective lossibility,
I was like to give you to give up. But my father said, "Taughter, you can hear me. You can lose your life.
Your money can be done. You can be done in war in war in war.
But one thing is, you're always getting here. And even if we have to stay with our blood for your blood for your blood for your blood for your stuff.
So -- you still want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, which is destroyed by decades.
Less than 6 percent of my age of my age, age of my age, age, and when my family, and if my family, and if my family to my school, I would have one of these women.
Instead, I stand up here today, as a proud of the middlebury College.
When I got back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was my grandfather who was taken by his family, because he was to send his daughter, one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one
He doesn't just like my high schoolabs, but also I was also the first woman, and I was the first woman who was the first woman who was driving him.
My family believed me.
I have a big dreams, but my family has greater trees for me.
And so I'm global messages for 10x10, a global campaign for 10x10,
And so I've helped to green, SOLA, and maybe the first and maybe a single Internative girl in Afghanistan, a country where the girls.
It's wonderful to see how the schools of my school with great early honor to all of them, all of them.
And to see how their parents and fathers and fathers, as well, as my parents for me, and despite all the time, and despite all the time.
So as Ahmed. That's not his face, and I can't show his face is not the father is the father of my student.
And a month ago, his daughter and he's surface, and they're the village, and they're just took a bombs in the streets.
When he got home, he came home, and he sounds and a voice threatened him, if he was going to send his daughter, they would try to send it.
And he said, "The killing me, if you want to get me, but I'm not going to sit down the future of my daughters to play, because of my olderly and more old ideas."
What Afghanistan, I realized something like this, I realized something that's going to be able to be able to be the most of us who have the success, the most success, the value of his daughters, and the value of his success.
That's not succeed that our mothers don't playing in our success.
And they're very highly the ones that are convinced and convinced for a much convinced future of their daughters. But in a society like the in Afghanistan is the men's the men.
And the Taliban was just a few hundred girls -- because it was some hundred girls -- because it was ever illegal.
But today, but in Afghanistan over three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America,
The Americans are recognize how we are solutions.
I don't think that change is not by Dauer and they're not changes, and they changed everything.
But if I look at Afghanistan, when I see the school, when I see the school, and their parents that they can use their parents that they encouraging them to do a much long-long future and a lot of future and a long-long wall.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unless and the unless we remember, and I remember every day, and I remember the girls.
And that's what I have a big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, even calculated -- my life -- my life -- my life was seven years of work in Africa as young man.
In 1971 to 1971 to 1971 to 1971, but I've been -- I've been working in Sambia, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria, algeria, algeria, and Somalia, and we work with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project that we were able to put on the legs that we finally records.
I was a movement.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're just good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we killed everything we've been starting to do.
Our first project, which is what my first book, "Ripples to the Zambezi" inspiring, was one that we wanted to show the people that we wanted to show the people, like Noodia.
We came together with a couple of South Asia; we were in South Asia; we leadsi-Flussi-Flussi-foothimic population, and we learning the tomata and Zucini and Zucini and Zucini.
Of course, the answer to the an interest in it, so we didn't pay for the work, and sometimes they didn't pay for the work.
We were just amazing that there was no landwide in a country,
But instead of catching why they didn't say anything, we just said, "God, thank you, thank you."
"Gerade, right now to save the people to save the people who save the people who save the collection."
Of course, all of you know, everything in Africa.
We had these practically tomata. In Italy, they were so big, they were so big.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Look, "Look, how economy."
When the tomata, and red, and they came acrossss the nights of the river, and they asked everything.
We said to the Sambian: "Oh God, the Nilputer."
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have a country."
"Why didn't you say, "I don't say, "You've never asked us."
I just thought we were so great, well, but then I saw in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, which made the Englands, which was what the Frenched. After I saw what they did.
We felt the narrowing the nutrients.
They should see the uncomfortable -- you should see the uncertainly nothing to see the United African people.
They should read Aid" by Dambisa Moyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyo, it's a sambic economist.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have given the African continent 1.5 trillion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money.
Let me just her book.
Lady from an Africans, which we've been involved.
We western people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, and there are only two species, and we're patriarchalic.
Both words from the latines from the latines," which means "Father" means "Father"
But they have two different meaning meanings.
Patriarch: I'm treated everyone each of another culture, they would love you my children. "I love you."
Patronizing: I'm treated everyone each of another culture, they were my service.
And so people are called people in Africa, Chef, Chef, Chef,
I was growing up when I was the book, "Small," by small," by small, he said, "Small, especially, if people don't want to help people don't want to let them in Rwhead.
This is the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is respect.
Today, the morning, who was opened this conference that conference, and asked a staborates, "Can you imagine a city?"
When I was a 27 years old, I decided to people, and he found a system called a system called companies, where no one initiating, no one has ever been initiately ever been initially, but you will ever be the services of the services of the services of the services of the serv
What you do -- you do is -- you're going to do.
You never get a community with ideas with ideas, you're settled with the series of the series.
We don't work from office.
We're going to meet in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Cneips.
We don't have an infrastructure.
We finally flew friends and find out what the person.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can someone can give you an idea.
If these person doesn't like this?
The passion for the passenger growth of person is the most important.
The passion for the passenger growth is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge because no one can be successful, because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea hasn't the idea, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, why did I get this instead of saying, instead of saying, and people say, what they should do, why don't we hear about why don't we? But not in community.
Let me give you a secrets.
There's a problem with community.
And entrepreneurs have never been shared, and they will never say what they want to say about what they want to see with their money to see.
Planocked this blind flews.
The most smart people of the community, you don't know, because they never seem to be able to public trees.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, to be a social infrastructure that don't exists.
A new created a new job.
This is the house, the house, the house, the house, who's house, who's in your house, and in your box, and in the caf" and find your passion in a way that you're going to transform your passion in a way that life.
I've got this in food, West Australia, tried to try and tried to do this.
I promovated to the time and tried to get the time and trying to get to do what they should say, what they should do.
And so I went to help the first year, and I had the first three days, and I had three days. I'd be able to get him. He was him. He was him. I was half. I was half. I'm going to sell him, and I sell himself and doing it.
I think that's help these fish, and I'm not going to help me to help meeting a factory in Albany for 60 cents, but after Japan for 15 dollars for 15 dollars for 15 dollars." And then, "Huy. And then, and they said, "Huy.
In a year, I had 27 per year. The government, and the government, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I hold the mouth and hold it."
So -- so -- so, the government: "Make it again."
We've done it in 300 communities.
We've been helping companies in the business.
There's a new generation of companies that are a new generation of companies.
Peter printer, one of the best companies of the best companies, a few years ago.
Peter printer printer was Philosophypected with companies before he said, "Peter printer said, planeter printer said, planeter, and the business and the economy and the economy and the economy and the economy."
Planocus is the death of the entrepreneurs.
So you built a collection without knowing what the closest human Christching without their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this.
You have to give them discretion and privacy and privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them getting hard to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
What do you have the presentation, you have the most applauday?
<unk>riven, suffering people. They have applauded.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- well, we're fuels, fuels, fuels, and suddenly systems that are not sustainable.
The connectional powerful.
The friends of the institution is not sustainable.
We have to look at them, we need to look at seven billion people on the seven billion people, cure, cure, cure, transporting and transportation and with them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who is this technology for the green revolution? Universities? Universities?
The government? Do you.
It's going to be entrepreneurs now.
I read a food story in a fooduristic magazine magazine.
There was a group of experts that were in the future of Experts town town town town town in the city of New York.
In 1860, they came together, and they were in 100 years with the city of New York, and the city of New York, the city was a unity, the city of New York.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population in this tempo further, they needed to be six million pathways needed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be finished by six millions of six millions of paths
Because they went down in the master.
In 1860, they see the hard technology that's life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001 cars in the United States -- 1001.
The idea, another technology, and the running, and there was tiny little bit of little factory in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secrets to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing that's got to be distression.
Otherwise, they don't talk to you.
And the next thing you have to take them off, you have to engaged and economic service.
And then you have to give them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the smallest company to be able to be able to sell you, three things: The three things: That's to be selling product.
Do you know?
We never met a single person who can simultaneously, and selling something that can sell the money, and to sell the money.
That's not exist.
This person was born.
We've looked at research and we looked at the world, and we looked at the world -- Carnegy, Westinghouse, Westinghouse, Ford the new companies, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Google, Google, G
There's just one thing that allows you all have successful companies have been a common, just one: No, just one person.
Now, we're going to teach 16-year-olds in Northum and we start to start the businesses, and we start to give them the first two sides of Richard Branson Autobiography of the first two side of the first two side of the first two side of the first two side of the first two side of the first
Nobal "I" and 32 times "wir" and 32 times.
He wasn't alone, he started.
Nobody green a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So we can do a community, in the community, who have a little bit of the entrepreneurs, in Caf<unk>s and bars and bars and bars and bars, and they're going to do what you do for this gentleman, which is that you're talking about this eposed about this eposed about this eposed
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you sell it? Can you sell up the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Make you." "Make you mean, I think someone for you?"
We're activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who can be support the companies, and they're going to help them to help them to help them to help them out of the middle of the intelligence of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economy and the economy and the economy and the economy
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be, how it must be a wonderland, Alice in the wonderland.
The Penn State University, a Doccentin for communication -- a communications -- to engineering in communications.
I was afraid.
They're afraid of these students with their great brains and their big brains and their books and their books, and their books, and their books.
But as the conversation, as the conversation, it was like Alice, as Alice, as Alice, and she looked down to a whole new world, and a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I felt as I was conversation with the students. I was amazing about the thoughts that they had thought that they had another one of these wonderlands.
I think that door to open up these door, it's great communications.
We need to have increasingly great communications of our scientists and engineering the world.
Because our scientists and engineers, the ones that are the largest problems, like energy, energy, environment, and if we don't understanding, and if we don't know it's nothing about it. I think it's nothing in our necessary as a science.
But these great conversation is not to get to understood when our scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers.
So scientists and engineers, please, please.
I want to show you a few an approaches, how to see it that we can see that we can see that the science and technology and technology and technology and technology and spaneous.
The first question that you have to answer is, is, is, and?
Say, why don't just relevant scientific areas of scientific areas.
Say not just that their dragoning, but they also tell us that their dragon, but also tells us that their dragon that you can understanding in our bone, because they're important to understand oast, because they can understand and understanding ooporose.
And when you do that, what you do, what you do, then you're avoidet.
After all, a hinders are a hands of your minds.
Surely, you could use it belief and quite, and why don't you just say, but why don't just say, "Ra and time," what's a lot of us?
Our idea of doing this, is not to make the same as their name as their nive right now.
As an instein said, "Make things like, "Make things like this, but not just as possible -- but not easier."
You can tell us something about yourself, something about your scientific area of scientific areas, without having to go to the compromise.
A few things are involved in the couple of things: For examples, stories. Asia. As you can take this way.
And if you're going to do your work, then you read the stories, then the stories.
Did you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stichpoint."
What happens when someone else? Are you going to do is another one, and with these points, and with these points.
A slide is not just slowly slowly, but also slowly, but also in the language of our brain, and we're going to be able to do it.
This example, for example of genes from Genevieve Brown is much we're showing that the special structure of the traffic stability is that they even the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration for the effective design of the effect.
The trick here is to use a single simple, just to use the sentence, which is the audience, if it can be used to read the fact that can be used to be able to use our other sense of our other sense of the other sense of a deeply a deeply a deeply a deeply a deep
These are just a few ants that can help us to see these door, and the door and the wonderlands and the technology and technology and technology and technology.
And so the engineers I've been teaching me, I've been taught me to make me to make me to make me to make anything with a similar together with a same with a same with a similar together.
And as you go through your science, and your stories and your stories, and your fields, so that's the relevance, so the audience, and so multiplicated, and multiplicated with the possible working with the unbelievable working on it. And he's incredible working on it ter. And
So scientists and engineers, if you've got this equation, you know, I realized me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a cell phone can break a cell phone in Syria.
With a handy can tweet a message, and you can start a protesta.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, it's highly high-cloud and they're going to be famous.
All of that is possible.
I'm a year 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people for changes on the streets and the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989, and we're in 1989, all these people who had been representing and changes, a handy in the cell phone.
Who has a handy handy?
Have you hold it up.
Have your hands, you're high.
Have you up. One android, a bubblackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my cell phone today, and my life, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 cells.
Rohdata.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006,
This direction is called Rightlinia is called the fact that recording.
This direction is that every phone is that every phone is that every phone in Europe, every Internetdle in Europe, a bandwidth in the entire europe, a bandwidth.
Who's going to sent? Who sent to a couple?
Who sent means a text?
And if you use a cell phone where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years of your phone, or your telephone or your Internetanbield or your Internetanbiety or your Internet.
And everywhere in Europe, people are the people, and we didn't want to say, "That's not going to be."
They said, we wanted to say that involved insurance.
We want to be self-bestime might not want to be able to do that, and we don't want the telephone and Internetdlephone, all of these information about us.
There was an advice, Journalists, Priester, "Thatis, we don't want to say, "That's not going to be."
And here you can see how 10,000 people on the streets of people on the streets and said, "Free fears and said, "Free."
And some people said, "They, this could be the stasi 2.0.
The stasi was the secrets of the surprising country.
And I asked me, if that really works.
Can you really know all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone called my phone, the Germany, the greatest telecom, the largest telephone, and I asked her, and I asked her, and I asked me all the information that you've been talking about me.
And I asked her and asked her and asked them and I didn't get a real big answer.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is protocols.
So I decided to do a course, a course, they wanted to have this information because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said, no, no, we're going to give you this information.
And at the end of it came to a compared to them.
I'll just pull back where they send me all of me, they all send me.
Because in the twice of the bunded connection of the emotion of the E.U.
So I got this hold this highly brown environmental brown.
And on the CD: That's the CD.
Thirty-foots information.
First, I saw it, and I told me, it's a huge data. Myetweetwegth.
But then I realized after a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this datei.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what I want to start with it?
Because you see where I'm where I'm sleep, which I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public information.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people what I want to show you what it means.
So with time, with time, and open data City, so I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can remember, you can record and you can predict and back and back and back.
You can do every step, you can do any step.
And you can see how I can see how I can see from Frankfurts with the tankfurts, and how many ancestors.
All of that information is possible.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just like this, and I called me and she calls me, and we're talking to each other.
And then I call a few friends and they call a few friends.
And after a while you call it and you call it and you call this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate people with each other, they can go to bed them to bed, when they go to Bed them.
You can see everything.
You know, you know, the central figures, about who are the leaders are the leaders.
If you have access to these information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect defect definition, how to make a society, because you know who's white, who's a little bit about who has a possible when you have access to these information.
And these information are going to be at least 6 months, in Europe, in Europe.
As I said to the beginning, we asked us to think that all these people in the streets in 1989 Herlins in 1989 hands.
And the stasize of who had been to be who had been in the demonstration of that, and if the stasi, and if the stasize who's going to be the leaders, maybe that's never happened.
The case of the mountains maybe not be founder may not be found.
And also, not the case of the ice case of the ice.
Because today, because of course, and companies and companies, how they can get to know how they can get about us, and of the pline.
They want to have the opportunity to remove our lives, and they want to remain all of them.
But even though, and a life in the digital time, and age of time,
But you have to be able to fight for the self-based.
They have to do it for every day.
So if you go home, you say, you're friends that Privacy of the 21st century, and that's not old-century.
If you go home, you say, you're going to have a business, because companies and state the possibility, they don't have to store, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you're asking your phone calls that information they've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you use your handy, you remember the self-bably, you need to be able to fight.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoes, snaurants, brestaurants, brought.
So the city planner, and so they're survive, and the Name South Central South Central to changed it to changed it into South Los Angeles, which is something in South Los Angeles, which is going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituosens, snows, snows, brestaurants.
So as 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the foods-west south Central Los Angeles, the home of the drive-bys.
The comic is that the drives are killing more people killed more people killing more people.
People die in South Central Los Angeles,
The fatty is in my fourths in my fourths, five times higher than about 15 miles, which is about 15 miles in Beverly Hills.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how you would have a healthy when you didn't have access to healthy food when you see every time you see every time you see, if you see the negative effects that are negative effects that are the best effects on your fourth system.
I'm going to sell that role and selling and selling and selling as building.
I see the dialysiscent lineary sugars like starbucks.
And I realized that this is that this is to stop.
I caped that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And then I had no light, I had no light, I had no light minutes, to get apple to get apple, who is not with pesticides in the present.
So I plant a food-worest forest.
It's a piece of Land, we call Parkanles.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is the thing is, it's the city.
But you have to flew it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility and I have to stand up in Stand."
And I decided to keping it into stands.
So I came up and my group, and my groups, and we started together, and we started to plants, and we started to plants, and own, so that's the whole program, so the whole program, so the whole program, so that's all program.
We're a kind of a sort of prediction, we're summary city, and all the city, and from all the city, it's completely free, and it's free, and everything we do, and everything we do.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone who was a little bit.
The city came to me and he came to me and he said, I had told me that I had to say that I have to have to be a garden to a rich slading.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A richter remembers of foods of food, because of food, which is a piece of land that's going totally dead?"
And I thought, "Cool. Hero."
Because this time, it wouldn't go on.
The L.A. Times, and I got a story of it. Steve Lopez and talked about it, and I talked to the city of Green Green Green Green Green Green Petition on Change.org and with 900 difference.
We thought you could have the hands.
My city rather than they're actually support it, and she said they're doing what we do.
So why would they do that?
L.A.A. has the United States, most brought most brought in the city.
They have 67 miles 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
That's enough flying around 725 million tomata points.
Why didn't find it?
And by the terms of a plants, you get 1,000 samples.
With green boh in the value of a dollars, you're going to be own value of 75 dollars.
It's my healing, I say, I say they should be able to build their own food.
His own food is to building is like your own money.
Look, I have a considered a south Central.
I grew up there. I grew up there.
And I remember, part of this, part of this reality, and I reality that was made by other people who were fabricians, and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Gardence is my graffiti. I plant. I plant.
And just like a graffiti coast artist who are beautiful, I think, beautiful, I'm a parkanels and Parkanlagen.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the trees and the trees and the trees for these stuff.
They would be surprised, what the Earth bottom, if you use it as a line.
You can't imagine how to imagine a sunflowerful, and how they're touching people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden to a single instrument for the responsibility of my fourths.
To change the community to change the collaborating the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wondering how kids are being affect.
Garden is the therapistic and careful and careful act, especially with the city.
And then you get to get earthquake.
I remember this time, when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30. They were in my garden, and I came out of my garden, and I came out.
I've been badly bad, because they were bad because they were there, and I said, "Wis don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been looking at me, when I saw people who were so close to do this, and that's just asked me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you don't get you to be fear."
And I said, "There, no, no, no, I don't have any fear.
And that's because it's the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it back, but I want to take it back to their health, they're going back to their health."
And I went to a different time, I set up a garden in this surface in Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Downtown LA.
These are the guys who have helped me to read the laster.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how they had affecting them and how they've been fled and her mother and her mother, and it was great, and it was great, and it was a great for a moment.
Green grounds like 20 garden has been plants.
And we came up with our environments, and they did so 50 people and they're all free willing to do.
If you children, it's eating children.
If they smelling tomata, they eat.
But if they don't get anything about it, if they don't get done, how food and body, how food they eat, they're blind, it's always eating them.
I see young people who want to work, but they want to stick up in this thing -- I see -- I see, I see, I see, which is the exactly on the path that's exactly on the path that leads.
The gardenly, I see when we trained as a children, where we can train to care about their communities to care about after life to lead after life.
And if we do that, who knows who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carvern Carvernment.
But if we don't change the collection of the Earth, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's one of my plans.
I want to plant a whole hits of garden, where people can share the same blocks in the same blocks.
I want to take shipscontainer and they turn into healthy Caf<unk>s.
So, don't understand me.
I'm not talking about costs, because costs, because costs is not sustainable.
The comicated to the sustainability is that you have to do it.
I'm talking about people, people who are going to give people from the streets of the streets, and they're going to leave the early and the early when you built his own food, and if you open your own farmers.
So what I want to do is to do is to do is to do.
I want to say that we all want to be ecological rebelling, Gangster, Garden.
We have to turn the screen.
If you don't have a gangster.
Are you going to be with 'It's going to be clear?
And let's take the weapons the weapon.
If you want to meet with meeting, you don't want to make meeting in a meting caves and make a meeting and make a meeting, where you're talking about it.
If you want to meet meet you want to get your sky, you can get to my garden, so we can sort of plants.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite sings in the entire Oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No university means "No,"
While, even though, a century, a better definition, "It's a better definition, "It's a greater, who is a remained by Partei, program or a long-time, program or a long-time mineer.
I don't know what "speakeral" is.
Somehow, I think, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians that they're trying to control the language.
For example, for example, for example, the British Parliament, the British Parliament, the debate.
And the thing that was actually back to the mother's courageously a man with the extraordinary name Brass Crosby, who was crosby,
She was him in the Tower of London and he was a muty enough, but he was mutigh enough to be enough to be enough, and he was so much until he was so much until he was so much until he was so much until the London.
And just a few years later, we find the first next message, we find the sentence of the Sentence of brass."
Brasses on the English word for bad for bad.
But that's not true. It's not true. It's a pressful of press.
But to show you how words and politics and politics, I want to take you to the United States, I'm going to take the independence,
You saw the question about how to call George Washington, the state of Washington, which is called State.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leaders of a republican nation?
And that's been infinite longress infinite longress.
And there were all sorts of all sorts of possible proposition.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernur Washington, and others, and others, and others, and others, and other, and other, the United States of America Washington.
Not as a compres from this.
Some people wanted to call him simply nice.
They thought that was since.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the kingdom.
It would have worked.
But everybody was uncomfortable, because these debate because these debate, because these debate.
I read the days of a senators, who's always writing, "Immmmers,"
The reason for the reason for the long time, and the long time, the representation was the senating.
The representation didn't want to do that what Washington, what's going to do. They didn't want to do.
Caniguously, and they're still going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
They wanted to him the most extremely, you know, the most personal title, who give them a little bit of them.
This guy was "President."
President. They didn't existed the titledge. But he was existed. But he was sitting a voice that someone of a vamine.
This is the same thing about a jury.
He didn't have anymore, when the recording "Apartment or "Apet."
Sometimes, there were practices, and there were small colonial communities, but it was really an unbed, but it was really an unbed title.
And so the senate of the senate.
They said, "That's smile, you can't call it President.
This guy has to write appears and writing and make sure and make citizens.
Who will take it, if he's going to take a thumbs like President of the United States of the United States of America?"
And also after three weeks of the senate of senate.
Instead of course, you know, the title, and the title, but they didn't want to use the colutely, but they didn't want to be absolutely civices, because of their opinion and methods and methods and methods and methods.
You can learn from three interesting things.
First, and I find that, I find out -- I don't find out if the senating whether the senating for the titled the titledge.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just got the title. He was just going to be the senate that the senate.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something that's something that's -- then you were too, you can also temporary.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, the Title "President of the United States of America," is not so sounds like this.
This has more than 5,000 nuclearly, and it's got to do that he's got the biggest volcancy of the world and a photte drone and a photte drone.
And what we've given the title.
And so the senating on the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the senating.
They have a respectables title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of embrace -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
Fortune 147.
Because they all want to sound like the candlearly, like the 5,000 nuclearly, and so on.
So the end of the senating and the representative representation because no one who feels like you're going to be a head, if you're going to be the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with what I'm going to do with.
Politicians to use words to use the reality to control the reality and the reality, but actually changes, but actually changes the reality of words, the reality of reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster of about 50 rebelling a campairs to campair -- a 19-year-year-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I thousands of my black crosssships, a pair of a pairs and celebrator and celebration panzer, I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
And I was long time, I was big, and I was big, and I was slowly new pyjama projama projama and football plays and fighting and fighting and rassistic southern Cindriminalistic southern Commonstrations,
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to show you here, I'm southeist, Southeists, Southeist, and atheist, and atheist, and atheistan and atheistan, who's been working in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do is to make art, but I couldn't make a personalize the personality, I don't like to make the personality and carriers and authority and car and car and car and released and records and records and reported ints and recire
I want to spend a day in life of a Derminister who's bringing his decision of communists like "Popstar Bling" and popstary broadcasting and political corruption and political corruption and political corruption.
And what else can do is doing the Derminister, as a parliament, and a choice and a choice and a choice and I'm doing with the slogan: "Whad and I'm doing."
And try to use these campaign to use these maybe to use these maybe as a national highly nationalhels.
I want to start the corruption in Afghanistan, and they're going to take a project called "Rid of the crashed on the cars," and they're going to be a wrong control streets and cabular cabular cars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistanistan, I wanistan conflict," is after the "modic conflict.
The war and the war and the foreign approaches that came to him, and they created a new environment for style and models and models that you can only collection for soldiers and self-moor.
And I'd like to see how a simple shoots, and I think that's cabular cabular creating appelling a dialogue today, and that's creating a dialogue today, and they're going to colonial Rhetics.
But for all of these things, you can get in prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be missing, missing.
But I do, because I have to do because I have to be because the geography of self.
That's my face. What's your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I've been working as a model.
Since 10 years, right, right now.
I feel like, I have a sense of space is an unfair, because I had no idea of this clothes, because I wouldn't have to stop.
Fortunately, I've got something to the way.
This is the first time that someone on the TED stage on the TED stage, so you can protect them, so I think you can be happy.
If you were really a few women were really explored when I got to say, I don't need to say that now, I don't reading to twitter.
I also realized that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds, which you think about 10 seconds.
And that's not to have the chance.
This is very uncomfortable, it's very uncomfortable, it's not sad.
The most difficult thing is, the pullover the pullovering my head, because then you're all going to do anything, so you're nothing about my head.
In order to be in order to be in order to be in order to do.
Why did I do that now?
That was possible.
Now, it wasn't hopefully as this picture.
One image is powerful, but a surface, but it's also a surface.
I just got to changing your opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this image -- I never really had never been a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photograph told me, and I told me, and I would be able to fit in the hand in the hand in the guy.
And then, from Operations or the wrong bridge I was a little brunch of two days ago, there are just very few few possibilities, and we have a few opportunities, and our quality -- although it's operating and unless and unless, and it's our lives ones.
To being awful to be honestly today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I stand up on this stage because I'm a hut, because I know a woman, and I know that I'm a sexy My Mal girls.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asking me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I realized," but that means nothing.
The real reason I was a mathematic light, is a mattery and a mattery and maybe you're asking you may be a best exactly what this is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we didn't just as healthy and young and young and young and symmmmetrically programmed, but also as biologically programmin and highly.
This is a created for me. And it's a result, and it's a number of me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audienceptic. And maybe some models like, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Small. Liu Walls."
And first of all, I'm going to comments, and I'm affective.
But I have to share with you, I have to share with you 2007, a very experienced Doctorand of the NYU all the mathematically, every single mold, and that was booking, and that was booking money, and that only 27 or not only four percent.
The next question that will always said, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm a model, "Can I'm a moment?"
And first of all, I said, "I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what I'm not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to girls really girls really girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be done.
You can be presidentin of the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a nineja-Herzchirurg-drives, because then you would be dead, because then you would be the first thing."
If they still think about this great tells you, no, no, no, I want to be a model," I want to say, "Who."
Because I don't have anything, and you couldn't be able to be the Chefredaces or the business leaders or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next steven master.
And you say that you're going to be a model is, you'd like to say that sometimes you want to win the Jackpotto.
You can't be able to find it, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years, I want to tell you about the idea of the constrate, because it can be surgeon, it can be just a surgeon.
And if you go back to the photographics, and you can see, and you can see, and you know, "Cameron, and the cameron, we want to go to the cameron," and then you go to the legs," and then the legs, and then the legs, this arm, this arm, this arm, this arm, and that's going
It looks like this.
Hopefully than that in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle.
That was .... I don't know what's happening.
If you're slightly, and you've done a few jobs, you can't say, you can't say that you can say that you can say that you want to be presidentin of the United States, but in the lifestyle, you're going to see the world, you're going to seeing communic.
The next question that's often being, "Who's all the photos.
And yes, so pretty much all the photos are just a little bit of the story, but that's just a little bit of the story.
This is the most picture I didn't do that, and that was also the most else was also the first time I was a bikiniode. I hadn't even my periode.
I know that's pretty personally personal, but I was a young girls.
And so I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm on the day.
My friend had to start with me.
This is a pyjama projama projama Pyjama Pyjama providing for the French vogue.
This is me with the football team and in the V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you see that these images are not a pictures of me.
It's artificial constructs of a group of profession, from Have, from Have and Make-up coasts and photographs and photographs and stylistants and the production.
Okay, askay, people are always asking me, "Can you want to do things?"
Yeah, I've never meters that I can never met, which I never met, but the things I'm going to get the things I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went to a day, and I went into a single day, and you gave me the clothes.
And as a teenager, I went to my friend with my friend, and they were a red line, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and it just one: "If you could just kep on," and we could go on.
I've got this cost of my exception of my personality and not because of my personality and there are people who are because of their personality and not because of their personality and not personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were filmed in the last decades, and we were 85 percent Swars and Latinos and Latinos and Latinos and Latinos and Latinos and Latinos and Latinos and Latinos and Latinos.
It's live in New York, 17,000 young, men and latinos, and Latinos, "Who are not the question?"
And so, "How often, how many times? When I'm going to stop?"
And when I found out of my rights for this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year percent,
The last question of me, "How is to be a model to be a model of being a model of being a model of being a model of being a model of being a model of my life?"
And I think they expect them, they expect, "If you're a little bit of thinner and limited hair, and you feel very happy and fabulous and fabulous and fabulous and fabulous and fabulous."
And Backstage, we give answer that maybe this impression.
We say, "It's really greative, and it's greative, and it's greative, inspiring, inspiring, suffering."
All that's true, but it's just the half of the story, because what we never said, "I never said, "I've never say, "I feel like, I've never say, "I feel sure."
And I feel like me, because I have to think about my exception, because I have to think about my exception.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I be happy when I was happy when I was serious legs and limited hair and limited harm?"
And then you should make a few mathels, because they have the thinner, because they have the most district and the most coolest harm and they're the most coolest clamothes, and they're the most women on the planet.
When I wasn't prepared to this talk about this talking about this, it's a honestly, because one of the picture, because one of a honestly uncomfortable, and I got to say, "I got all the benefits, and I got to my grandmic." And I got it. And I got it. And I got it'd belie
It was very difficult, it was very difficult to remote from unfortunately, and race opening a biggest nutrients, when I'm a nutrient.
But I'm also happy and I'm sure that I'm sure that I've been able to do it, and I think it's greatly, and I've been able to do this, and I wouldn't believe that I wouldn't believe my job, because then I wouldn't tell me how I wasn't going to tell my bo.
If you take something like this talking to you, then we all have the power of the power of the power of image in our mistakes and mistakes and mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never forget the words, I never forget that's never forget about life, "Son, living in the Exili World Bi World World him.
But who never would never be like a gaddafi Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the library revolution is broken by the waves of the waves of the waves of the waves of the waves, and in the Egyptian revolution.
I found myself with many other lobyers, and I had a lot of other Libyens, and outside a day of the corns and to start a revolution to start a revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Now, libysche and men and men and men and men, the first rule, the end of the regimes, the end of the regimes of the freedom, and social justice in the air.
They have an example, they've provided mutal directly by brutal dictatur Gaddafisedafishing.
They've shown sense of solidarity, from the east sense of the most further and the most further.
Finally, after after a months of six months, and almost 50,000 deaths, our country, our country, our country and the guyranize.
But Gaddafi, but a big citizens, a large corruption and the guy who's the corruption and the basis of course.
Over four decaddafis decaddafis Tyrannic regime, and the infrastructure, and the moral structure and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The desertification and the challenges and the challenges, I realized how many other women, like so many other women to build the civil society of loybia, and we're going to do with democracy and neverthal equal equal equal equal equal equal equal equal equal
And so, to 200 organizations were during and unmediately and unmediately, and in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After three years, I got back to Lybia, and I started to Lybia, and I started to organiasm, I started to the thought to the therapacity, human development, human development and leadership and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I women, I wrote the peacebuildings, a movement of women, leaderships, leaderships, it's public stories that are sociopolicy.
And when I met the politics, I met a very difficult environment, a collector that always stronger polarized by the egoistic politics of dominance and egoistic politics of dominance.
I was sitting a sense of peace and I had a women, and I had a women, and to reach other, and to reach a law, a law, a law, no matters, no matters, and to pick up and citizens and pick up and possible for possible for possible for p
And then we got took our initiative, and we've been successful.
Women women women, 17,5 percent of the National choice in the first choice for 52 years.
But slowly, but it's sure the euphory of choice and the whole revolution, we thought about news, we thought about news of violence.
And one morning, we wake up to the money, we have to changes and Sufi Gralf morn.
And then we got a morning, we got news about the messages on the messages and the message and the message.
And again, again, the morning of opened by the poor.
And really, we're really expecting under the milize of milize and their milize and their minds and their missing and their missing and their missing and laws and laws and laws.
Our society, against a revolutionary mind, polarized, polarized by the ideal and principles and principles, social general governance, social justice, social justice they had in the same way.
Intolerance, exploring and Rach, and Rach, and Raches of the question of the revolution.
I'm not there today today today with the success story of our redesigns and the choice and the choice.
And I'm a lot of today today, as a nation that we've been able to make the wrong choice and the wrong decisions.
We've been looking at our priorities.
Because the choice, the election of peace or security or security or safetybia.
Dides the reason last and the white and the women and the women and males and males and national peace and national birds and national birds?
No, she didn't.
What is it?
Why is going to be further and society and dominated by itself, and dominance and dominance and the dominance and the dominance of men?
Maybe the women didn't have the only one who has done the female values, but the female values and the gnade and the including the gnade.
Our society needs a national dialogue, and consenservational voice, and they've been brought the polarization and decision and decision and decision and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative connection of the female of the female, quantitative connection of the female body needs.
We have to stop in the name of the name of the name of the roof and a day of the roach.
We have to start with the name of the middle of the gnade.
We have to develop a female discurs that wouldn't just going to do not just to do it, but also to do it, but also to work, together, collaboration, collaboration, collaboration, instead of conclusion.
These are the ideals that have a communicate that a committed lybia to make peace to get peace to get peace to get peace.
Because the peace has an alchemic and in this alchemic and in this alchemics of the femines and masculin sweets.
This is the real road.
And we have to do that, we have to do it before we do it before we do it sociopolitical.
After a vision of the Coran "Salam" -- "ist the word "ist the word "ister."
The word "rawing," and that's all over the traditional transmitions, the same Arabic well, and the same as the word "rahem" and symbolized the word "Mymbolized by the mother, the whole feminal humanity and the health and the health and the health and the
And just like the motherleible the embryo, who grows up in him, completely, it's so nutrients, the whole existence of the middle of the middle of the existence.
And so we said, "My Gnade, "My Gnade all things."
And so we said, "My Gnade, "My Gnade."
Maybe we're going to be the gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country, and I grew up with the song with the song with the song.
And I was very proud.
In school, we were looking at the history of Kim Il-ship, but we didn't really much about the world outside of America, America, South Korea and Japan our fine.
While I was often asked me, I thought, I thought I was going to spend my life in North Korea, I would spend my life in North Korea.
And they saw years, I saw a public head of public he thought, but I thought, my life in North Korea.
My family wasn't work, and I had to live myself.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter of letter of a college of a collegin.
And that's what they were going to be here, we're going to be family members are nothing more on this world, because we've been for two weeks.
We're going together on the ground and our body, and our body, soon as well die."
I was so horrified.
I heard the first time, I heard about that people in my country.
And just went to the both in the bothof, and I saw something that I couldn't get anymore I can't solve my memory.
One of the woman living on the ground, and a high school, and a high school in their arm, in their face.
But no one had to half of them because all of them because all of themselves, and they were to care of themselves and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big character in North Korea.
At the end of north Koreaner of North Koreaner's falling, and many other than just because they were just because they were just because they just because they just because they were just because they're just because they're just because they're just survival.
And so, the cases were always been highly holding me all of the bright, extraordina on the other side of China on the other side of the other side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the s
And I always asked me why they had no lights and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors.
This is the river of the river, which is the bordership between North Korea and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China and China
As you can see the river, the river, and it's very simple, and it's the rivers.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't say much about how to say North Korea, but I can say that I can say that I can tell you that I could turned to China's sentency.
I thought I was a short time of a short time of my family.
I never thought that it would never thought it together to live together.
In China was very hard to live without living without family without family.
I had no idea of how the life as the life as a north Korean Fling his life as a north, but I realized that it's not just extremely difficult, but also very hard, but also very hardly. Becorean flights. Becorean flight.
So I lived in countries, I thought that my real identity, and you would have a terrible sending me to north Korea.
One day, my biggest alptraum, when I was likely when I was brought by the Chinese police and in the police, and in the police.
Somebody referred me to be north Korean, so they testing my Chineseks and asked me and asked me, and asked me.
I had this kind of fear, I thought I was exploding my heart.
Would anything, of course, I could be innatures, I could be inside, and I could be done.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I did, I felt it, but I felt like my feelings and answered and answered the questions.
After they were asking them with the example, a couple of other: "That was a false.
It's not a north Korean."
And they'd running. It was a miracle.
Some North Korean, some North Korean messages in China, but many, but many, many of Chinese police and records and records.
These girl had girlucky.
While they were expecting, they were sleeping, they were finally free international pressure international pressure.
These north Korean, they didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, unfortunately, and they're going to be north Korea, and after north Korea, where they're followed, or publicly highly highly highly highly highly history.
While I was lucky, I was lucky, it's not so much other north Korean north Koreanists.
It's tragic that North Korean, their identity and hard to survival, and hard to fight.
And then they learned a new language, and working on a new language, it can be done in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of hidden, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started to go back to South Korea.
Mich in South Korea, I never had a bigger challenge, when I thought it was thought it was thought it was thought it was thought it was a bigger.
English was so important that I had to start to learning, I had to learning language.
And I started took the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all the Korean, but inside, we've been very excited, we've been able to be part of 67 years of part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the technology.
I fly through an identity crisisisisis.
Am Island or North Koreanerin?
Where do I get? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country more, that my home,
While I wasn't southern Corean life didn't easy, I had a plan.
I'm going to take me to the attention to the university.
And just as I was a new life, I was graduate, I got a bad, I got a bad call.
The north Korean Beholds, the money I started my family, and as a street, and as a streets, and as a street, and I was absolutely on the country.
They had to fast as possible as possible to planning her flight.
North Koreaner, an incredible strong stream.
It's almost impossible to overcome and South Korea, and Ironically taken airplane, I was going back to China and I got to China and I got to China and I got to China.
Because my family doesn't have to language, I had to suffering in more than 2,000 miles.
The busycled a week, and we've been able to get more mentioned.
Once again, when the bus, a Chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the experience, and he started asking questions.
And so I didn't understood, I thought I was going to be able to be able to start.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided to decided to him, and she said that they were deeply, and I was doing their attention.
He looked at measured measure, but happy, he thought he was suspecting me.
We did it until the limits, but I had to get the bordership, but I had to borders of Laos to borders of Laos.
But even after we had the borders had been concluded, my family inhabily inhabities, because of illegal border.
After I had to give money, and small money, my family inside of a month, but I was inside of a month. But I was in the city of Laws.
This was one of the biggest rest of my life.
I had done everything to family to family to family, and we were so close to the family, but my family, just before the South Korean message.
I went down and I went down and I was trying to relatives and the police, and I tried to family, but I didn't have enough money, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And so I asked me the voice of a man, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a friendly care of it.
In advanced English and with a words, and I would explain my situation and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two more money and two more north Koreaner to get them out of the prisoners to get them out of the prison.
And I thanked him from a whole heart and asked him, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he said.
"I help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The first thing that's what the moment, and it takes a new hope for me to take a new hope that the North Korean, and he showed me the friendly, and he showed me the foreign and the support for the north of the north, the north, the northern Cancy.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I recorded to explain, but the freedom, but the freedom.
Many north Koreaner, they're distressed by their families, and soon as they get in a new country, they don't have a little bit of money.
The international community can help us to help us to help us exercision, the education and many mountain and many more.
We can also be the bridge of the people in North Korea and the outside of us, because many of us in contact with families, and we're staying with families, and we send up information and money, north Korea of the north Korea.
I had a lucky, so much hope and inspiration in my life, I hope that I hopeful north Korean north Korean success.
I'm sure you're going to see more successful north Koreaner in the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've just one bit.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't talk about it, but he can't communicating in a way that it couldn't be some of the best speaker.
Remi knows what love is love.
He's shared it, and he's shared, and he's uncomfortable.
He's not just approaches. He doesn't work on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious unligious differences, and you've never tell you a lying.
If he songs from our childhood, when he was trying to remember the words, I remember one thing: how little bit about the important thing: how little we know about the unknown, and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16th. He's very good. He's very good.
He's got an absolutely uncomfortable memory.
But he also has a selective.
He can't remember if he remembered my satisfaction, but it remembers, but it remember the public songs, he was four, he was four, he was four, when he was four, when he was four, when he was fourth of the teletises on my left.
Do they don't hear about it?
But many people don't agree.
And in fact, because their understood because it doesn't minds of normal version of normal paste, they're often wrong.
But what my heart, and my heart, and my soul, although that was that, although it was the case, even though they were not as a non-like, that it was just autism, that they were extraordinary and autistic and extraordinary and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who don't trusted to be so such autism, it's autism" -- it's a complex function of the brain, which is a communications that are social communications that learning and sometimes.
It's also extraordinary individual, it's about it is different than Sam.
And the world is going to be a new person autism, a new person autism, and although it's one of the most fastest growing developments of the world, there's no known for the world, there's no known as a healing or healing.
And I can't remember the first time I remember when I'm autism, but I can't remember any day.
I was born, I was born, when my brother, and I was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creatures in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play how it seemed to be able to be able to be very interested in me.
Remi, and I lived in his own world, and he found in his own rules, and he founded with his own rules, like, like, like, like, a series in a series in a series of whatever it's all about what it.
And when he was older, he was differently, and the differences were different.
But behind the wutanted and the frustrial and the Frust and the number of hyperactivity was something really unique, and unique, a boy, a boy, a boy who had never saw, a human being, who never saw.
And also, extraordinary.
Now, I can't live that there was some of the moments of moments in my family, moments that I wished, moments that I wish I wish I wish I wish I would be exactly like I would be like I would be like I would be like I would be like I'd be.
But I'm going to go back to the ideas that they've taught me to the idea that they're talking about Individuality, and I understand that this is the things I don't want to understand that this is not going to be thousands of normality.
Normality is the beauty, the differences that are the differences, and the fact that we're not significant, that one of us is not that one of us.
It means that there's a different kind of responsibility.
And if I could just say, if I could say, and then you couldn't be able to be normal, you don't have to be normal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a gift, and we have a gift of us has a gift of us, and in everyone is the striveness is the ultimate open-like victimate victimate opencial.
The chance to the scale, range, range and walls and walls in the moment where we're trying to be another.
Please, don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edggged us with your filled us and neurosurosity, and neuroscience, and apple, and with apple, and with a million second, and with a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and see the world, and see the world with a million or a billion pictures per second.
I'm going to show you a new way of photography, the femto-Femto-Femto-Footography, which is that they can actually make time, that they can make time.
And so we can build cameras that we can build a cameras that we can look at each other, or without a <unk>-ray in our body in our body, and really in our body, and really in our body, and really, "Camera."
And if I take a laser potential, and I can take a billion switches, and they're more and more femtoseconds -- that's more femtoseconds, I'm going to breaketer, and that's a millimeter, and this project, and this project, and this project, this project, and this
So if you take this projectil, this projectil, and it's going to take this botons in these botons in these botons in the botones in the botones in the botones?
How does light in time?
So this whole events.
So, think about it, the whole events actually less than a nanoscience of a nanoscience -- so slowly to return this strong to cover this video to the factor, but I'm going to see the factor of the factor of this video.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't funded this research.
So, in this movie, so you can show you a lot, so let me show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, we drive into the flasketches with a photones, and it starts to move and finally, and that's breaking inside.
And one part of the light, and you see the table, and you see these table and you see these effects.
Many of the photones of photones of the lastest pastestrian the flowers and exploding in different directions.
As you can see, there's air, air, which is air.
And as the waves are breading waves on the table, and because of the reflexions of the reflexions of the reflexions of the focused on the end of the flash.
If you take a single projectility projectil, and it's the same strecks and the video, and the video, and you have to see how long you have to see how long you've got to see how long you've got to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a week.
That would be a very slowly slow film -- from a slowly, normal projectil in movement.
And how does it look like a pilotography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the wall, and the wall.
It's like if you have a small in a teacher.
I mean, it seemed like this, the nature of nature, the nature, the natural picture, but of course, but of course, our eye, of course,
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that when you'll see that when the light, you're going to remain the tomate, they're not going to remain.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and the light in their light and the light and after after after after after after after after after after a few seconds.
So in the future, if these femto-camera in your camera in your camera in your camera, it could be able to go into a supermarket, and if a fruit, and if a fruit, you can touch it.
So how did my teamera on MIT this camera?
So, as a photograph, you know, if you know, you know, you have a little bit of light, but we have a billion light, but we've got a billion times faster than your course, so well, so well, you get a light.
So we're doing this project, we send this projectil, this projectil, and we'll show you that millions of simplicity and recoverytes and these gigabytes of data, and we're going to calculate these female.
And we can take all these roofs and doing so interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other harvestigible, but how would it be able to see if it could be a new superpowerful superheroes: to see editors: to see editors?
The idea is that we're doing something light on the door.
It's going to be able to go back to the room, a part of it will reflects, and then finally, and then we could use this camera, and we could use these more simplicity.
And that's not a science fiction. We've been built it.
Links, you see our femto-Kamera.
And the wall is a puppet, and we're going to let the door, and we're going to let the door.
After our treatment in the "Nature Communication" was published by Nature, it was made by natural communications, and they've been able to do this animation.
We're going to get these lights, and they're going to get away, and they're going to get a little bit of the photones, and they're going to be able to get the puppets, and then we're going to let the light, and then the light, and then the door, and then the door. And then the door of the door of the door
And because we have a camera that's so faster -- our femto-camera has a unique abilities.
She has a very good time, and she can look at the world, and it can look at the world.
And of course, we know, of course, but also the door, but also the door, but we don't know what we don't know what the point, which is the point.
And then we can see a laser, we can see a rooh-producation, how they do -- how they do -- not really sense of these screen, but if we can see many of these images, and then we're trying together, and they try together, and they try together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got some of the lab, we can see the lab, and we can see the practice, we can see the cars, we can see the collisions, and we can see what's going to see what's going to see in the curve is behind the curve.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, it's very exploring, which is why it's really a way to think about femto-Femto-Femto-Femto-Femto-Footography.
So, as well, and we can't have a scientists, and there's a scientists, and there's a collection of the ultra-controlled, and I realized that all of these gigabytes that we can't just small scientifically collection.
But it's also happening here.
If you look at these waves under the waves, you see that the waves, you see that the waves.
The waves to move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we're almost in light, because we've almost in light, weird effects and an incredibly watched this picture.
The relationships, in the events in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, so that you can relationships, so by taking the relationship, so we can correction of space and time, we can correction.
So no matter whether we should be able to create engaging the medicine, or the medicine or new driving for the medicine or new data, and we've data and data and details on our website opening up and the "Sover and that we've made up and that the "So,
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of our opportunities can improve our lives.
We don't meet every night, we don't get anything so that we don't have a lot of wisdom, but we use the same public places.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and shared to share things like Acleber, skills and crops and crops.
The projects that I came out of my questions, how much might be asking my neighbors?
How can we teach us to stopped to stop doing anything?
How can we leave our memories and shared to share the country and the country?
And how can we share our hopes for living homes, so that our communities, so that our communities and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea soul is going to be clearly highly hundreds of years, being hundreds of years, beds and trees and trees, and I'm trusting to urban music.
I think every time, every time, if someone nobody, there's no planet.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings, but it's also the city of the world, but they're also leave the city of America.
I live in the house, and I thought about how I could have changed it. And I thought I could also changed my life for something that my life for us to changed my life forward.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, and she was suddenly and unexpected.
I thought about death, and I thought, and I feel a big disease, and it brought me clarity about the things that are important.
But it's hard to me, these sort of view of every day.
It's easy to forget to forget and forget, and to forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends and I leave a huge house, and I wrote a huge slone, and I wrote a slone, "Bevorite, I want to be a piece of anyone who can be a piece of your life, I can take a piece of a piece of a p
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could experiment, but the next day, the next day, and they'd been filled, and they keps.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to die, I want to be away because of piratric."
"Bevorite, I want to die, I want to stand up the International datums.
"Bevor I want to die, I want to die for millions."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to plant."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to live "nethancement."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to die in my arms."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to be someone's going to be a cavaluate."
"Bevor I want to die, I want to be myself."
This is a sense of place, and it was sense of sense of sense of the hope and dreams and dreams of the people, and the laughters and wearing me, and wearing me.
It's about knowing that you don't know anyone.
It's about understanding our neighborhood and that is a new way to a new way.
It's about place for remember, and to remember and remember what we're doing, and what we're most important, and we grow and change us.
I did this last year, and I made a hundreds of neighborhoods that were building a community that we wanted to build a walls, and so I've been building a colleagues like colleagues like article in countries like arts, South Africa, South Afric
We've shown how much power our power our power, when we have the opportunity, our voices, and more with others.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world is important than ever before, it's important than ever thinking about the right bit of thinking about it, and think that's life is careful.
We're often going to talk about death, about death the death to think about death, but I realized that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that we're mostly stronger.
The thought about death is a death is using the life.
Our common summer places on the best thing that we're in the best idea and as a community, and with more possibilities, and we can help us to share and stories, and stories, and they can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us better places.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me with an employees. A special problem for everyone who's a particular mathematics are considered to be companies.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to explain the trial to explain what I do.
Tancing is one of the most activities.
We're crazy of the ballet of mostly balletts and soups and same ballettle and same thing.
And so, a ballet is an extraordinary ballet scale and abilities and abilities and abilities, and abilities that could have a genetic componential events that could have a genetic component.
Trains, destroy neurological stories like Parkinson't slowly this extraordinary. That's what I do, and that's what was a ballettuose.
Over the years, you've done a lot of research for many range.
And yet, there's a hospital, and there are suffering in this disease, and they have to live with the unexpected symptoms like symptoms, symptoms that are causing these disease. That's why we need to be able to use the centures that we need toold.
We have to measure the progressive message, and finally, and finally, and finally, really, really, if we have a single time we have answer that question, that question.
<unk>rorists is that there's no evidence, and other evidence, so you can't have a biomarker, so you can't do. The best thing that is this 20-minutants.
You have to do it in the clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very extraordinary studies, and it's never done.
But what if patients could do if patients could do with this test?
That would be a hard a hospital tour in the hospital. What if patients, what if patients?
It wouldn't be a teenhouse personal hospital.
It costs <unk>300 percent, 300 percent, in the neurological distribution.
And so I want to tell you a unconventional methods that we're trying to get to do with which we're all trying to get in a sense of the senses like my recognition.
So here's a video of video of video of video.
This is what happens in healthy when someone who's a spread. We can look at the current ballettings, because we have to look at all of these vocide all these vocide, and we have to coordinate the genes, and we all have the genes.
And as Ballet, it's enormous amount of transmitted.
Think about how long a child, how long a kid, until it's talking about it.
And by the skin, we can create the vibrating stimulate stimulate struggle, and as the greatest morgans of Parkinson.
And on the bottom of the both appearance for example of unregular stimulus,
We're always see the symptoms.
Voice, swaking, swaking swakeness.
The language is going to be slightly and it's an example, and that's an example of it.
And this is only one of the voice, sometimes, sometimes, but sometimes, sometimes, and sometimes, and presentation struggle, and Prescently, combine, combine, combine learning, and we can now be very advanced with new middle of the middle of the middle of the mid
How can these tests with clinical mes? Well, they're not smart, they're both of the neurologists.
And they're slightly. The infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. There's not being the voice, and it's not led by experts.
So you can be done by itself.
They're very quickly, three seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If there's something extremely, you can also use it in great ways.
And this is amazing goals, we can now reach.
We can reduce logistically reduce patients.
Patients don't have to lead to read the clinics in the clinics.
We can see if we can do this data, we can explainment.
We can do is crime mass explored to clinical studies and it's only a subjects of the whole population of the population of the population.
We've got the opportunity to look for the first time to look for the disease, before it's before it's before it's before it's before it's not too late.
Today, we're doing this direction, we started the parkinson's Parkinson's simm-Initiative.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to make enough to make enough exciting enough exciting enough exciting for the exciting of these goals.
We have a called Ruffering the driving a billion people on this planet,
Everyone, or without parkinson, it can be approaches to get a few center for a few center for a few center. I'm going to be able to get to be able to be eight hours of our goal.
Thank you.
If you go from, we say, we say 10,000 people say, "You can say, who are healthy and who isn't healthy and who isn't healthy and who isn't healthy, who are you healthy, and who are you?
What do you do with all these probably?
What happens is that the patient is that the patients have to be a call of parkinson, whether these parkinson. OK.
Some people don't get it to the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These are important, because we're important, because we're really important to parkins for parkins for parkinson.
At the time, you have 86 percent decision?
It's much better.
My students, I have to love him, because he's got to be fantastic worked -- has shown that it's also showed that it's also functioned, and we're going to be able to enables, and we're in 9 percent.
That's what I call a better.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the cell phone, and people can do with parkinson't go to the test, their voice, their voice, so that they can take the doctor of the disease of the disease of the disease.
That's what we do.
Thank you. Max Len: Thank you.
Thank you, Tom.
So here's what I live in Kenya on the southern Randi National Parks.
In the background, you see the cows of my father's the national park.
The Nairobi national Park is just in the south, just in the south. That means that Wildtiretiate that wildtirelated the parks.
The regularly, the solutions, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that were killed. I wake up. I wake up, and I found it was dead. It was dead. It was our only bully.
My stamm who believed in the massai, we believe that we came together with our animals and the why we got together, so much.
And I learned to hate solutions.
Our warrior cured morane. They're protect our struggle, and our heart. They're actually brought this problem.
And they kill the solutions.
Here's one of six solutions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's a national Park, there's just so little national park.
In my stamm is a boy between six and nine years, and nine years, and it was also a box, and so I went to me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Lions for fire. Lions for fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to see the solutions, but the cows to see the cows.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go on.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a bird fluor.
I wanted to think that the solutions, I thought I was standing.
But solutions are very clearly clues.
They come up, you see the birds and go back. And then they come back. But they're going to go and say, "You know, that's still there.
And they're going to kill our viety.
One night, I wake up the case. I love with a fackel in the hand around him, and this time, and this time, and this time.
Lion for a light for a light that's moving.
I had an idea.
And I was a little boy, I worked all day, I used took the whole day, and I took the new radio of my mother radio of my mother. But I had learned me. But I had learned me.
I took an old autobattery and autobattery and a motorcy. The one motorcy. It's right or left. He wants to be blind.
And I was worried about a switch to make the lights and except the lights.
This is a little bit of a little bit of capses.
And then I built everything.
The solar panels the battery, the battery, the battery, and I call it a turning the direction. I call it a transformator.
And the direction of blind.
You can see that the births, because of the outside, because of the solutions.
And so this is what it looks like if they come up.
The lights blink and the solutions, and the case, I was about the case. That's all the time, I was the whole time in the bedroom.
Thank you.
I've been installed this installed and since we didn't have a problems.
And then we heard our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had many of their animals, and they lost my animals and she asked me if I could ask her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the solutions in the background.
Since I've got seven houses in the neighborhood and they're really good.
My idea is now used to be used in all the cenya, even for other robots like hyes or leopards. The lights. The lights.
My invention, I'm going to a stip at a stip at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse international school, and I'm really excited.
My new schools, and I'm going to helps and helps and recording and recording.
I even my friends with friends with my friends and we've been using the lights, and I'm not using the lights, and I'm showing people, and I'm using them.
A year I just a boy from the Savanne, who was high school. I saw his father's watched me and said, "I'm going to sitting in a sitting in a sitting!"
And here's what I'm going to do.
I thought with a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm airplane, I want to be airplane and pilots.
From the solutions, but I can save my invention, I can save the cows of my father's live invention, and we can live without side, side, side without street.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I'm going to tell you very much.
You don't know how much it's not what it's like you're hearing a story like your story.
So you've got this stipingium.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list of the list?
So my next invention, I'm working on a electric couple of electrical caunch?
Yeah, I know, electrical cells are already have been invented to have my own.
You've been trying to get a little bit, not trying to try and I've been tried to give it, but I tried to give it, because I got a sleep.
Everything is hard Tures, you're a little bit of best.
We're going to take you on every step out of your ways, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
And I'm since I'm a camera in the hand, is a photography, but I want to share with you today, but I want to share with you 15 of my favorite.
There was no kind of director, no style, no chance too shoot a picture. Not even the picture. Not even the returns out.
And in fact, mostly, mostly, mostly, mostly decided by the tourists.
My story begins when I was a talking about a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, and my daughters on my first birthday on my arm. We were on my arm. We were five.
And that's what we were later, we were able to decided to do is same picture, we same picture.
Well, you can see what you can see, you can see.
When the thirday, my daughters, my wife, "Hey, why, why you don't you sabina, why don't you do it a father-time, and it's a violence to lead to lead the ritual?"
And then we started to make a picture of tourists, we're going to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, how universal, if you're notice, if you're not really foreign.
Nobody said no one has ever said no one has ever been told and fortunately, and someone with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much of our lives, how much of our lives.
This journey is very holy.
This is just after the 11,11, and I had to come up and I had to explain what happened to understand what happened to understand that a five-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-old.
These images are much more than just a far more than just a certain moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way of us to change a week for a week, and how we're going to change our time, and how we change our time, not just physically, but in all of us.
Because always doing the same image, changes our perspective of Mal. While they're always new miles, and when they see new miles, I'm going to see how they see how they look at how it looks like it.
These very intense very intense, and we spend with each other, and every year we're expecting every year.
Last, as a last, while one of our rice, we were going to place, and suddenly, and they're suddenly red, she shows them how they love to a pupples to a pupping a little kid, where they love learned rice.
And she told me about her feeling of her feelings that they had five-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-olds.
She said that they remember how to remember the heart of the breast nine years ago, when they saw the first time they saw the first time.
And now she looked at New York after high schools, because they're in New York.
And I realized, I realized, the most important thing we all create, memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of the idea of a creative role in the most important memories of memories.
I don't know how it looks like this, but I'm going to look at 15 pictures, I'm going to get a families.
I'm always the picture.
I want to get today today, and I want to get to get to ask you to ask someone who don't you ever asked, "Would you do?"
Thank you.
