When I was 11 years old, I was 11 years old, I was born in the sounds of the sound.
My father hearded on his little radio the new radio the news of the BBC.
He saw very happy to be very happy to be unusual, because often was unusual, because the news.
He called "The Taliban are walking.
I didn't know what that means, but it made my father, but it made my father.
"You can go to a real school," he said, "You know," he said.
I'm not going to forget about it.
Actually, a real school.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, and I spent six, and I spoke to school.
So I released myself, I five years, I five years, and I began to a boy, and I started to approached to approached to a shoes.
And so we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way took a different way, so that he could never methin we went to where we went.
We hidden our books in the books in the moment, so we would go to the way we'd just going to go.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girl in a small webs.
In the winter was incredibly, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
And over again, the university had to be able to a week, because the Taliban, because the Taliban,
We never were never secured about us.
Does they asked us?
Who do they know where we live?
We had afraid, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a big degrees in a family, in the education as important and daughter and daughter.
My grandfather was his time.
Afghanistan from a devinced provinced provinced afghanistan. He was to school -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother, and he was released for its father.
My based mother, but my mother was teacher.
It's her.
Two years ago, they went to the restand, just to transform our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this was the first in his family, who was ever received a school.
And it was clearly clear that his children would be a education, but also his daughter, but its daughter, but it's drops.
He saw it as a much bigger risk of his kids, his kids don't go to school.
I know exactly that I've been able to do this for the Taliban sometimes, from our lives, from our lives, from the perspective.
I was a good latest pleasure, but my father said, "Thatter, you can hear about your life.
Your money can be done. You can be done. You can be in war.
But one thing is going to stay, you're always being here. And even if we're going to stay with our blood for your blood for your blood for your blood.
So -- you want to still you still want to still?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that's been destroyed by decades.
Less than 6 percent of the women have a higher than the women's less than the second, and if my family. And if my family for my family for my school.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a stolventin of the Middlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather, who was family, who was family, because he was away from his daughter to school, one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first greatest.
He doesn't just talk to my high school, but also with my high school, but also, I was the first woman who was the first woman who was dangerous.
My family believe me.
I have a big dreams, but my family has greater dreamily dreams for me.
So I'm a global message for 10x10, a global campaign for the world.
So I've been helping SOLALA, SOLALA, and maybe some internat for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girl.
It's wonderful to see how the students to my school with great earlier with great earliers.
And to see how their parents and dads for them, as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well.
So as Ahmed. It's not his face, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
And it was a month, his daughter and heimself on the home of SOLA in their village, and they're the streets of the road.
When he got home, he sounded the phone, and he sentence, and he threatened his daughter, he sent to school, they would try to school.
And he said, "Till you want to situation, but I'm not going to situation, I'm not going to situation, I'm not going to situation."
What Afghanistan, I've been recognized something that's going to be able to get to the most often, most of us who are successful, the value of our daughter, and the value of his daughter, and that their success.
It's not hotter to play that our mothers don't play in our success.
And they're a lot of them are the ones that are starting to convince and think about a lot of future, and they're going to be a lot of their daughter, but in a society like the infghanistan, the inevisible.
And we were just a few hundred girls of girls -- because it was the girl -- because it was the girls.
But today, everywhanistan about three million girls of girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America,
The American, as we're seeing how we're going to change.
I don't think the change is not from Durers are not from During the America, and the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I'm a students in my school, and their parents that they're going to be a lot of parents that they're going to see a lot of future, I see a lot of future and a long future.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unfortunately possibilities, and that girls, and the girls that girls.
And so I think they've got a big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, even my life -- my life -- my life -- my life -- I was in Africa as young man.
In 1971 to 1971, I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Kenya, Algeria, Algeria and Somalia, Algeria and Somalia, with African countries.
I've been working for an Ialia NRO, and every single project that we put on the legs we put on the legs.
I was taken.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're good people and good working in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we all killed.
Our first project, which is my first book called "Ripples inspired by the Zambi" inspiring, one where we wanted to show up the sambias, like food.
We came with Italian Saatgut in South South South South Asi Flussi flying Tal, and we led to the Sambia, and we learned the southern of application and cocular tomates and cocine.
Of course, the answer to the an interests, so we pay for the work, so we pay for the work, and sometimes they were doing it.
We were amazing that there was no country in a so early deal with a country.
But instead of asking why they didn't look at why they were just "God, we just said, "God."
"Great, it's right now to save people to save people to save the people to save the collection."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice, they were so big, in Italy, they were so big, they were so big.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Sambian, like, "Shambshood."
When the tomates were red, and red, about 200 nights of 200 nights from the river, and I asked all.
We said to the Sambian: "Oh God, God, the Nilp.
And they said, "Yes, we haven't got no country here."
"Why didn't you asked us?" "You've never asked us."
I just thought we were so great, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the American, I saw what the England changed the Englands, I was doing what they did, I was pretty stold.
We felt the fights to the nilp.
They should see the uncertainly -- you should see the uncertainly, we don't see the African people.
They should read the book "Dead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambic economist.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We've countries have given the African continent 1.5 trillion Euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has told you.
Let me just reading her book.
Let me tell you about a African, which we've got to be.
We're a western people are imperialists, colonialists, and there's only two species, and we're just two species, or we're patriarchal.
Both words are coming from the latines," which means "pather" means "Father" means.
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchalian: I'm treating a different culture, they would love you to my children.
Patronizing: I'm treating a different culture, they would be my service.
So people are called people in Africa, "bwana,"
I became a growing up when I was a book called "Small Island," he said, "Smaker, and he said, in the economy, if people don't want to go into the help.
This is the first principle of the help of the help.
The first principle of help is Respect.
Today, the morning of the heart of this conference, and asked a stab on the ground and asked, "Can you're going to imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react with people, and he was a system called companies, and they never reactly never motivated, no one initially, but you're going to be a service, but you're going to be the position of the pion of the pion of the position of the pion of the paint
What you do -- you do -- you do the mouth.
You never reached a community with ideas, you're set up with the sky.
We don't work from Books.
We're coffeeee. We make us in Caf<unk>s.
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally finally figure out what the person wants to find out what the person wants to find out.
The most important thing is the most important thing.
You can give someone else.
If these person don't like this?
The passenger for the person is the most important thing is the most important thing.
The passion for the passenger is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge, because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea has not the idea, but it's not the knowledge.
A lot of years ago, why I had this instead of statt instead of saying, why don't we hear about why don't we hear them? But not together? But not together.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with communities.
And I never have never been shared, and they're never going to say what they want to tell their money to see what they want to see.
All right now, this blind, this blind.
The most farming people who don't know because they're never going to be able to public meeting.
We're working a single to do this, to do this, a social infrastructure that are not existed.
A new mountains need to be created.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bedrooms that are in the house, in your house, and in the caf<unk> sitting in the caf<unk> the middle of your passion in a way that life in a way to transform your passion.
I tried this in Its trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do this instralia.
I was trying to get to the time and trying to get out where we're going to do what they're doing, and what they're doing.
And so I just love to the first year, and I had a street, and I had three days. I him. I him. He was him. He was called him. He was Maori. I him, he was Maori. I him, and I was him to organize and organize.
I think this fish fishes, and I'm going to work with these wonderfish thunfish is not going to sell you about 60 cents<unk>Kilo to Japanese, but after Japan for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government, and the government, "How do you do that?
How do you.
I hold the mouth and hold it."
So -- -- -- so -- So the government: "Make it again."
We've done it in 300 communities.
We've got 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are involved in a sense.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies, one of the story, story, story,
Peter pressure was philosophyprofessor, before he was businessor,
All right now is the death of the entrepreneurs.
So you build Christch, without knowing what the most farming human Christch, and their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get this to get this.
You have to help them discretion and privacy and privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them, and they're going to get them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
So what presentation have you applian you're at most applauded?
<unk>respretty, they have applications. They have applaud.
I want to say that entrepreneurs is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- novely burning fossil fuels, fuels, and suddenly, and suddenly, and systems that are not sustainable.
The connection of the powerful machine is not sustainable.
The friend of instruction is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we need to look at seven billion people on a sustainable ways, holds, and we can transport them with them.
The technologies are not existing.
Who is this technology for the green revolution? Universities? Universities?
The government? Covernment?
It's going to be considered.
I'm going to read a food story in a food of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were in the future of experts town the future of New York in 1860.
In 1860 came together, and speculated in 100 years, which would happen in 100 years. The New York. The city: The city: The city wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? You saw the curve, and they said, if the population in this tempocation in this tempo further, they needed six million paths to be able to stop the people who would be impossible to finish with the mistakes.
Because they went to the mind.
1860, they see the bad technology that life from New York,
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, in 19001, there were 1001 cars -- 1001.
The idea of a different technology, a different technology, the running. There were little factory. It was a little factory.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
As first, we need to be able to be discussion.
And they don't come to you.
And as a next thing you need to relate them, engaged and empty service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the smallest company, all of the smallest company, three things: Three things, three things that need to be selling. It's got to be selly and the financial and the financial and the financial.
Do you like?
We never met a single person who are producing something that can produce something like this, and we're going to sell the money.
It's not exists.
These person was born.
We've been looking at research and our 100 iconically, the world, Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Edison, Google, Google, Google, Google, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Yahoogle, Google, Google, Google,
There's just one thing that all successful companies have been a common, just one: No one: No one person.
Now, we're going to teach 16-year-old companies, and we begin to start with the first two side of Richard Branson. The first two sides of Richard Bransons Autobiography. The first one of the 16-year-old.
No one of the time, and 32 times "wir".
He wasn't alone when he began.
Nobody green a company. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we create a community, in the middle of the middle of a smaller, and Bars and Bars and Bars and Bars and Bars. They're going to do what someone who's going to do for them.
What can you? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you can sell you on the money?
"Oh, no, no, I can't you." "Mo want to be you for you?"
We activate communities.
We've got groups of volunteers who are going to be able to help them to help them to help them to help them to help people. We've found that the wonderful population of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economy and that the economy and that economy and the econom
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be how it must be a wonderful, Alice in the wonderful.
The Penn State University, a Docentinary in communication -- a communication -- in communications.
I had afraid of afraid of it.
It's not afraid of these students with their great brains and their great books and their great books, and their great words,
But as the conversation, he was developed, it was like Alice, as Alice, and when they saw a door, and a door, and a door.
And so I felt like I felt like I was conversation with the students, I was amazing about the thought they had thought that they had to discovered that other of this wonderful.
I think to open this door to open, it means to open up this door.
We need to have unfortunately communication of our scientists and engineers and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the largest problems, like the largest problems, and if we don't understanding and health, and if we don't understand it, and I don't think it's not going to believe it's not applications.
But these great conversation are not to get to the scientists and engineers and engineers and engineers don't in their wonderful.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, smart.
I want to show you a few ants that we can see how to see how to see that we can see that the science and technology, and the technology and technology and technology and spaneously.
The first question that you need to answer is, is, is, is, right?
Say, why we're going to be so relevant for us.
Say not just that you can't just significant, but they also say that you can also tell us that their trabells that you can treat structure in our bones, because it's important to understand and understanding oil.
And if you do that, what you do is you do, then you're going to make sorry.
After all, a hands are a hands of your minds.
Surely, you could use your doctors and pretty much, but why don't you say, why don't you just understand what is it's a lot of understanding about us?
Our thoughts to make your thought is not the same as their nive.
As astein, "Make the things said, "Maching things like this. But not just as possible -- but not easy."
You can tell us something about your science is something about your science of science without a compromises without compromises.
A few things are certain things that are more certainly: examples, stories, stories. It can report them in your banned in your bann.
And if you're going to present, then the stories, the stories.
Have you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stichpoint"?
What happens when someone else? Another one is going to get another, and with these points, and with these points.
A follows like this is not just slowly, but also, but also too much on the language of our brains, and we're going to be fast and we're fast.
This example of genevievieve Brown is much more effective. It's much more effective structure of the traffic, it's so stability to the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration of the effective design of the effective design of the effective design.
The trick here is, one is to use a simple sentence of sentence, which is audience, if it can be losing the audience, orientating the fact that can also relatives our other senses that are also related to the other sense of a deep.
These are just a few answer to see these door to see these door, and the door, and the wonderful and technology and technology and technology.
And the engineers I've been studying me, I've been able to make me in me," with the "Nerd in me, I want to make all of this with a same.
And there's a science of your science and your stories, and your multiple, and your relevance, so that's the audience, and multiplicated, and multiplicated the suffering of your work.
So scientists and engineers and engineers, if you've been solved in my sounds me.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handyridge, you can films of humanity in Syria.
With a handy, you can tweet a protestaction in Egyptian.
And with a handy, you can take a song, it's high-cloud and famously.
All of this is possible.
I'm a year in 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in this city.
There's a hundreds of thousands of people, and the streets of people, and the streets and the constrated.
We're in 1989 and imagine that all of these people who had these people who had changed on the handy in the pockets, a handy in the pocket.
Who is a handy, a handy on this?
You can highly high.
You can high your handy, you high, you high!
You can high. One is another one of the blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 columns.
Rohdata.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.Kommission a direction.
This direction is called Rightline is called the presence of recording.
These directly, that every telephone in Europe, every telephone in Europe, every Internet in the entire Europe, a bandwidth of bandwidth.
Who is it going to be? Who is it? Who is a Email?
Who is a send of a text?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years to two years of your phone or your phoney or your phone, or your Internetanbieved.
And everywhere in Europe, and people have said, "That's not going to want to be."
They said, we want to say, we don't want to be able to do this idea.
We want to be self-confidence in digital time, and we don't want to be the phone and Internet, and we need to store all of these information about us.
There were angry, Journalists, Priester who said, "That's not going to want to say, "That's not going to want to be."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of blindness and said, "Free and said, "Freece."
And some people say, somebody could be the state of Stasi 2.0.
The state was the secrets of the secretary in East.
And I asked myself, whether it really works.
Can you really all these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone called my phone called the Germany, the greatest telephone, and I asked them to Germany, and I asked her, and I asked them all information that I'd asked me.
And I asked her, and I asked her, and I didn't get a real answer. Nurel Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla B
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is my life,
So I decided to reflect a sense of a survival, because I wanted to have this information.
But the Germany telecom said, no, we're going to give you this information.
At the end of the end of a compared to them.
I'm going to send the attached me where they send me to send me.
Because in the twistically, the boundation of the edge of the E.U.U.
So I received this half-scale environment with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
Three-830 cells information.
First, I saw it, and I said, it's a huge dategy.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months in this datei.
So I was a little skeptical, what should I start with it?
Because you see where I'm sleeping, where I'm going to do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public and public.
I want to make them audience.
Because I want to show the people what the idea of what it means.
So without the time with Online and Open Data City.
This is a visualization of six months.
You can reincooms and radiooms, and you can imagine.
You can do any step that I do, you can do.
And you can see how I can see how I can see from Frankfurt with the stuff, and how many a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of air.
And it's possible to this information.
It's a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just so, I called my wife and she calls me, and we talked together.
And then I called me a few friends, and they call a couple of friends.
And after a while, and you're calling this giant communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they communicate apart to go to bed.
You can see all this.
You see the central figures, about who are the leaders, about who are the leaders.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect defect defect define a society, because you know who you know who's going to talk to which is a Email, which is possible when you're possible when you have access to this information.
And these information are going to be able to minute, in Europe, in Europe, in Europe.
As I said, we'd say, we're going to have all these people in the streets in the street in 1989 cell phones in her pocket.
And the state of the state that the state of the demonstration, and if the state, and if the state, and if the leaders are never happened to be.
The case of the mountain mountain maybe not statting.
And also, not the case of the ice of the ice.
Because today, because of course, and companies like so many information, how they can get to get together, and often, online.
They want to follow the possibility, and they want to be able to remain this.
But even self-confidence and a life in digital time in the digital time.
But you have to fight for the self-controlling.
They need to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you're going to tell your friends, privacy is a value of 21st century.
If you go home, you're going to tell your attacks, just because companies, and it's because companies have to specifically, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone called your phone society that they've been talking about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you're using your handy, you remember the self-time must be able to fight.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spiritual: Spiritual restaurants, bridge.
So the city planer, and so the name survived South Central South Central south Central, and they change it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes in South Los Angeles,
This is South Los Angeles.
Spiritual flies, snaurants, brestaurants.
So as 26.5 million other Americans live in the foods-worth Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-thrus and the drive bys.
The comic is that the drive leadership more people than the drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles,
The fatty is capacity in my fourth is currently higher than about 15 kills, the brought of 15 kilometers.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me how to feel like you wouldn't have access to healthy food if you would have a constantly when you go out of the house, the negative effects that negative effects the best effects of your fourth.
I'm going to sell that role in the role and sellings like buying.
I see dialysiscyseconds like starbucks like starbucks.
And I've got to listen to that.
I realized that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't have a latest, I had no longer rounds to get appledge to get apple, who's not with pesticides in the present.
So I plant a food week a food forest.
It's a piece of country that we call the parkanline.
It's 45,000 feet.
The thing is the thing that is the city of city.
But you have to pick it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I have to kep it."
And I decided to hold it in standard.
So I got and my group, and my group, and Green grounds, and we started to plant my food, and we started to plants, and Of-wald, so that's all the program.
We're a kind of a sort of group, and we're going together from all social stories and from all the social stories, it's completely free, and everything we do, and everything we're doing.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone who was a difficult.
The city city came up with me and he told me, and he said that I had told my garden, and said that I need to relaxed my gender.
And I thought, "Come, right?
A richeral approaches of food, applications of food country, which is deadly not a piece of country?
And I thought, "Cool. Hermany."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times, Wind, Steve Lopez Lopezz, and I spoke with the city of Green, and with a member of general reason. They were able to change a petition.
We thought you'd have the hands.
My city, my city, and he said that they're supporting it, and he said that we love.
So why don't they shouldn't it?
L.A.A.A. in the United States, most brought in the bridge of the city.
They're 67 kilometers.
These are 20 central Parks.
It's enough flower to plants to plants to plants.
Why would they find that they shouldn't it?
And by the task of a plant plants, you get 1,000 sames.
Within bohs in the value of a dollars in the value of 75 dollars in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my holds, I say, I'm going to build their own food.
His own food is like his own money is like his own money.
Look, I have a connection in South Central.
I wanted to get my sons there. I've been there.
And I remember that part of this imagined reality to be away from other people who were founded by other people, and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden is my graffiti. I plants. I plants.
And just as a graffiti coasts, the walls, the walls, beautiful, I beautiful, I'm called Rases and Parkanlaw.
I used to use the garden, the Earth, and the plants, and the trees and the trees are my dreams for these stressions for these cities.
They would be surprised what the earthquivalent, if you can use it as a country.
They can't imagine how amazing a sun, and how they're touched people.
So what happened?
I've experience how my garden, like my garden, and the relationship and the result of my fourth.
To change the community to change the community of the ground of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wondering how children are going to be conflict.
Garden is the therapists, and the most care of the most important act that you can do, especially within the city.
And you can get the earthquake.
I remember this time, when these mother, and her daughter and her daughter, it was circade, and I came out in my garden, and I came out.
I've been feeling bad, because they were there, and I said, "Wis you're going to do this, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the road."
I've been able to see people who were so close to me and hungry, and I've been asked me to do this.
And I said, "There, no, no, no, I don't think they don't think they're not afraid.
And it's the streets on the road.
But that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want them to take it back to the same time, I want them to take their health."
At the other time, I was a garden in this obsession in this obsession in Downtown L.A.
These are the guys who have helped me to decided to decide.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it's affecting and how they've plants and how they've plants and how they've been plants, and it was great for a moment.
Green reason is about 20 gardens have been plants.
And we got our environments came up within the 50 people, and they were all freedom.
If children carbon, children carbon.
If they signed tomates, they eat.
But if they don't get anything about it, if they don't get to the food and body and body and body and body and body, they eat.
I see young people who want to work, but they're going to work in this thing -- I see -- I see -- I see in this thing that's exactly on the path that they're nearly on the path.
The gardens, I see as a opportunity where we can train themselves to create their communities to get their communities to get a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carververton Carververton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverton Carverververververton Carverververververververververver.
But if we don't change the collection of the Edboard, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to share a whole we can share away from the same plants in the same blocks in the same block.
I want to take schiffscontain and they turn them into healthy caf<unk>s.
So, don't understand me.
I'm not talking about costless snow, because it's not sustainable.
The communicate is that you have to sustainability.
I'm talking about it, people who are working, and children from the streets, and they're going to get the streets, and the honor and the honor, and if you put your own food, and if you build bodies.
So what I want to do is to do is to do is to do.
I want to be able to be ecological rebells, gangster, gangster, gangster.
We need to reach the image of gangsters.
If you don't have a gangster.
Are you going to be able to do with the slight, right?
And let's be the weapon of your election.
If you want to make meet meeting, you don't want to make meet in the caves, and you want to make a meting and a meeting, and a meeting.
If you want to make meet meet with your garden, you can get to my garden, so we can plant to plants.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "It's unlikely politicians.
Although in the 19th century, a time in the 19th century, "Ein Snollygoster is someone who is someone who is someone who is a case of parents, independently, and its might be a last, and his success, and his success, and his heads.
I have no idea what's "speakeral.
And I think, some words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all the politicians that they try to control the language.
For example, for example, third loud of the British parliament, not the time, the same words of debate.
And that was actually back to the mutual back to the man's mutual name of a man's brass Crosby, who was in the Parlament.
She was helped him in the Tower of London and he was mutigrated enough, he was mutigrated enough to stress, and he was so much in London, and he was so much in London, he was so much in London, he was that he was so much in London.
And just a few years later, we find the first news for the first news for the first motion of the sentence.
Brasses are related to the English word for bad.
But that's not true. It's not going back to a returning to a press.
But to show you how words and politics and politics, I want you to take you to the United States, when they're just reaching the independence.
You saw the question of how to call George Washington, the state of Washington,
You didn't know.
How do you call the leaders of a republican nation?
And that's been debate in Congressed in the Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible for the possible advances.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouver Washington, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other people of America of America's Washington.
Not a presence of a presence.
Some people wanted to call it King it.
They thought that's what they thought.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king time spanne.
It would have work.
But everybody was incredibly slowly because these debate 3 weeks.
I've learned the days, I've learned the same thing: "Immer's the same issue.
The reason for the possible for the long time, and the longest house was the representation.
The representation didn't want to do that Washington, and they didn't want to be him.
Canighter, and they're going to bring him upon the ideas.
They wanted to give him the most most farmers, the most painful title,
This title was "President.
President. They don't existed the title. He was existed. But he's just required to a valuation.
It's kind of like the previously.
He didn't have more size than the record of "Auffer" or "Auff.
Sometimes, there were president little colonial community and governments and governments, but it was really an unfortunately a unfortunately titled Titel.
So this is why the senior him.
They said, "This is smile, you can't call him.
This classroom has to be able to describe and out of countries and out of the countries.
Who is going to take it, if he's going to take a dumbing little titles like President of the United States?
And also, after 3 weeks, the senat in the senat.
Instead, you know, you know, the title of the title of the power of the clearly, but they didn't want to be absolutely available rest of their own powerful restriction and methods.
You can learn about three interesting things.
First, and I think that's what I've been able to find out if the senates, whether the senates of the senates.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title of the title. He was just going to be senat active.
Secondly, you can learn to say that if a government, it was a government -- then you know, you know, you were 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title "President of the United States," is not so clearly not so that you don't do it?
It has a little bit more than 5,000 nuclears to do with the largest people who he's biggest people and the world and a physical drop of the world and a physical drop.
It's really given the title of the size of the size.
And so the senat in the end of the end.
They have a respectable title of title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of sense of the same thing.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to sound like the cling of the classrooms with the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the senat and the representation, and the representation, because no one is that you're going to be a whole thing that you're going to be the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take with, and with.
Politicians trying to use words to control the reality and the reality, but actually changing the reality of reality, but actually change the reality words of reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelling about 50 rebelling a 19-old, a 19-year-oldary surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I thousands of my black Converse half of a couple of course, and I couldn't even needed a rocket in the direction of governments that I couldn't even see.
This was the first time I was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
And I was a long time, I was a long time, I was biggest, all of the time, and I was ballp of slowings and football playing with rassistorates and fighting with rassistrates and religion-nationalistic distronic distronic distronic distronics and I
But that's the geography of self-infield.
And so I'm here, I'm here, citizens, Southeast Afghane, Southeist, atheist and atheist and atheist and atheist artist, the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do with the art of the things that you couldn't make a rainforest, but I want to make the personality, and I want to make the personality and cars.
I want to spend a day in life of a dihad -- Gangster who spend his districts like "Popstar Bling" appeared to the popular black and political corruption and political corruptions.
And what's the Dihad gangster, as a parlihad-time number country and a choice, and I'm going to make slogan: I'm going to make decide, and I'm going to make you rich."
And trying to use these campaign to detect these magnifically as national physical as national.
I want to take the corruption of the corruption of the basically called "Rast," and they called "Rast," which you're going to take a wrong control of the cabular construction of cabulars and cabulars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistanistanistanistanistan, I've become the "modic conflict.
The war and the free of approaches that were created with him, and they created a new environment, and models that you can only create a model of soldiers by single models and self-time college.
And I'd like to see how a simple scarreen, and I would like appelling of cabulation, and then we can create a dialogue today, today, and that the development of their designs in the colonial line of the colonial.
But for all of these things, you can get in prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be missing.
But I'm doing it because I have to be long, because the geography of self-long.
That's my last. What's your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I've been working as a model.
Since 10 years, right?
I've been able to see that in the room, and I've built a uncomfortable speech, because I wouldn't have to stopped this clothes.
And fortunately, I've got a way to change.
This is the first time that somebody on the TED stage on the TED stage, so you can see, so you can see.
If you really have a few women were really explored when I wasn't need to say that now, I don't need to say that I'm not to twitter.
I also think I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very shortly, because I can change in very short.
And it's not all the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear.
The hardest part is to pullover the pullover about my head, because then you're going to do all of you, you're all going to do with this, so long as it's nothing about my head.
In order to go.
Why did I do that?
It wasn't a person.
Now, it wasn't so personally like this image.
As a powerful, but a image, but a visible.
I've just changed your minds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photograph, I told my back and my back into my hand in my hair in the hair in the hair.
And then, from operations or the wrong bridge that I was two days ago, I've been working on two days ago, there's only very few possibilities, and our qualities, and our quite and our quite and our quite and unexpected -- although it's a big.
It's a terms of being to be honest.
And I'm standing on this stage, because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage, because I'm a hope, and I'm a woman, and we call this sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always asking me to the real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means," but that means.
The real reason why I was a model, is a certain metic lottery and a important maybe you're asking you, and perhaps this experience.
Now, in the last few century, we've been so beauty and young and young and young, and the biological consumption, but we're biological programmed, but also biological, and highly, and highly.
This experience was created for me. And it's a result of me.
I know there are people in the audience that are in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu. Liu. Liu. Liu.
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to be aware.
But unfortunately, I have told you that in 2007, a very at the year 2007, the NYU all the models on the walking on the running, every single one that was booked by 677, and that was booked by 67.7 or less than four percent.
The next question that I'm always been asked me, "Can I'm a model, if I'm a model?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls I want to girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be.
You can be presidentinated in the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a ninja-hander, which would be greatly irreg Dep, because then you're the first thing."
If they say, "No, I still say, "No, no, no, no, I want to say, "Who," I want to say, "Whole."
Because I have no responsibility and you couldn't be the carbon diague or the American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next sentence.
And you say that you want to be a model, you're going to say that you would say that you want to tell you that you want to win the lotto.
You can't confluence it, and it's not a career, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to give you 10 years, I want to take away from the constrating, because it can only be folding itself.
If there's a photograph, and you can see the light, and you can see a nice, and the customeron, and the cameron, and then we want to go to the legs, and then you go to the legs, and then you go to the poor, and then this arm, and then the poor, this arm, and then, and then, and then, and
It looks like this.
Hopefully more comic than that.
That was .... I don't know what happens.
If you're going to have a life, and you've done a few jobs, you can't be sorry, you can't be sorry, but if you want to be presidentin of the United States, "10 years," you're going to go to the United States.
The next question that I'm often asked me, "Who is retuse me?
And yes, so pretty much all the photos are just a little part of the story, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is the first photo, and that's what I didn't even have the first time I had a biciniode. I had no matter. I had not even my periode.
I know that's pretty personally, but I was a young girl.
So I saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me at the day, this shooting.
My friends had to stay with me.
This is me on a pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama.
This is me with the football team and in V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's construction, and it's construction of profession, from Hairlists and Make-up coasts and photographs and stylists and stylists and stylistent and the advance.
Okay, as next to the next thing, people are always saying, "We are you?"
Yes, I've got too many 20-cm-cm-cmaking, but the things I can't get to the things I'm going to get things I'm going to talk about, things I'm going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and I went to a day, and I had a launch of money, and you gave me the clothes.
As a teenager, I went to my friends with my friends, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and it took a "It needed, holding, and we could go on.
I've got this cost of my cost of my personality, and not because of my personality and there's people who don't know how to look at their personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were filter in the last year, and they were 85 percent swaren and latino and latino and latino, and most young men.
It's only 17,000 young,000 young, men, menal black and Latino, and Latinos, "Who I asked to ask, "Who I'm going to ask?"
But what is, "How often do I'm going to start? When I'm going to start?"
And I found my rights for this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of their body. And these numbers.
The last question is, "How is it, how is it, how is it?
And I think they're expect them, they expect, "If you're going to be a little bit of harm and longer harm, you feel very happy and felt very happy and fabelious and fabelious and fabeliously happy."
And Backstage, we're going to give answer that maybe this idea.
We say, "It's really great to receive so much to work with creative, and it's greative, inspired to work."
Everything that's just the half of half of half of the story, because what we never saw before the camera, which is, "I feel like, "I feel like, "I feel like, "I feel."
And I feel like I'm going to think about myself, because I have to think about my view.
And if I ask you ever ask, "What do I thin if I thin if I had thinner legs and longer legs?"
And then you should make a few mathels because they've got the thinest legs and the most finest legs and the most coolest coolest, and they're the coolest clamothes, and they're the most women on the planet.
When I didn't ready to ready to tell me, I'm very difficult to picture, because one of the fact that I felt very uncomfortable, and I felt like, "I'm going to be here, and I got to say, "I'm going to be a stacked to my generally.
It was very difficult to a very difficult, a result of university and race of opening, if I'm one of the biggest user.
But I'm happy, and I'm going to be here, and I'm going to be here, and I think it's great that I've been able to do it before 10 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 30 years, I wouldn't believe, because I wouldn't be like my career, I wouldn't believe my career.
If you take a little bit of this talk, then we all have the power of imagination in our imagination in our implications and failure.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten my grandmother, and I've never been come to the exility of life, "Son, list of Gaddafi Widafi Widdafi Widdafi.
But who never being a gaddafi-Revolutionary revolutionary."
It's almost two years, the liby research, the liby research revolution, inspired by the waves of the waves of the waves in the Egyptian revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, with a lot of other libyers and outside a day of the Zorns to start a day of the Zorns and to start a revolution to start a revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Now, liby women and men and men and men, in the first series, the first series of the regimes, hold slogans of the freedom, and social justice in the air.
They have an example, they've been used to use the brutal dictature Gaddafis.
They've shown sense of solidarity, from the most far from the most farmers, until the most farmers.
And finally, after a time of six months and almost 50,000 deades, and almost 50,000 deads, and we're going to stop the guyrants.
But Gaddafi has a big citizens, a great corruption and the guyrannei, and the reason for corruption and the reason for course.
Over four decades has gaddafis Tyrannic regime, and the infrastructure, and the moral structure of the lybic society.
The consciousness and the challenges, I realized how many other women, I as many other women, the civil society lybia, and we're going to report, and we're going to do with democracy and never against the same.
And so, in 200 organizations were during and unmed and unmediated in Benghazi.
After 33 years in exil, I got back to Lybia, and I started to Lybia, and I started to the subjection, I started to the subjection, human development, human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I found the peace of women, I women, a movement of women, leaderships, leaderships, and it's public life, it's public life, it's public.
And in the policies, I met a very difficult environment, a environment, a environment, and a environment, and a environment of the egoistic politics of Dominan and excited.
I just read a piece of peace and policies, and I'm going to be able to reach a lawyer, and to reach a laws, and it's a lawyer, no citizens, and to give the right and citizens and all the right and all the way to follow and all of the way to follow and allow
At the end of our initiative and successful.
Women women women's 175 percent of the National choice in the first choice.
But long, but the eye, the euphories and the whole revolution of election, and the whole day, we wake up to new new news.
A lot of morning, we wake up to the money to the money and Sufi-Grales and Sufi-Gres.
In another morning, we got news about the morning about the message of American message and the approach.
At the other morning of officiences of officients of the poor.
And really, we're going to grow up under the militize of military and their other people rights and their power and their power and their power and their power and their power.
Our society, information, in a revolutionary, polarized, polarized by the ideal and principles and principles, social Great, social Genits, social justice,
Intolerance, exclusion and roaches were revolution.
I'm not there today to inspired to inspired to successful story of our returns and the choice.
And I'm a lot of starting today is that we've been able to do as a nation that we've metric choice.
We've been set up our priorities.
Because the choice needs to have still stability or security or security in Lybia.
Hat the rule of the rivers and the way between female and men's female and national candidates and national values?
No, she didn't.
What is it?
Why is our society is going to be polarized and dominated by self-time politics of the dominance and the exclusion of men and the women?
Maybe the women were not the only one that has been the women, but the female characters of the middle of the middle of the inside.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensumption, and consumption, and the choice, the polarization and decision and decision and decision and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative requalitative requirement of the female, quantitative requires.
We need to stopping on the name of the name of the name of the roach.
We need to start to start to do with the name of the middle of the brain.
We need to develop a female discovered the following words that wouldn't just going to be able to do, but also to statts, collaboration, instead of collaboration, instead of approach.
These are the ideal that are the ideal of warrior of warrior, and it needs to reach peacebia to reach peace.
Because the peace has a alchemy and in this alchemy and in this alchemistry and masculines and machine.
This is the real register river.
And we need to do existence, before we do it before we do it before we do it.
After a transportation of the Coran "Salam" -- "istence the word of the barming God."
The word "head" again," that's all famously known as a tradition of Arabic Trabic characters like the word "mbolized the word "Moment," and symbolized feminally feminally, and the whole mankinds.
And just as the mother of the mother embryo, which is growing in him, completely the reason to the reason is the whole existence.
So this is why we said, "My gradually all of us."
So this is why we said, "My grade, my grandparence."
We all have been to be the gunning of the grades.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, I thought that the best of the world, and I wished "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we found the story of Kim Ilished the story of climate, but we learned to learn so much about the world, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea and Japanese.
Although I was often asked me how the outside often, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until to achieve.
And I saw years, I saw a public habitat, but I thought, but I thought, but I thought about normal.
My family was not poor, and I had to live myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter of a warrior of a collegin.
And you know, "If you're going to be here, we're going to be five family, because we've been for two weeks, because we've been for two weeks.
We're going to summarize and our body are soon as we're going to die."
I was so shocked.
I heard about the first time, I heard that people in my country.
And I went to the picture, I went to the terrible, and I didn't see something that I can't solve.
A live in a living woman, and a board, and a board child in their arm, and aid of his mother.
But nobody helped them because all of them, because all of these things were soon to care about itself and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big hungernot in North Korea.
At the end of north Koreaner's millions of the hunger of the victims, and many otherwise, and many otherwise, because they're just reason, colds.
In fact, it's always been more and more and more and more common sort of sort of side of China on the other side of China on the other side of China on the other side of the environment.
I always asked me why they had light lights, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighborhood.
This is the river of a microcccast, the part of the border between North Korea and China and China.
As you can see, the river, the riversity of the face of North Koreaners.
But many since.
Sometimes, I saw people in the river.
I can't say a lot about how I can't believe that I can say that I can say that I can say that I can tell you that I've been decided to China.
I thought I thought I was a short time from my family.
I never thought I'd never thought it's 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very difficult to live without family without family.
I had no idea of how life as a north Koreanese flying, but I would be involved. But I realized that it's not just extremely difficult, but also very difficult. Becorean flight. Becorean flights.
So I lived in a less fear that my realization could be able to fly identity, and you would be able to north Korea to North Korea.
One day, one day, my greater alptraum when I was bigger than I was brought from the Chinese police and in the police.
Somebody recently, North Koreaner, so they tested my chinese and asked my chinese and asked me to ask me.
I had this fear, I thought I thought I thought I would exploded.
Would be apparently unnatural, I could be sort of, I could be sort of approach.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I thought it, but I felt my feelings and answered the questions.
After they were asked to the excited, a moment, a false, "That was a round.
It's not North Korean."
And they were going to go. It was a wonderful.
Some North Koreaner in China in China in China in Chinese police, but many of the Chinese police and absolutely and absolutely.
These girls had girls.
Although they were expected, they were free, they were free, they were able to free international pressure.
These north Koreaner didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, every year, unique north Korean, and after North Korea, where they're followed, where they're going to be effective.
Although I had been lucky, I had a lot of other north Korean, it's not so.
It's tragic that North Koreaner's must be a hard to survive.
And then they learned a new language and working with work and working on a moment on the world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the hidden, I decided to go to South Korea, and I've been a new life.
Mich in South Korea never mattera, a bigger challenge, when I thought it was a bigger challenge.
English was in South Korea, I had to learn to learn to learn to learn.
And I've been a big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all the Koreaner, but inside ourselves, we've been able to do this, we're going to be part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the seven years.
Identity a identity crisis.
Bin Is South or North Koreaner?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
And then there was no country, there was no landscape that my home.
Although I was the anpassion of the south corean life, I had no easy.
I've been ready for the jobs of the university.
And so, as I was able to my new life, I got a hard life, I got a shock.
The North Korean Behind, the money that I was sending my family, and as a street, and as a street, and as a song place where I've been able to a country.
They had to fly as possible, so I started plane, so I began to plane.
North Koreaner has to be an incredible stripe to their way back to freedom.
It's almost impossible to over the border between North Korea, Ironically took a flight, Ironically made me back to China and made me back to the north Korean border.
Because my family, I had to slides, I had to suffering it, I had to southern China and then after Southeastasia.
The business is a week, and week, and we've been almost expecting.
Once, when the bus, a chinese police, a Chinese police.
He took the expanding of all, and he began to ask questions.
And I didn't understood my family, I thought they would be family.
When the Chinese bamed my family, I decided to stood and said that she would be decided to him, and I would be decided to be their attention.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, but happy.
We created it up to the laotic border, but I had to border, almost all of my money to borders of Laos.
But even after we had the borders had been reported, my family, because Illegal family.
After I had paid money, and short-taily, my family inside of a month, but I was repeated in the city, my family, my family.
This was one of the biggest back of my life.
I had done to family to family to family, and we were so close to the family, but my family, just my family.
I went down and I went to the insurance and the police and the police and trying to family, and I didn't have enough money, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man, "What's left?"
I was completely surprised that a friend of it.
In broken English and with a words, and I recorded my situation and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two other numbers and two other northern Korean, and two other northerns to get them out of prison.
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why do you?"
"I don't help you," he said.
"I'm help the North Korean people."
I realized that this is a symbolic moment in my life.
The remains of free-controlled free-bolized for me, and he took the North Korean, and he showed me the friends and he showed me the friends and the support of free and the international community as a hope.
And finally, after our long journey, my family, and I returned to the family, but the freedom.
Many north Koreaner's done by their families, and soon as they go to a new country, they start to start with little bit or not a money.
The international community can help us in the education, the Englishment, the education and many more.
We can also remain the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of us in contact with families, and we're staying information, and we send them information and money, and we're helping them to change north Korea.
I had a happiness, so much helping inspiration inspiration inspiration inspiration, I hopeful north Koreanernational northern United Stational success.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful north Korean on the world, and also on the world,
Thank you.
I've just a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit.
Please don't tell me that I'm not normal.
So I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very well, very well.
It can't speak, but he's communicated focus on a way that it couldn't have some of the best speech.
Remi white love is love.
It's participate it, and he's shared it.
It's not a skin. He's not on the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences and imagine, and you're never telling you never tell a light.
If he songs from our childhood, when he's trying to remember that I don't even remember one thing: how little we know about the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the unknown.
Samuel is 16th. He's a very good. It's very good.
He's a absolutely uncomfortable memory.
But he also has a selective.
It can't remember if he's got my chocolate written, but he remembers, but he reminded on my iPod, and he was conversation that we had a fourth, as four, as four, as four of all of the most fourth of all of the bottom of the bottom of all of the bottom of
Do they don't hear about it?
But many people are not true.
And in fact, because their understood, because their scientific version of normal version of normal, they're often understood.
But what my heart, and my heart, and my soul, and my soul, even though this was the case, even though they were not as a case, even though they were just a certainly autism that they were extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not solidly not so clear with the confusion of the brain, it's a complex faction of the brain, which is a complex function of the brains that learning and sometimes learning.
It's extremely differently, in every individual, it's a different than Sam.
And global warming all 20 minutes in a new person autism, and even though there's one of the most fastest growing developments of the world, there's no known as a hold cause of the world, or hold or health or healing or healing or health.
And I can't remember the first time I remember the autism, but I can't remember, but I can't remember it.
I was born three years old, when my brother than my brother, and I was so on, and I was so on.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and in fact, and actually not very interested in me.
Remi, and regulated in his own world, and he was regular world, and he found found found founds, and he found things like about how about the smallest things that are in a series that are in the room, and all of it, and all of it.
And as he was older, he was different, and the differences, and the difference.
But the wutances and the frustrate and the frust and the neverage hyperactivity was something really unique: a religious nature, a junk of nature, a junk of the world without the world without the world, a human beings who had never been.
And also, extraordinary.
Now, I can't learn that there were some family in my family in my family, moments that I wish I wished that I would be exactly as I wished.
But I'm going to learn to the things that they've taught me to the things that they're going to be considuality, and I understand that these things I wouldn't want to understand that these things I wouldn't want to thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands
Normality, the beauty that the beauty that differences are different, and the fact that we're not that we're not that one of us.
It means that there's another way of the right.
And if I could just say one thing to Remi, and then you couldn't be normal, it wouldn't be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have a gift of us, and we have a gift of us. And in all the ears, and in all the early, the striving victims of potential.
The chance on size, running and change in the moment where we try to be trying to be trying to be.
Please -- don't say that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has a project, and curiosity, and curiosity with this photo on the photo on the apple, and with a million seconds of just a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million times faster and see the world, but a million pictures a million pictures per second.
I'm going to ask you a new way of photography that female photography, a new device that they can make time, which is so quickly that they can make time in the movement of light in movement.
And so we can build cameras, we can look at the absolutely, and we can look at each other, or without a beautiful in our body, and really in our body, and really in question, and really in question.
If I'm going to take a laser painting and him in a certain million seconds -- that's more female, and I'm going to create a photon, I'm a photon, and this photon, and this photon.
So if you take this projectil, this photon, and it's in these flaps, and it's going to be in these photones in the rivers in the rivers?
What's the lights in time?
So this whole eventually eventually.
So, think about it, the whole eventually, the whole eventually less than a nanoseconds -- so long as a nanosecond to the light, but I'm long, but I'm going to see this video to the factor of this video.
No, Coca-Cola has not financial.
So in this movie, so much, so let me show you what happens to show you what happens.
The puls, our projectil, our projects in the flap, and a photonpaket, and that starts to move and that's starting to move.
A part of the lights outside the an outside of the table, and you see these exercise.
Many of the photones of the photones of the last last, and exploding the rivers and exploding directions.
As you can see, there's a called air, which is in the rivers.
As after the waves are the waves on the table of the table of the reflexions of the reflexions of the rivers on the end of the rivers.
If you take a single project, and it's the same stripe, and the video and the video and the video, and you know, how long you know how long you have to see how long you have to see how long you have to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a week.
It would be a very long film -- from a slow film -- from a slow projectil in movement.
And how does it look like a still life with something still?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the walls in the background.
It's like you're a sentence.
I think it's like this, as if the nature of nature, the nature of a photo match, but of course, but of course, but of course, our eyes.
But if you look at this domate, you'll see that, you will see that if the lights, you will remain the tomate, this is not going to be disturbing. It's not going to be dark.
Why is this? Because the tomate, and the light and the light and the lights and after a few seconds.
So in the future, if these female camera in your camera in your camera in your camera, it could be able to make a supermarket, and you can go to a fruit of whether it's a fruit.
So how did my team at MIT these camera?
So as a photograph, if you're going to make a photo with course, you have a very little light, but we've got a billion light, but we're going to get a billion times faster than your light.
So we're doing this project, we send this projectil, this photonism and we're going to show you that package, and then we're going to combinate this gigabytes of data, and we're recognize these female.
And we can take all these rows and make things and doing things.
So, superman can fly.
Other hands can make us feel like we can do with a new superhery for a new superhery for a future surgery?
The idea is that we're going to create something light.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it, a part of it, and then reflecting the door, and we could reflect these more simplicated, and we could use these more simplifying.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built it.
On the left of our femto camera.
And here's a puppeared, and we're going to be able to represent the door.
After our after our application in the Nature Communication, it was published by nature.communication.communication.
We're going to take these lights, and they're going to get to this wall, and they're going to be able to get in all directions, and some of the photones are going to be able to reach ourselves, and then we're going to reach the light.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our female camera has some single camera.
It has a very good time, and it can look at the world in light, and it can look at the world.
And of course, we know, we know, but we're also hidden the hidden objects, but we don't know what we don't know what we don't know what the distance.
If we looked at a laser on the slight, we can see a row, we can see that -- how they can see on the screen, but if we look at the screen, but if we look at the pictures of these images, and they try together and try together and try together and try together and try together, and try and
Can we see it in 3DD?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit about the lab, we can use the practice, we can use the practice, we can use the collisions, and we can see what's going to see, or we can see in the curve, or we can see in dangerous lights.
But because of the blood and tissue is that, of course, it's why this is really a way to think about female, so that's why we can think about female, and now, because a new conference, because a new confusion of the next generation of medical education.
So, as well as a scientists, even a scientist, and we can have a scientists, and we can't be a art of the ultra-scale photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes that we're going to be able to do with the scientific education.
But it's happening here,
If you look at these waves in the rivers, you see that the waves of us, you can see that the waves of us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens?
It turned out that we've been able to take away in light, and we've seen, and one of the effects and incredibly incredibly incredibly.
The rest of the rest of the event in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world in the world, so they can relate the rest of the camera by space and time, we can use these connection of space and time, we can correct this connection.
So, even as a photography to photography or the exploration of a new design of a new data, and we've been able to requirements, we all have to help us all the data and data and datails often.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of opportunities, how our middle of our lives.
We don't make any neighborhood, so that many ways, so that many ways, but we're using the same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share with my neighbors and shared things like a bit of things like tasks and crosss and circuits.
The projects of my questions, how much mine my questions like many masters?
How can we listen to more things without us to stop us?
How can we teach our memories to share our memories and the country and the country?
And how can we share our hopes for affordable houses, so that our communities, our needs our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea levels of the giant efforts of hundreds that are hundreds of years, beds, beds and dreams, and I've been abuse. I've always missing music.
I think every time, every time, every time, there's no one parade, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings, but it's also the city of the world, but it's also the city of America.
If I'm going to be able to do this house, and I thought it's beautiful. And I thought about something that I thought I'd changed my life for always changed.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother, and she was like a mother, and she was suddenly and unexpected.
I thought about death, and I thought, and I spent a big disorder for my life, and it took me to my life, and I brought about the things that are important.
But it's hard to me, this is a hard to make this point.
It's easy to lose and lose together and to forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends of the lower of the house of the house, and I wrote a huge tail, "Bevorite, I want to be a piece, I want to be a piece. Everyone. Everyone, I can take a piece of a piece.
I wasn't sure what I could experiment, but I could expect, but I was the next day, the wall, and they were always been filling, and they're going to kep it.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the walls that were written by the wall.
"Bevor I'd like to be away, I want to be away."
"Bevor I'd like to stand up, I want to stand up the International datums."
"Bevor I'd like to sing for millions of people."
"Bevor I'd like to send a tree, I want to plant a tree."
"Bevor I'd like to live "netzune,"
"Bevor I'd like to kep it once, I want to kep it."
"Bevor I'd like to be a cavallery cavallery."
"Bevor I'd like to be myself."
This is after place that was a sense place, and the hopefull place and dreams of people, and the hope of people, and the wine, and the wine, and wearing me as the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and between a new way of undergrounding way.
It's about place, place for meaning and reminds to remember what we're going to remember what we're grow up and change us.
I've done this last year, and I've made hundreds of economic people who wanted to build a wall, and I wanted to build a colleagues, and I've been built in countries like artists, and now, and now, as artists like art.
We've shown how much power our power powerful places have the opportunity to share our voices.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time, and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever, the things with the right views of the right blend of the right blend of life, and it's lives.
We're often recognize the death to talk about death or just thinking about death, but I've realized that the an advance on the death is one of the death is one of the death.
The thought of the death, the death,
Our common samples of places that are important to share what we can help us as a community. And with more possibilities, and with more possibilities, and stories, and stories, and they can help us to help us to help us to help us better places to help us better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm appropriate mathematics. One issue for everyone who are in particular problem for everyone who are confused mathematics.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to explain the trying to explain today.
And the most human activities is one of the most activities.
We're crazy of mostly in most of most of most found ballett-time, like you're going to see how you're going to see how you're going to see.
At the ballettle of a very extraordinary ballets, and abilities, and abilities, and ability to have a genetic eventually a genetic component.
Traurdually, destroy neurological structural capacity like Parkinson, and it makes them to my recognize, and that makes its time, who was a ballettuis.
And over the years, you've made a lot of research in the treatment.
But yet, there's a worldwide 6.3 million people who are living in this disease, and they need to live with the unconscious symptoms like symptoms, sectors, and more living.
We need to measure the projective message, and we can measure, and finally, and we can actually have a single possibility, if we have a objective massive massive mass.
<unk>romy is that there's no biombson and other movements don't have a biomarker, so you can't just leaders. The best thing. The best thing. It's this 20 minutes.
You have to do it in clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very expensive studies, and that's not going to never get that never.
But what if patients would be able to do this test?
That would be a difficult tour in the hospital tour in hospital. What if patients could make this test?
It wouldn't be a teures hospital hospital.
It costs 300 percent, 300 percent, in neurological action in neurological action.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods that we're trying to reach that we're all trying to reach, because we're all trying to recognize virtuote.
So here's a video of video of video.
It's happening in the health condition, if someone speaking. We can look at us as a stimular ballets, because we have to coordinate all of these voice, and we have to coordinate the gene, and we all have the gene.
And as ballet, it's enormous.
Think about how long a child, as long as a child, until it's a child.
And by the skin, we can certain vibrate vibrate vibrate stimulus, and as the morgane of parkinson.
On the bottom of the insurance, you can see an example of voice, you can see.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
It's awaker, switch, security.
The language is actually afford to the time, and that's an example, and that's an example of it.
These effects on the voice, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, but with digital microphone and presence of the digitalysisms of the media, combined with new lessons, and we can do with new learning.
How can they measure these tests with clinical message? Well, they're not both invasive. The test.
It's just a little bit. The infrastructure is already.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. It's not going to be the voice.
So you can be reading themselves.
They're very quickly, you're maximum.
They're very cheap and we know what that means.
If something extremely billig, you can use it in great big scale.
These amazing goals with this.
We can reduce logistic difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to leaders in clinics in clinics.
We can relate objective data by highly observation.
We can go to the current massive massive studies for clinical studies and first, and first of all the population of the whole population of the population.
We've got the possibility to look for Biomarkers for the disease, before it's too late.
Today, we're going to do this direction, we start to start the parkinson's simming.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of voices to voices to voices to start enough to bring enough to the rich.
We have a robots that are dreaming a billion people on this planets are on this planet.
Everyone, or without parkinson, you can go to the process of a couple of center to go to a few center. I give you a few center, I've already have been ready in just eight hours percent of our goal.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people, you can say 10,000 people say, who isn't you say, who isn't it?
What are you going to do with all these problems?
What happens is that the patients have to advance to patients, whether these person on parkinson't. OK.
Some people don't get to the end of the end.
But we collect a huge database, underesting, underesting, which is interesting. These are important, because we're important, because we're important to figure out what the real marker for parkins.
At the time, you know, their 86 percent.
It's much better.
My students -- I have to love him, because he's so fantastic worked so fantastic work -- has now been shown to the mobile phone works on the mobile phone works, and we're going to work on, and we're going to be able to do with 9 percent.
I call this a connection.
That means that people can do -- people can do with the handy on the handy, and people could do with parkinson, and people could take their voice, so that their voice, so that you can take the research.
That's what you're doing.
Thank you. Max Let me, my dad, my dad.
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenya, I live in Kenyairobi national parks.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the cows is the nairobi national park.
The Nairobi national park is just imagine in the southern Earth. It means that wildlife, that wildlife, like cebrazy.
The runs that are the solutions, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cows that were killed. I thought I was wake up and I thought it was dead. It was horrible. It was our only box.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we think we're collaps with our animals and the way we came from the sky.
I learned to eat solutions.
Our warrior warriorans. They're going to protect our stamm and our hearts. They're also brought on this problem.
and killed the solutions.
Here's one of six solutions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's something about it in the Nairobi national parks.
In my stamm is a boy between six and nine years, and nine years, and nine years.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Feuer. Lions for me.
But then I realized that this wouldn't help us see the solution, but the cows, the cows.
But I didn't go. I didn't go.
I had a second idea. I tried to a bird.
I wanted to think the solutions, I thought I was standing.
But solutions are very clearly animals.
You can see the birds, and you go back. Beime, and they go back. It's going to go and say, yes, and they're still not, that's still not, that's still there.
And they're going to kill our viety.
One night, I thought, I went to the case. I love the hand around him and this time, and this time, and that's not.
So it's a light that lights for light.
I had an idea.
And as a small boy, I worked the whole day in my room and took the new room and took my mother radio of my mother. And I had took me a lot about electronics. But I had learned to learned me.
I took a old car, and I'm going to show a direction of a motorcycle. The right, whether you want to left. He just wants to left.
And I was a switch to me, to switch the lights.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a caps.
And then I built all of this.
The solar panels are the battery that battery, the battery, the battery. I call it a transformator.
And the directionanzee.
You see that the births after the birth, because of the solutions.
And this is what it looks like this, if they come to the solution.
The lights are blinking and the solution, I think I was about the stall. And I was about the stall.
Thank you.
I've been installed installed and since we had no problems.
And then our neighborhood.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and they asked me to ask me if I could ask my lights installing their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed in the lights. They can see the solution.
Since I've seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good.
My idea is now used to be used to be able to use for other robots like hyes or leopards like hyes. The lights. The lights of farms.
My invention, I think, a stipal school, a stip of the best schools in Kenyse, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really excited.
My new school engaged and helps and helps and helps and recording.
I even brought my friends with my friends and common and we're going to be able to do the lights where you don't use them.
A year ago, I just a boy from the Savanne, who was hits. I saw a year. I saw myself, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a sitting in a sitting!"
And here I'm going to stand up here.
I thought with a plane, I was at the first TEDTalk.
If I'm a big, I want to be airplane. It's my great dream.
I've got a solution. But I can save the cows, I can save the cows of my father, and we can save the solution, and we can live without the side, without the solution, without strip.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I'm going to thank you.
You know, you know, you know, how to hear how to hear a story like your story.
So you've got this stipendium. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next to the list?
My next invention, I'm working on a electrical functrical functroza. One electroza?
Yes, I know, electrical cities are already have been invented, but I want to have my own.
You've been trying to get it, not trying to kep -- yes, I tried to give you away, but the trying to give you a slap.
All the beginning is hard Turere, you're a little bit of a bit like this.
We're going to be you in every step in every step, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm since old enough to hold a camera in the hand, photography. But today, but today, I want to share with you, and I've done with you.
There was no kind of director, no piece, no chance, no chance, no chance. Not even the painting.
In fact, mostly, mostly, mostly, mostly, mostly commonly,
My story begins as I started to a talk to a talk about a talk in New York, and my wife, and my daughter, and I was birthday on my arm. We were on my arm.
And so we were able to go back to New York and so we decided to same picture.
Well, you can see what you can see is.
When the third birthday, my daughter, my wife, "Hey, why don't you sabina, and she doesn't make it a father-Re.
And then we started to make a picture of tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, as universal, as universal free of his camera.
Nobody has never said, no one has never been lucky, and there's no one with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these rice would change our lives.
This journey is very hold.
This is just after the 111. September 11th, and I had to explain what happens in the day, and I had to understand what it's going on.
These images are much more than just a far more than just a moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a way to stop a week of a week, and as weeks and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical, not just physical.
Because we're always doing the same image of miles, our perspective of Mal. While they're always new miles, I think it's always seeing it with their eyes, and how they see it.
These are very intensive time that we spended with each year, and every year we're expecting and each year.
Last, as a sudden, as one of our rice, we went to the rice, and we're going to be as a sudden, she shows it as a puppet on a pupples in a pupples, in a pupples, in fruits.
And she told me about their feelings that she had five years as a five-year-old on the same of these sort of same.
She said they remember how their hearts to remind the heart of the breast time she saw the first time she saw the first time.
And now they looked in New York, because they want to study because they want to study in New York.
And I was created, the most important thing we're all creating, memories.
And so I want to share with you to share the idea of aware of memories in the most important memories.
I don't know how it looks like it, but I'm going to see from these 15 images, I'm on a family.
I'm always doing the image.
I want to get every of you today, and I want to get to ask you to ask you to ask you, "Would you do not do you want to do a picture of us?"
Thank you.
