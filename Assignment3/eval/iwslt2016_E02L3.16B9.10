So when I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clear freedom.
My father hearing on his little bit, grades, the new Radio the bBC.
He looked very happy, very happy, very importantly, very until well, because most of them, most of them, most of the news.
He's called "The Taliban.
I didn't know what that means that means, but it's very happy.
"You can go to a huge," he said," he said,"
The morning I'm going to be a morning.
A remarkable school.
The Taliban, the power in Afghanistan, and I was six, and I was able to go to school, and I was able to go to school.
So I'm sustainable, I five years, and I started as a junk of my oldest sister, and I didn't go out of your swimming, and you're going to be a slime.
And so, we could go to school, we walked to school.
Each day, we're going to take a different way, even though we could never do that, where we went to where we went.
We were able to make our books in the left, so we could go out of the book, as if we're just looking like this.
We were able to tell you about 100 births, over 100 birds in a little wall.
In the winter was incredible, but in the summer, it was incredible.
We all knew that we were allowed our lives: teachers, teachers, and our parents.
In the important, the important for a weeks for a weeks, because the Taliban being a week.
We were never been using to be sure how much they knew.
Do you know, they do?
Who did they know where we're going to do?
We had afraid, but we wanted to school, but we wanted to school.
I had a big happiness in a family, in a family and translated as important and taken.
My grandfather was his time.
At the eyes of a decide of a finanistan. He was remember, he was invinced, my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- and he was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to school.
My mother was borning mother, but it was teacher.
This is it.
Two years ago, they went to the ruhest of our house, and women in a school and women from the news.
And my father -- here was the first time -- the first in his family, which was a slide.
And for him, it was sound that his children, it would be a experience, it would be a sustainable, but also his drots, it's done all the risk.
He looked like a lot larger risk of the risk, it's not to school.
I know that I know that I'm going to be in the Taliban, sometimes even so early, and the state of our lives and the perspective and the perspective.
I've been talking about, but I was listening, "Thather, you can hear me. You can hear everything can be lose everything.
And your money can be done. You can be in the war. You can be in war.
But a thing that's going to be a thing: That's going to be here, and even when we're going to be able to make our blood for your bubble, we need to do this.
So -- you want to still you still up?
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country on a country that was destroyed by war.
Well, when the women's been age of my alters have a higher than the seconds, and when my family. And when my family, and when my family for my family.
Instead of the middle of the time, when states of the Middlebury College.
So when I was afghanistan, I was my grandfather, the family, the family, because he was because he was because he was him, because he was sending to school, a bad, one of the first bad of the first large.
He didn't just practice with my high school, but also I was so that I was so that I was that I was, and I'm, and I'm snowed by cabulating the cabularly five-time.
My family believe me.
I have a great trick, but my family has been stilling greatest transmit for me.
So I'm a global both of the global both a women, a women.
So I've been able to make SOLAOLAOLA, and maybe some Internative in the Internative, a country, a country, in the country, in the school,
It's wonderful to see how the schools, like the school with great earning chances, all of them all of them, all of them.
And to see how their parents and vaccinating, like this, like this, and I mean, and I decided to me, and everything, and everything.
So as Ahmed. That's not being a really name, and I can't show you, but Ahmed, but Ahmed.
It's a months were his daughter and heimbing on the home of SOLA in their village and they're going through a bombs, and they're only getting a little minutes.
And when he was home, he came up, and he was sounded the telephone, and a voice, he was going to be fall, they would be try to school.
And he said, "Thead me, I want to say, but I'm going to be the future, but I'm going to play the future of my daughters and talking about the oldest predictions."
What Afghanistan, so I've been able to do something that I've been able to be opened, most often the most of us, most of us, the results that's a father, and he's a father, and it's also being a father.
That's not today that our mothers don't have a little role of our experience.
And then they're hard to holds that are able to make a lot of them, and a lot of their distributions, and you know, you know, and you're going to be in a society like the in a society of the men.
The Taliban, just went to the talible hundreds of millions -- because it was yes, because it was yes.
But today, everyone in Afghanistan, three million million million million million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The American, like us, like us, like us.
If I didn't changed by the change and nothing with the Abancing the U.S.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I'm soulines in my parents, and their parents that they're going to make a lot of them, and then they see a lot of future, and then I see a lot of future and a lot of wall.
Afghanistan is for me, and the hope and the hope and the impossibility, and it remembers, and every days, and the SOLAOLA.
And so I think they have a big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do something that I do, also, I was -- my life -- my life -- they were in Africa, as young man.
In 1971, in 197, I see somebody, but I don't -- I don't -- I don't have in Sambia, Kenya, algories and Somalia, and Somalia projects of the technology.
I've been working for a 2RO, and every single project, and every single project that we're going to be the boys.
I was able to make it.
I thought, 21 years, we thought well, and good people are good people in Africa,
Instead often, we were all sort of what we did.
We first project, which is my first project, which is my first book, which was a camorner, which was a cambian, which we wanted to see people who wanted to see people, like nutrition.
We came with analia, we came in South America, in South America. We're going to make the Sambia. We're leading the sambia. We're going to be a services and talms of the talms of Talyci.
Of course, the answer wasn't a interesting, so we don't have an interesting, so well, and sometimes they were doing it.
We were able to do that there was so early in a soon early different talent.
But instead of wonderful, why they were nothing, we just said, "God, we're just here.
"Gerade it's right now to retire people to retroduce the prediction."
Of course, all of the wonderful.
We had this practice, we had been so big, they were so big, they were so big,
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Skin," and we said, "Theadwirt."
As the domata, and it was about 200 nights, about 200 nights and wonderful.
We said, "Oh God, God, God, the nilp of God.
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a country."
"Why didn't you know, why don't you're never taken us."
I thought we were so good, we were so good in Africa, but then I saw what the Africa, but then I saw what the Englands, which is what the fragile, which is what they did, which I was doing.
We filled the nilms of the nilm.
They should see the unfortunately -- you're seeing the uncomfortable African people,
They should be the book Aiddlead Aidida," is a sambis Moyo Lin.
The book was 2009,
We have available confrican confrontinent 1,5 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been in the money.
So let's just simple.
Last you're going to have a African,
We're investiguously imperating, colonialists, and there's only two species, and we're patrize them or we're patrize them or we're patrize them or we're patrixic.
Wide World Worlder, the latines," which means "Thather"
But they have two different kinds of different meanings.
Patriarchalic: I'm going to be a different culture, as a different culture. "I love me.
Patronized: I'm going to treat everyone a different culture, as if they were my drawing my drawing.
So this is why people are going to be in Africa,"
I was after I was after I was the book, "Small," of school," he said, "That's all over the economy, if people don't want to be able to left them in the room.
This is the first principle of the hilt.
The first principle of the hilt is Respect.
Today, the hundreds of the herributes that conference, and I asked a stability and asking you, "Can you're going to be a city?
So when I was 27 years old, I was going to reaction, and I'm going to reaction, and I'm going to be a system that you never have ever been initially in the person, you're going to be a little body, but you're going to be the personalists of the pion, the pion of the possible.
What you do -- you do -- you're half.
You never do never have a common with ideas, you're sure you can do with the skills.
We don't work from broad.
We make us in Caf<unk>s. We do that. We do in Caf.
We don't have infrastructure.
We fly found friends and find out what the person's going to find out what the person.
The most important is the level of the people.
You can make somebody each other idea of a idea.
If this person that you should do?
The page of the personal growth of the person is important.
The passion for the own growth is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find that science, because it can never be able to be able to be afford.
The person with the idea of idea, but it's not the science, but it's not the science.
A lot of years ago, I had this instattent in a community, and people say, and people who are doing, and people who hear them? But why they're not going to hear about it? But not in community.
Let me show you a secreting a secret.
There's a problem with community.
And I never have been part of them, and they're never going to say what they're going to say about their money, what they want to see what they want to see.
Plancy has this blind this blind.
The clearly people who don't know, because they don't know because they don't know because they never explore.
We're working a single to do this, to do this, a social infrastructure that are not existed.
A new box is going to be a new box.
This is the house of the companies of the company of the bedroads, which is the house, and you're going to find your couch, and in the caful and in the caful, your life, your life, your life, your life.
I have this in the four-Australia, trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to tr
I'm going to get to the time and trying to the time, and I tried to make other things that we should do what they do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had to help used to help me, and I was half of my first customers, and I was him. He was him. He was Moriana. I him, and I him, and I was himself in Panthancances.
I half of this 5 fish, and I'm going to help us to work with this wonderful, and I don't helped to make a faby for 60 percent of the Sushiane, but for 15 percent of the Sushian.
In a year, I had two percent of the government. The government, "How do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I'm really doing something very, very, very swimply.
I half the mouth and high school."
So -- so -- so -- so, "Mach you say, "Mach it."
We've been able to do it in 300 community.
We have 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are using to make a new generation.
Peter Drucker, one of the best companies, a few years ago.
Peter Drucker was Philosophy, including, in company, and Peter Drucker Drucker: Peter Drucker's really indeed, in fact, and the increasing society."
Plancy is the Todescuss of the company.
So you know, you know, without christs without know what the crime, and their money without their money and their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to make this.
You have to tell them Disk and Privacy and Privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them, and they're going to help them.
In a common with 10,000 people get two hundreds of 10,000 people.
Can you can imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the people?
So for what the presentation is the most of you have the most of the most morning?
<unk>romous, embracy people. They have applications.
I want to say that company, I want to say that company.
We're in the end of the first industry -- we're going to be able to fossil fossil fossily, and it's systems, and it's systems, and there's not systems,
The relationship is not after is not after.
The Freon-Aron-Aron-time is not after.
We have to look at what we need to make them millions of people on after people on a sustainable way today, transportation, transportation and with them.
The technologies don't exists.
Who is going to be the biggest revolution? Universities? Compities?
The government? Do you're going to be.
It's going to be able to do it. And they're going to do it.
I'm going to make a future story in a future of years ago.
There was a group of experts that were in the future of experts of New York in the city of New York in the 1860.
In 1860 years, they were in 100 years, and speculated in 100 years with the city of New York. The City. The city: The City: The City: The New York,
Why? You looked at the curve and said, and said, when the population in this tempoint in this tempoint, they need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be fixed by the million possolutely
because they went on the mistakes in the mistak.
1860, they see the hard technology that life looks like life.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001, there were 1001, 1001.
The idea, one of the other technology, the running. It was a little bit of small fabrics in the country.
And then, Michigan. Henry Ford. Henry Ford.
There's a secrets to work with companies.
And when he had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
And they didn't come and talk about you.
So when you have to tell them, you have to turn them out, and they're service boys.
Then you have to tell them the most truth is truth.
From the small firmade of the small company, three things from the laboratory: That's got to make a product. It has to be able to be able to behavio, and his financial and his financial and his financial.
Rather you do?
We never have a few person who have a same time that you can make a little person, and we can make a produce the money can make the money.
So something that's not existed.
This person was never been born.
We've been able to do this, and we've been able to do this, the world, Carnegy, Westing, Westing, Edonics, Fordon, Fordon, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google,
There's only one thing that allowed allowed firms of the world, just a community, just a person of a person.
Now, we're going to be 16-year-old country, and we started to start the first time, and we started to be in the first two side of Richard Bran, and the first two side of Richard Bran. The first one of the first time, and the first time,
Nobody, "There" and 32 mal."
He wasn't all he started.
Nobody's green a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So we can make a community, in the average, which is a little bit of the Internet, in Caf, in Caf<unk>s" and Bars, and bars, and you're going to do what they're going to do what you do?
What can you make it? Can you?
Okay, you can make it? Can you can you make it on the money?
"Oh, no, no, I can't you." "Mo young?
We have community community.
We've given groups that are going to be able to help the companies that are going to help them to help them out of the middle of the middle of the wonderful intelligence of the intelligence.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I have to be able to be where it has to be in the wonderful.
The penn State University, a Docent, a Docent in communications -- increasingly increasingly in communications.
I had angry --
It's not an artist. Astriction with their great brains and their great books and their great books, and their books, and they don't understand me.
But as the face of the face that he was small, it was like alice, as a nice, as a nine, and a coin and a whole new world.
I felt like, I felt like I was in faces with the students, and I was felting about the thought about the thought they wanted to do that other words, and I wanted to decided that other words.
I think that day to public to public communications.
We need to make a great communications of our scientists and in our scientists and innovation.
Because our scientists and innocent, and including our bigger problems, like our memory, like, and when we don't understanding and when we don't understanding it. I don't think about it. I don't think about our scientists.
But this great conversation, if we don't come to our scientists and innoved us in their wonderful.
So scientists and innocent, bit of us, clear.
I want to show you a few ants of how you can see that we can see that we can see that we can see that the science and the technology, and the technology, and they're going to talk about it.
The first question that you're going to have to be, is, is, and?
Saytay, why we're actually sure of scientific scientific biod.
Saybe not only that you don't just small, but also says, but also says that you can also make us that you can actually make us in our covers, because they can actually under our covers, because they're important, and they can understand the most important,
And when you're going to make what you do, then you're going to make sorry.
Afterwards are a hindows are a certainty.
Sure, you couldn't be used and pretty much, but why you don't just say, "Raum and time you don't understand what is much, and time?
We're really understanding of course, is not the same as you're not the same as their nive.
As astein bits said, "Machachach things like this, but not just like this.
You could make us a little bit about something about eual scientific scientifically, without the compromises, without compromising.
A few things are things that are going to be crazy: examples, stories, and analogies, and analogies, you could make them in your banned.
And when you're working present, then you're going to make the story.
Habt you ever asked young wondering why it's called "That's called?
What happens when somebody else? As anyone else, and with this point, and with this point of their own place.
A following this is not just a long time, but also too very slowly too very small part of our brains and you're going to be faster.
These example, the great of Genevieve Brown Brown, you show you that the special structure of the special structure of the trees of the inspiration for some of the inspiration for some of the inspiration of the inspiration.
The trick here is a single thing to use a simple simple sentence, in the audience, when it's audience, organization, or so that you can use the pictures and Graphics and Graphics and our smallery.
These are just a few answer that we can help us to help us to see this animals and the wonderful and the science and the technology and the technology and the technology.
And so, the innocent that I've been talking about me, I've been talking about the <unk>Nerd in me, I want to make all the same way together with a same way together with a same way.
So this is a science of eurricity, and you're instants, and you're expectations, so that's really important, so that's important, and that's important, and that's important to the economy, and incredible.
So scientists and innocent, when you're including this same thing, you know, it's inevited me.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a hand, you can make a cell phone in Syria.
With a cell phone can make a news and a protesta work in <unk>gype.
And with a cell phone can take a song, it's highly highly highly.
All of that's possible.
I'm a year in 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the time in this city.
There's a hundreds of thousands of people for change the streets and the streets and the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989 and in 1989 and we're all these people who had been in the countries, and change a handy in the tasky in the task.
Who is a hand, a handy of that?
They half you high.
You're high school, you high, you high!
And then you're high. As other word, a blackberry,
These are many fast everyone has a home.
But now, and I want to talk about me and my hands and my life, like my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 350-830 cells of information.
Rohdata.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006, the Eur.
These runny is called Right, the retroducation.
These runny, every particular particular cells, every particular in Europe, every single Internet in the entire europe, a bandbreaker information.
Who is it? Who do you go to a public action?
Who do you know, a smart?
And when you're using a hand, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months, or two years of your parts of your telephone or your Internetan or your Internetanet.
And overall in Europe are the people ones and said, "That's not want to say, "That's not want to do."
They said, we want to do this imagination,
We want to be able to make selful in the digital and we don't want to be the telephone and Internet and Internet and Internet, all of us, all of us, all of us information.
There were approaches, Journalists, Pree, Pree, all of the parry, we don't want to say, "That's not want to say, "That's not want to say, "That's not going to say, "That't want to say, "That's."
And here you can see how conditions are people on the streets of blinds, and says, "Free, "Free, "Freece."
And some of them, you could be such a state of 2.0.
The state was the massive of the massive in Ostants.
And I asked me, whether it really works.
Can you really want to do all of these information?
Each time I use my hand?
So I asked my particular society, the Deutchomous telecomy that was the larger part of the larger particularly in the Dever, and I wonderful, and I was asking them all information,
And I asked them away, and I asked them and they didn't get a right answer. Nural bubble.
But then I want to say that information, because it's my life, because it's my life.
So I decided to make a great thing to do is a greater, because I wanted to make this information.
But the drawing telecom said, we're going to be you, we're going to be you.
At the end of it, it was to a construction.
I'm going to go back to the ancients, where they all sended to me.
Because in the currently, the boundaries that the bound that the emotion of the emotion of the emotion of the emotion.
So I'm going to have this half-claging environment.
And on the CD.
Three.830 cells information.
And then I was looking at me, and I said, it's half a half a half. Metweet.
But then I realized a way, I was my life.
These are six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit of skeptic, what should I do with this?
Because you see where I'm here, where I'm going to make what I do.
But then I want to go to this information with this information information.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show you what I want to show you what I want to make the means.
So with the time, without the open Data City, so I've been here.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can remember and you can remooms, you can return back and back.
You can make every single step, because I do any singleep.
And you can see, as I can see from Frankfurting the curiously, and how many fears, and how many anti-call.
And that's possible to this information.
This is a little bit of an art.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all.
And it's just like this, I'm going to go out and they talked about me, and we talked about a few malaar Malaar Mala Mala Malaar Malaar Malaar Malaar Malaar Malaar Mala.
And then I'm going to make a few friends and they go up away.
And after a while you're going to go out and you've got this huge communications.
But you can see how people can see how people communicate to what they're going to go to the time they go to bed away from the bed.
And you can see all of you see.
You know, you know, you know, you know, about the figure, about the leaders are the groups.
If you can see the information, you can see what you can see what the society.
If you can make a curious, you can make the society.
This is a bubble for countries like China and the Iran.
This is the perfect defined definitional economy, because you can talk about a society, who knows, who you know, you know, you know, everything that's possible, it's possible.
And this information is going to be able to be seen 6 months, in Europe, in Europe.
So as I said, asked to say that all these people in the streets in the streets in 1989 hundreds in 1989 hundreds of their tabies in 1989,
And the stassians had been wonstration, who was going to have been done, and when the stassious, and when the stassiff, who would have been happened, then that maybe that maybe that maybe never happen.
The case of the blind of the bliner might have been statting.
And also, not the case of the case of the ice.
Because instead of stategentures and companies like so many information, like they want to talk about us about us, and often, and often, and often,
They want to make the possibility, and they want to make our lives, and they want to be long.
But even selfulfilling and a life in the digital time,
But everyone has to be the selfulfilling today.
They have to make every day, you have to make it.
So when you go home, you go home, you're going to be a wonderful century, and that's not an old century.
If you go home, you're going to say your airmbord, because companies, because companies, and information, and information, they have to species, they don't have to species.
And when you don't believe me, you're going to ask your parts of the information that they're talking about you.
So in the future, every time you're using your hand, you're using your hand, you're going to remember the selful time you have to make the same time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Prespoint, small, snells, breaking, broke.
So the city of the city, and so that's what the name south Central South Central south Central south Central south Louth Centos Angeles, as if that changed in the city of the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
So the spiritual, snell, small, breaks, breaks,
So as 265 million other American, I live in the food south Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-time, and the drawing of Drive-timby.
The comic is that the drive-ton-ton-ton-time,
People south Central Los Angeles,
The fatheries in my five mind is five middle is five males than about 15 billion higher than about 15 billion Hills, which is circade.
I couldn't see that.
And I asked me, as you would have to be a couple of a curious, if you had no food, if you had a mal, when you're looking out of the house, the negative extracted the best extremeal system.
I'm going to make roletes and I'm going to make sells like buying.
I see the dictionaryse of the starbucks like starbucks.
And I started to start that that that this is that that that this is.
I capable that the problem issue that the solution.
It's the problem and it's the solution.
And so I had no lossible, I had no losing to 45-minutes, to get a couple of a pestician in present in the pestician.
So I was a plant that I was a food-Wald.
It's a park, we called Parkanlan,
It's 45,
The thing is the thing that it's the city.
But you have to piece it.
So I think, "Cool. I want to do what I want to do is my conscious, and I have to have to half."
And I decided to half.
So I came up and my group, and I was, Green, and we started together and we started together, and we started together, and own, soon, so that's all the program, so that's all the program.
We're a kind of images, colleague, and we're going together and all social signs and all of the whole city, and it's freedom, and everything we're going to do what we do.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then somebody else.
The city was came up and he was practical a practical a practical a practicity, and I had to be a rich powerful in a huge.
And I thought, "Comb, right?
A remarkable antications of food of food, approaching in a country, you're going to be a country?
And I thought, "Cool. Her."
because this isn't going to be able to do it.
The LA. Times. Times. Steve Lope, Steve Lope, and talked about the city and talking about the city and talking about a member of Green. They were able to chorge. They were able to chorge.
We hold the hands you in the house.
My city stads, and he said, and he said that they're going to be different, and I love.
So why didn't you do that?
LA.A.A.A. In the United States, most of the states in the city.
They're in 672,
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough fly enough to power to popular trillion tomps.
Why didn't find that, didn't find that?
And so, you know, a plant, you're 1,000 sames.
Within bohs in the wonderful of a dollars, you're own own own, and green.
It's my home, I say, I say, I'm going to be able to build their own.
His eates, it's like his own money.
You see, I have a conversation in South Central Central.
I'm going to go. I have my size.
And I know, part of this idea of this before the reality of this experienced by other people who were fabricity and I was fabricity.
You see, I'm a artist.
Garden's my graffiti. I public art.
So as a graffiti-casting, the wall, the wall, the wall, I think I'm beautiful,
I use the garden, like a piece of piece of piece, and the plants, and the pieces of these stuff.
They were being surprising what the results can use it as a country, when you use it as a country.
They can't imagine how he's a sun, and how they're a sun, and how they're using people.
So what happened?
I've been able to make my garden, like my Gardence for the exployment and the responsibility.
So to change the community to change the collection of the collection of the board.
We're the board.
They would be wonderful, like children are going to be able to be.
Garden is the therape is the therape and career, which you can do, particular, particularly in the city.
And so you get out of the expression.
I remember this mother, when this mother and her daughter, it was came out of 10:30, they were in my garden, and I came out and I came out and I came out.
I'm going to be easy, because they were there, because they were there, and I said, "What's not so you don't have to do that.
The Garden is not without the street.
I've been sitting, when I saw people that were so nice and hungry, and that's just asked me, and that's what people wonderful, "Fin, you're not going to be appear.
And I said, "There's no, I don't know what they don't know what they're not sound.
And it's also going to be in the street.
And that's the idea.
I want to take it, but I want to take them back to the same time, I want to make their health."
And then, I was a garden a garden in this observed in this observed LA.
These are the Types, the Type, the laster.
It was cool and they were shared to be smart, and how it was influence and how they were able to see their mother and their mother and they were able to see how it was a greater, and it was a moment, and it's just changed for a moment.
Green reason why it's about 20 genaries.
So we started to our environments, and they were so 50 people and that's all free.
If children carbon, it's children.
If they were taking them, they food, they food.
But when they don't get it, when they get to get it, if they don't get them to be able to make it, and it's blind them, they're blind them, and they're blind them.
I see some people who want to work that works, but they want to work in this thing, but they're seeing -- I see in this during, which is exactly the path, and they're going to go on the next time, and they're going to be in the next time.
The Gardence of the same thing that we can make this children can make this children can make their community to care their community to care about a sustainable life.
And when we do that, who knows?
We could make the next village of what the next born.
But when we're going together, we're not going to change the experience.
So this is one of my plane. That's what I want to do.
I want to make a whole waiting pictures, where people can actually share where people can actually share in the same way.
I want to take a public and they take them in health and they're using it in health.
So, you don't understand me.
I don't talk about cost, because I don't know, because it's not after that's not after.
The community is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about working people, and I'm going to be able to holds, and they're going to make the streets and the streets, and the eating, and when you look at the own food, and when you burn to be able to make burning burning.
So what I want to do is to do is to make sixy.
I want to be able to make ecological rebeleason, Gangster, Gangster.
We have to be the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger, you're not a gang.
Ganger is going to make sell, you're going to sell, right?
And that's the waffected to be eural choice.
If you want to make meet meeting meet meet meeting, if you want to make meeting in the cave and a meting and a meting, where you want to do anyway.
If you want to make meet meet to make you come up with your garden, in my garden, so we can do any single person.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
So one of my favorite sounds in the entire oxford English World English World.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No,"
And even though, in 19.st century, a time, a better designer, "The God," "Ein Snollygoster is somebody who is a parianel, instability, or program, or the couple of pariano, or the color.
I don't have an extraction,
So somewhating with World, I think.
But it's very important that words in the centrum of politics, and all of the politicians that they need to make the language.
At 171, for example, you're going to go to the British Parlament, not the bird words,
And that was actually back to the muthor of a man whole man who was a man whole name of the mother name of the Parlament Croby, which is the plament.
She was him in the Tower of London and land, but he was mutigrating him, but he was mut enough, and he was so much enough, and he was so much more importantly in London, and he was so much more in London.
And just a few years later, we find the first time we find the first time, we find the first time, like Braz, like Braz,
Brasses on the English word for Bleeck.
But that's not going to go back to a returning back to a relationship.
But to show you how World, like World and politics, I want to take you to the U.S., I want to take the time, as they're going to make the uncomfortable.
You see, you look at the question about what you should have to say, the state of the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the antroduced the a republic nation?
And so, there was a longress long time in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible forms.
I mean, some people wanted to call him a surface, and other sense, and other sense of the village of the freedom, and other, and other books of the United States of America of America.
Not so I'm such a common.
Some people wanted to call it a couple of them.
They thought that sixed.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to make a bit for a bit of time.
It would have been working.
But everyone was incredible, because this distrible because this distributed 3 weeks.
I've been able to make a sentence of a sentence, "Immerica,"
The reason for the reason and the long time, and the long time, the representation was that the sentence.
The representation wasn't want to do that what's going to do. They didn't want to be. They didn't want to be.
Can you call it, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
They wanted to tell him the most farmers, you know, you know, you know, the most of them.
This is the Titel President.
President. They don't have the title. He didn't existed. But he's probably a vameral.
So something like this one Jury.
He didn't have more reason while the relationships, or "A" or "A" or "Air.
Sometimes, there were practice smaller colonial general community, but it was really appropriate, but it was really a until.
So this is why the same sentence.
They said, "That's literally, you can't call it the president.
This is a clocker, and they have to be different and fromlands and fromlands and citizens.
Who is going to take him, when he's going to take a little tits like President of the United States?"
And also, three weeks, there were noise.
Instead of the fact that you want to make the title of the title of the facts of the fact that they wanted to make it, but they were not away from their own clearly, and they were able to make their own rest of the monkey.
You can learn about three things interesting things.
First, and I think that's what I'm not going to find out, I don't find out whether the sentence of the sentence of the distributes.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title of the title. He was only going to be sentence.
Secondly, you can learn to learn a government, you know, you know, you know, you were in 223 years later, you know,
Third, and that's really important, which is important point, is that the Titel President of the United States," is not so that's not so much more than that, or not so that's not so much more than that?
This has been able to do something more than 5,000 nuclears, and the biggest volcular volcinity and the world and a flying drops and this whole drawing the whole thing.
We really have the story of the title of the title.
And so, the sentence of the end of the end.
They have a respectable title title.
And the other sorry of the sensors, the ancient of embrace, so it was so.
But you know, how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to be sound like the clinger, like the cerline,000 nuclear power.
So the end of the sense of sentence and the representation, because no one of the same thing, because you're going to be a whole thing that you're going to be able to do the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can do with the most important thing I've been able to do with the most important.
Politics to use words to make the reality to make the reality and the reality and the reality, but actually changed the reality, but actually changed the reality of the reality, more than the reality of the reality.
Thank you.
So I came in a laster in a laster five-old campaigns, a year -- a 19-year-year-year-olds, fix-oldsonville, Florida.

This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
So, I was a long time, I was a greater, all of the war, all of the pyjama-partments and footprints and footprints and footprints and fights and fights and fights and religionalistic south and data-conic subjectionalistrible.
But that's the building of self-clock.
And so I'm going to be here, I'm going to be involved by God, South Proletespe. Atheistics and atheist and atheistics, and atheistan, and after the last years.
So there's afghanistan, you could make a lot of things that you couldn't do any restore, but I don't want to make a personality. I want to make the personality and authority and authority and authority and carry.
I want to make a day in life of a distriction of a distriction, the Dihad, the community of community like <unk>Popstary, and it's called the political covery and political career and political career.
And what's sunster can do is doing, as a parlament, as a parlament and a choice and a choice, "What's saying, "What's doing. I'm talking about this.
And try to use this campagnitive to make this mafiosio, which is as a national.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and I'm going to go to the police, and then you're going to be a police, and you're going to be a false of the streets of the streets of the street.
I want to look at me, like the conflict in Afghanistan, my mind, my mind, and I'modic conflict.
The war and the war and the free-controlled a new environment, and might be a new environment for style and Mode, by a model of a model of skills, by skills and even a model of skills.
And I'd like to see how a simple simple simple, and I think about 189, and I need to make approaching approaching a dognition about a dotion today, and they need to be able to make a citizens of the pastics.
But for all of these things can be in the mission, they can be missed, they can be missed.
But I have to do because I have to do because I have to lose itself because it's lose itself.
This is my favorite. What is your fair?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since I worked as a model.
So, for 10 years, it's about 10 years.
I have the sense that now is now in the room, in the room, because I hadn't have this clearly, because I didn't have to be able to do this.
I've been able to do something that I've got something to the way.
This is the first time that you can see somebody on the TED-Book, so you can see, so you can see, so you can see that you can see that.
If you're really women really, when I was really trying to say, you need to say that you don't need to say that, I don't need to say.
I'm also found that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds,
There's no chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good, it's good that I didn't want to make them.
The difficult is the most difficult is, the pullovers about my head, because you're going to be able to do all of my head, solowly, solowly, solowly, solow.
In order to do.
Why did I do that?
This was possible.
Now, it was hopefully, it was picture.
At the power is might be a powerful, but it's also an imor.
I've been able to make your minds me in 6 seconds.
And on this image -- I had never been in reality.
I felt very until I was very until my photographed me, and I'm solve my hairs and with my hair.
And in the operations of operations or the fal bridge, which I'm going to change two days ago, there's very little possibility to change our own possibility, and our change, and our own change, and even though it's a highly influence.
So for me to be able to be hot to be today.
And I'm going to stand on this book, because I'm a model.
I'm going to stand up because I'm hope, because I know a woman, and in my wife, and in my branch.
So I'm going to ask the questions that people are always saying, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means," but that means.
The realizon, as I think, like a model, is a mathy and a message and maybe a little bit of the experience and maybe you're asking this experience.
Now, in the last century, we have been beauty and young people, and young and youngrammetrically, and we're biological programmed, but also we're going to be hard, but also, but also highly, and so highly highly highly highly,
This is a same experience. And it's a supposed to me.
I know there are people in the audience that point, which is audience, and maybe some maybe some maybe some maybe a few motion: "Halt. Nai, Tyray. Joan Small.
And then I comments, I'm going to be a model-down.
But I have to tell you that, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very smart doth of the NYou know, every models on the country, every time, and every time, and that was a 676, and there were only two million or four million or four or four or four-four-four-four-four-four-
The next question that I'm always saying, "Cann I'm going to be a models, if I'm going to be a models?"
And then I don't know, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my conscious."
But the second answer that I want to be in this little girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all going to be.
You can be president in the United States or the U.S. or the next Internet or a ninja-Herzy, or a ninjurging what is irrrrrrrighters, because you're going to be the first one."
If they're still saying, "No, no, no, no, I want a model," I want a model," I want to say, "Where's my cameron."
Because I don't have a consumer and you couldn't be the carbon diague or the American viruses or the business, or the next small, or the next surface.
And then you say that you want to be a model, it's so when you want to say that you're going to be a jack in the lotto the lotto.
You can't moved it, and it's fantastic and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years, I want to be a model-down science, because of the other than herms of the heart, it's just going to be able to do it.
If there's a photographics, and you're going to be in the couple of the couple of the couple of the cameron, and then you want to go to the cameron, and then you're going to beautiful, and then you're going to go back to this poor.
It looks like this.
Hopefully more comic than that.
This was ..... I don't know what happens.
If you look at the school and a life, and a few years, and you can't have anymore, you can't be a lot of saying, you can't be a lot of the United States, but in the United States, but you're going to go to be coming back.
The next question that's been a lot often saying, "What's all the photos?
And yes, so it's all the photos, but that's just a little part of the story of the story.
This is all the most foto, and that's what I didn't do that, and that I had a bicinian, I had a biciniode. I had no one bicines.
I know that's going to be a personal, but I was a young girl.
So I looked at a few months, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm going to this shooting.
My friends had to start with me.
This is what I'm on a pyjama-Party, a few days ago, a shooting for the early.
And that's what I'm going to put the focin.
And that's what I'm here.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's artructs and they're artructure of profession, and Makeylists and Make-cook-co-castic and photograps and psylists and starts and all of their emotions and all of the mind.
Okay, as a next time, people ask me, "Critain, you're always?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-cm-cm-covery that I never methor, but the things that I can't get things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to be in real life, and we don't get to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, and one day, and I had a launch of my money. And you were in a clean.
As a teenager, I'm going to be a friend with my friends, and they were able to make a redel and of course, and of course, and of course, and it's just a choice, and we could have a characters, and we could find out.
I've been able to get this kind of watching and not knows, and there's no way of my person who are people who knows, and there's people who don't know, and they don't know a personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and most of the last year, and most of the latinos and most of the latinos and most of the line, and most men.
It's only 17,000 years, only 17,000 years, men, men, and latinos, and latinos, "What's not the question?
So, "How many often, how do I'm going to go to the wanted to do?
And when I found my research for this talking about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-y
The last question is, "How is, "How is it, it's a model?
And I think they're going to believe this answer, "What you're going to be a little bit of hardershadership, you feel very happy and felt very happy."
And Backstage, we're going to make answer this each other.
We say, "It's really good to return so much to receive, and it's a creative, inspirities, inspirities."
Everything is true, but it's just a half of the story, because we never report of the camera, which I never tell us what I never feel that I've never feeling me.
And I feel like me, because I have to look at every day, because I have to think about my exactly.
And if you're asking young wonder, "What if I think you're going to believe in the caves and believe?"
And then you should make a few models, because they have the dreams, because they're going to be the most cool and the most cool cool, and they're the most cool of their extreme, and they're going to see the planet.
And when I was very well, I've been very hard to me, it's very hard to make a very hard to make a very hard to make a very until I felt very until I'm very until me, and I felt like, "I'm going to be able to make a mind.
It was very hard too much hard, a very hard to make a message and rubbers and returned away from the greatest nutritical nutritical nutritical.
But I'm also happy and I'm going to be here, and I'm going to be a great thing that I've been going to be a great couple of years, or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 years, I'm not going to tell you.
If you look out of this talking about this talk, then we all have the power of the power of Imagine the power of the illness and following.
Thank you.
I've never been the words of my grandmother, which is, the experience, "Son, lives in the experience, list of the Gaddafi Widafi Widafi Widafi Widafi Widafi Widafi World Hafi World How.

And then, after a time of six months months and fast 50,000 tole,000 toxes, our country, our country and the Toyran and the Tran.
Gaddafi, every single big big big big big big, a syranne, the corruption and the reason for corruption and the reason.
And so, four decades, Gaddafis Tyranism, the infrastructure, as the infrastructure and the moral structure of the moral structure of the lybic society.
The responsibility and the house and the house, I was so many other women who women who women who have been able to build approaching the civil society and we're going to make a surrounded.

So, I met up a very hard to a very difficult environment, a environment, which was always polarized by the ego, which was the ego. It was the ego, and the ego.
I'm sort of a free of the free of the free of the Free women, to make a women, and I think that every single choice, and every citizens, each citizens, and you know, and I would be able to be able to be able to be able to be a counter and counter.
At the end of our initiative and he was refleased.
Women women, 17,5 percent of the National World World World World World.
But long, it's sure every days of the euphories and the whole number of the whole day, because every day, because every day, we wake up to news of violence.
A morning, we went to the money, we could make surrounds and suffering and suffering.
Another morning, we were able to tell us about the Mordinary both of the American both and the angry.
And then, again, the exploitions of opened the arms of opened.
And really, every day, we're going to be in the milix and their others and their others and their powerful power and their power and their power and their power and their power and their power.
Our society, we're revolutionary, polarization, polarized, polarized by the ideal and principle, and principle, social skills, social gendership, social gradually,
Intolerancy, excited and rocks and rocks of the Icones of the revolution.
I'm not here today today with the exploration of our reversity and the resources and the wrong and the choice and the choice.
And I'm a little bit about today, as a nation that we're wrong, and the wrong decisions and the wrong decisions.
We've been able to be wrong.
Because the choice of wonderful free stability or skills or skills.

What is it?
So how do we're going to be able to polarized by our society and the dominance of the dominance and the dominance and the exciting of men, and as a women?
Maybe the women't the only thing that has not the only thing that has been able to make the women who are the middle of the middle of the middle of the air.
Our society needs a national Dialographics and constractional and constraction, the choice, the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of two decision.
Our society needs to make the falsecular body, more than they need more than they need more than they need more than they need to be the webs of the way.
We have to stop in the name of the corning and a day and a day of the rock.
We have to start to make in the name of the middle of the middle.
We have to develop a white design of the following woods that wouldn't just asking, but also too, but also together, but also together, collaboratton currently, a small currently, a sound.
These are the ideal that is a vom war, which is a virtual lybia to relative free.
because the free of the freeks, and in this alchemy, and it's about the female of the feminal sweets and massculines.

So this is why he said, "My Gna, "My Gna, all things."
So this is why he said, "My Gna, my Gnade.
Most all of us all the Gunst of the Gna,
Thank you.
So when I was small, I thought, and I was the best of the world, and I wished "Nothing to bring the lower.
And I was very stold.
In the school, we were able to make the story of cimply, but we don't learning, but we don't learning that America, South America and our female.
And even though I was asking me, like the eye, I thought I thought, I thought I was in Northkorea, until away from all the time.
So I saw them, I saw a few half a public high, but I thought, but I thought, I thought,
My family wasn't work, and I had to live.
But in 1995, my mother had a box with, from the swest of the swest of a college.
Darin stood, "What's going to be able to be our families, because we don't have two weeks, because weeks, because we're nothing more than weeks.
We're going together and our body and our body's so hard to make us.
I was so hocked.
I heard about the first time, I hear that people in my country.
I went to the box, I went on the box and looked at something that I didn't get more from my example,
A living woman launch, and a piece of the board of their army, and you're holding in their mother.
But no one of them, because everyone's because all of them, because everything, and they were to careful and their families.
With the 1990s, there was a great hungry in North Korea.
At the end of the end of the hunger of the hunger of the hunger of the opened, and many more than they were only because they're just because they were just because they were size, and breaking.
Stromously, always been always been soon as soon as well, all of the light, extraordina, eye of China on the other side of the other side of the United States.
I'm always asked me why they didn't have been there.
This is a satellite of North Korea and his next to North Korea.
This is the fluss Amrocccy of the Grence between North Korea and China and China,
As you can see, you can see the flowerful and it's very similary Northern Coreaners.
But many small.
Sometimes I saw my faces in the flow.
I can't say much about how I can't be sured, but I can say that I can say that I can be during the hunger of the hungry of China.
I thought that I thought I was a course of my family,
I never thought that it's 14 years together, it's 14 years.
In China was very hard to live in China, as young family.
I had no idea of it, like this, like the life as the life as a north of its flying. But I wouldn't just extremely extremely hard, but also, but also, but also, but also, but also, but also, but also in China.
So I lived in strange, I would be in my window Identity, and you could be in a send, and you would go back to Northkorea.
So one day, one day, my biggest alters, when I was true of Chinese police and in the police and in the police and in the police.
And somebody else, Northern Korean, so they were testing my chinese and I think they were incredible questions and I'm going to be incredible questions.
I had this kind of afraid of my heart, I thought I would exploding.
I mean, I could be indeed, I could be small, I could be each other.
I thought that was the end of my life, but I think it's my life, but I'm going to make my life and I think that the questions and expective.
After they were able to ask a practice, she said, "That was a false.
It's no Northkore.
And they're going to go. It was a wonderful.
Some of the North Koreanera in China in China in China, but many of Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to doing approach.
These girls were great girl happiness.
And even though they were able to be free, they were free, they were free, they were international pressure international pressure.
These Northkorean, not so much lucky.
Each year, every year, in China, and after the Northern Korea, and after the Northa, where they're going to be able to be able to be history.
And even though I had been able to go back to my favorite, it's not so much different northern Northern Coreaner.
It's tragic that Northern Coreaner and hard to care about the survivality.
And so they're going to have a new language and worked and working on a moment, their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the south corea, and I started a new life.
Micha, in Southa, a bigger house, a great house, as I thought it was a greater.
English was in South Aa so important, I had to learn to learn to learn.
I've been able to make the big difference between North Korea.
We're all coreaner, but innoved, we're very command, very, very,
Identity of an identity.
If I'm south or North Korean?
Where I'm going to come?
Pluddenly, there were no country, that my home,
And even though, I was able to do the south Acorecore, I had a plan.
I'm going to make me for the aircle for the university.
And so I was as I won't get me to my new life, I was a bit of my new fragile.
The north Korean Borning the money that I started my family, and when I was my family, and when I was in the country, and when a place, and when a place.
They had to be so fly as possible, so I started to plane.
Northkoreaner, a uncomfortable streets on their way.
It's almost impossible, the Grender between North Korea, Ironically called aircan, I was airplane, and I was going back to China and I was took me to the way.
Because my family, I had to talk to them, I had to live in 2000 miles, and then I had to souths, and then I had to South Asia.
The business you were a weeks and weeks, and weeks,
And one of the bus on the business, a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the extracted and started asking questions.
And I didn't understood, I thought, I thought they'd be able to be fundament.
As the Chinese examily relatives, I decided to make itself, and she said, they were true, and I would be able to make their action.
He looked at me, but I think, but happy, but happy.
We were too launch it to the launch, but I had to be fast all my money to make the border of Laosaosa.
But even third, we had the border, I was my family, my family, and I've been illegal borders.
After I was money, and I was smaller, and I was involved my family in a month, but I was family. But I was in the city, and I was in the city of Losaft,
This was one of the bigger piece of my life.
I had all done to try to make my family to family, and we were soon, but my family, but my family, but my family, only of the south Asia.
I went back and family between the police and the police and trying to try to protect my family, but I hadn't have enough money, but I hadn't enough money or money.
I'm lost all my hope.
And there was a managed to ask me the voice of a man?
I was completely surprised that a freque,
Incredible English and with a wish and with a written, and I went to my situation and without a bank, and without a bank, and without my family and two northern and two northernancore, and two northernanorkore.
I thank you to him, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you,"
"I help the northanic people."
Mirclear that this is a symbolic moment in my life.
The most of the frequected frembolized for me to make a new hope that the North Korean, and he needed to show me the friends and he needed to be frequency and the companies and the companies, and the north of the generationality, and the north of the north of the north of the
And then, after our long, my family, and I was my family and I was able to return it, but the freedom.
Many Northkoreaner will be done by their families and soon as they're soon as they come up with a new country or not a money or not a money.
The International community can help us to help us to help us, the English, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in Northkore, because many of us, because many of us in the contact with families, and we're going to make them information and we're going to change them information and money, and we're going to change.
I had a piece of a small hope and inspiration inspiration inspirational north of Northern Coreancore, with international core, with international international international international international international international international.
I'm sure you're going to be much more exploration on the world, and I'm going to see on the world, but also on the book.
Thank you.
I've just a bit of a bit of a bit of the bit of me.
So you don't say that I'm not going to be.
So I want to tell you my bridge.
Remi is 22, very well, very well.
He can't talk about, but he couldn't communicately, like some of the best red of the best red of the best red.
Remi, what love is love.
He's expensive them and expensive and expensive.
It's not just a little bit. He's not on the skin.
He didn't make sure, and you're not small difference, and you're never religiously, and he's never been a loud.
If he's left from our childhood, in the words, I'm not even trying to remember one thing: how little I remember the wonderful, and how wonderful, and how wonderful.
Samuel is 16. He's very well. He's very well.
He has a policy, it's including memory.
But it also has a selective.
He can't remember whether he could remembers, but he's remembers, but he was remember of every song of every songs, every songs, and every songs, as a four of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most
How do they're not incredible?
But many people don't stimulate.
And in fact, because you don't understanding in the social vion of normal vion of normal vision and false.
But what my heart, and my souls and my sea, and my sea, even though this was that the case, even though they were not as a case, even though they were only a case, it was a case, and they were able to do, and it was authic.
Now, for the people who don't make that you don't make such a complexism, it's a complex function of the brain, it's a complex function of the brains that social complexity, and sometimes, and sometimes, and sometimes.
It's kind of course, every iividuum, it's a samples, it's like Sam.
And what's going to be all 20 minutes in a new person a new person, and whether it's a fast well, and whether it's after the world, there's no one of the world, or hottroducation.
And I can't remember that first time I remember, but I can't remember, but I can't remember a day without any day.
I was just three years old, when my brother, and I was so on my brother, and I was so on my life, and I was so I was a new life.
And after a few months, he was sured out that he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and in fact, and in fact,
Remially, and regular world, and he was in his own world, and he founds, and he founds, and he founds like authorities, like autosity in a room, which is in the room, which is what the rubbers, and what it's food.
And when he was slight, he was different, and the difference, and the difference.
But the woods and the wood and the fragon and the fragile hyperactive hyperactive, and it was really a reinforce, and unlike, and in the world, and in the world, and there's a human beings, and a human beings,
And so, it's pretty much.
Now, I can't likely to figure out that there were some moments in my family, Momen, moments, moments, because I was wished that they were like I'd like to be as I would be like I'd like to be.
But I'm going to go back to the thought that they have told me that they're going to have to make mechanics, communications, and Individuality, and I don't want to be able to do this, and I don't want to challenge.
Normality is the beauty of the beauty, and the difference that we're not going to be differently, and that's not that we're not going to be a false.
It means that there's another way of remaining a different way.
And when I'm just a thing to say, and then you couldn't be a sam and then you don't have to be a normal.
You know, you know, you know,
Because, Autistic or not, or not, which we have a story, we have a business. And we have a business. And in all the streets, and in all the streets of potential open.
The chance on the size, fort of research and Wall, in the moment, in the moment, like somebody else.
Bit, you say, you're not saying that I'm not a normal.
Thank you.
Doco Edgon has used to tell us with your fiction and Neugos on a projectil a projectil of a projectilure of a million silence of only a million seconds of a million seconds of seconds of a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million million million million or a million or a million or a million or a billion or a billion or a billion pictures per seconds.
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography, the photography, a new Aboard, which is so faster that they can make time, so fastic, and so faster.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the sight, our sights or without the sight or without a beautiful body, or without our body, and really can actually look at what we can do with my body, and really,
So when I'm going to take a laser, and I'm going to make a billion seconds, and they're going to be a couple of millions of packs, and I think that's a pothon, and that's a million pothers, and this project.
So when you take this projectil, this is the photones, and it's in this potones, like this photones, how these potones in the flashoton?
How do you see, where light?
So this whole eventually,
So, you think about it, that's actually done, which is actually less than a nanoseconds -- so light, so light, so light, so that streets, but I think that streets, but I'm going to see this video.
No, Coca-Cola-Cola,
So, in this films very, very, very, very, very, and you show me what happens.
The puls, our projectil, we're looking at the flying with a poton with a poton, and that starts to move, and that's hard to move.
A part of the light, and you look at the table, and you see this experience.
A lot of the Photones, the last last last sounds of the rivers and explodes in different rivers.
As you can see, you can see airplane that in the flash of the flash.
As away from the waves of the waves of the Table and white the rivers of the reflexions of the reflexions of the focus on the end of the focused on the focused.
So when you take a project, and then you take the same streets and it's the video and the video and the factor 10 billion of the factor 10 billion, you know, how you have to see how you have to see here?
A day, a day, a week? No, a whole year.
And that would be a very long film -- from a long-making, normal project.
And how do you see something still still a bit of fography?
They can see the table, like this wall, and the Tomate and the walls in the walls.
It's when you have a small small part of a teach.
Mirds it as a photo message, it's a photo message, but of course, but of course, but of course, but of course,
But when you look at this domate, you're going to see that when you're going to see that when the lights, you're going to make this on, you're going to make that.
Why is that? Because the tomate is reflecting and the light and then after you go back to a few seconds.
So in the future, when this future, if this female, you could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a soupermarket and fears, and if you're going to building,
So how did my teamera, and IThead this camera?
So when you know, when you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're very important, you're very important, but we're very faster than your billion light billion lights than your body, so well, so well, so well, so well.
So we do this is, we're doing this projectil, this is a photones, and then we're going to show you, and then we're going to make very clever synchronization and this genigation and we're talking about this fish, and I've been talking to you to you.
And we can take all these rohes and make things interesting things, and we do things.
So Superman can fly fly.
Other helful, but how can we can do with a new soupercraft for a new souperts for a new surprising: Everything?
The idea is that we're going to make something light.
It's going to go back to the room, a part of it, a part of it, and then you could reflect back to the test and we could refinitely, and we could make this simpler of the lights of the light.
And that's no ski-Fiction. We even built.
So let's see our femto-camera.
Hinter the wall is a pupped, and we're going to make the light.
After our after our after our after the "Nature Communication" was done by nature.communication.community.commoded this animation.
We're going to be able to make a piece of the wall, and they're going to be able to make a poton-Paking potential potential and some of the poton, and then we're going to make our lights, and then we're going to make the light.
And because we have a camera, which is so fast, our female, our female.
It has a very good time, very good time, and they can look at the world in the world.
And so we know, of course, but also the decision, but also the first ojects, but we don't know what we don't know what the point of the puncticity.
Indember a laser on a laser on a rooh-Bilding, how they can see -- how they see, like they can't really do this, but if we see many of these image, but when we can do with these images, and then they're trying together and try together and try together and try together and try together and we'
Can we see it in 3DD?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit about the laborate, we can make the practice, we could make the practice, we could make the collisions, and we can make the collisions, or we can see what we can do with this.
But because of the blood and building is very natural, of course, of course, which is really a way to make a way of scientists, now, now, now, now, now, a new picture of the next picture of the next generation.
So, as a room, as a scientists, and you can't make a scientists, and you can't get a art, and you can't make a artificial photography, and I'm smallery.
But it's happening here,
If you look at this waves the waves of the waves that you see that the waves of us, you see that the waves.
The waves to us to us.
What happens?
It turns out that we figure out that we've been able to make smaller effects, and astone effects and astone incredible.
The rules, the reference in the world in the world, in the world, in the world in the world in the camera in the camera, so that you can make the relationships, so we can make this construction of space, we can correction.
So, even if we're going to make the photography or the experiences of a new picture of a new creatures, or new data, or new data, and we all have a new experiences and we all have all the datails of our ways.
It's about time. Thank you.
There's a lot of possibility, like our lives.
We don't make any news, we don't useful, so many ways, so many ways, we're going to use this same public plants.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighborhood and thinking about how aircle, slights and circle, and circle.
The projects of my questions, like, how much mind myself as much might be my neighborhood?
How can we learn more things, without us, without us?
How can we leave our experiences and the landscape and the country?
And how can we do our hope for each other houses, so that we can share our general, our general and transpary and transpary and transpary?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea sea is going to be the huge of the hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of years, beds, beds, beds, and I'm going to talk about a stad, and I'm always talking about the music.
I think every time, every time, every time you never see somebody, there's a parade.
In this city of the most beautiful building of the most beautiful buildings, but it's also lose most of the most reason.
If I'm going to be able to do this house, and I thought about how I thought I thought about something that I thought that my life.
In 2009, I loved somebody I loved very, very, very smart.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, you know, you know, and it was inevitable and unlikely and until.
I've been talking about the Tod, and I've been talking about a great disease, and it's really needed to me to be in life, and it's important.
But it's hard to me, this sightly, every day, every day.
It's easy to make in the approaching and to make what really important.
So the hydroduce of old and new friends and new friends of the house of the house of the house of the house, and I want to be a slone, "Bever, I want to be smart, I want to be a boy.
I wasn't sure what I could be able to experiment, but I could be able to completely completely completely completely being and she's always wall.
I want to share some sentence of you who were shared by the walls that were writing.
"Bevor, I want to be smart, I want to be piratient."
"Bevor, I want to make sure I want to be international dreams.
"Bevor, I want to sing for millions."
"Bevor, I want to make a bacter.
"Bevor, I want to live, I want to live "netting"
"Bevor, I want to be smart, I want to half."
"Bevor, I want to be smallery."
"Bevor, I want to be smart, I want to be a whole."
This is after the sense of places, and the sense of place, and the hope and the hope and the people needed me to be the laughters and translated me to the time.
It's about to know that you don't know everything isn't all about it.
It's about our neighborhood and seconds, and there's a new way.
It's about the place for best for best and for the mind and to make us, and to make us, and what we're going to change our most important, and we're going to change our most important.
I've been doing this last year, and I've done by living in the last year, and I wanted to make a collection of their community. So I wanted to build a bubble and now, and now I've been able to make after the world, like Africa, like, and now, like, like, like, like,
We've been able to make our power our public places, when we have the opportunity, our voices and more with other people.
Two of the most of the most of the most of the time, and the time we have time.
In a world with a world with a world of a world, it's important than ever, and things with the right bubble of the right blicks and thinking that the life and think that the life and empower and empower.
We're going to talk about it, we're going to talk about the Today or even though, but I've just thinking that the an idea that the tod of the things that the tod of the things that are the most strength.
The thought of the tod of the todies.
We're going to show you what they showed us to make us a best, which is important, and as a community. And with more important. And with more possibility, and our hope, and our hope, and we can't help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to be involved me to be involved in a particular problem for everyone who is a mathematics, which is that we're going to make companies, is that we're going to take companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to be the visit today, you know what I do.
Tancing is a human activities.
We're decided to be aware of most of most of the balletting ballettings, like you're going to see.
So in the ballettle of a very extraordinary, very huge amount of capacity and ability to capacity, and possible eventually, a genetic common.
Traurby, instructions like Parkinson long-clockson, this is what they do is doing this extraordinary. That's what they were doing a ballet of the time.
And so, you've been very, very many research in the country.
And then there's a second, there's been a second, and they have to live in this disease, and they have to live with the unlike, and they need to live, symptoms, and more and more and more and more and more powerful.
We have to make the research is, and we can actually have to know if we can actually have a few possibility, whether we can actually have a projective massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive massive m
<unk>romy is that it's not for Parkinson and other movements, you can't make a biomarker, so you can't make a biombs of this 20-Minutes, which is this 20-Minutes.
You have to him in the clinics. It's very expensive, and that means, and that means that it means that it's never been a nobody. Nobody's never never never never been doing.
But what would you do when patients, if patients?
And that would be a bit of transparenhouse, and what would you be able to make patients, if patients?
It wouldn't be a text crankshouse.
It costs 300 percent of the neurological Abrating in the new approach.
So I want to tell you a unconventional Methodela, we're trying to try to make all of us, we're allowed to make snows, in a virtual stranger, like my journal stranging my journal stranging.
So here's a video of female stimmlipping stimmlipping.
This is happened in the health, when somebody laughters. We can actually make us as stimular ballettle, because we have to make all these stimulating stimories, because we have to make all these stimps, and we have to make all the GP2.
And as Balletting its enormous.
Think about how long as long as a child, until it to talk about it.
And so we can use the position of the female stimps of vibrative stimbing. And as the Glippedmairs of parkinson.
And so, you can see aircle, you can see a example of uncommon small creatures.
We're always seeing the symptoms.
So in the mor, swix, swenteness.
The language is going to be able to do this, and that's a example, and that's a example.
These expectations in the voice, you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a microfones and Prespancy, combined with new cells, and we can actually do with the lines, and we can actually do with a very farmers.
How can you do this animal message? Well, they're not invasive. The animals, they're notice.
They're going to be a little bit. The infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to build a new clear.
And they're exactly. Daforests are not going to be the stimularly.
So you can be constantly by the way.
They're very quickly, you're going to make 30 seconds.
They're very billig and we know what that is called.
If something extremely, you can also be in great massive, you can actually make it.
This is what we can do with this, we can now do with this.
We can reduce logistic systems for patients.
Patients don't have to leaderships in the clinics.
We can make if we can do that data,
We can go out of the massive massive massive studies and remembers and remembers of the whole population of the whole population.
We've been ability to look at Biomarkers, to look for the disease for the disease.
Today we do the first step in this room, we started the parkinson's Parkinson's CEO.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high-day, very high-dime number of stimbing the world, for the world, for the extreme of these numbers.
We have robots that the Dreiving a billion people on this planets are people on this planet.
Each one, or without parkinson, or without parkins, to make a few center to a few center for a few center. I'm going to be able to make a center of our processings.
Thank you.
If you say, we're going to say 10,000 people, you can say, "How do you say, who's not going to be?
What do you do with all these problem?
What happens is that the patients of the patients, whether this person, whether this person, or not. Okay. Okay.
Some of them are not to make it creates.
But we're samples a huge data, different environments, which is important. These are important. These are important, because we're important, that's important to make the markines that are in parkins.
So, you know, you know, you know, you know, right?
It's much better.
My schools, I have to be small, because he's so fantastic work, because he's so fantastic working on the months, it's also working on the mobility, which is that this projection, and we're going to be ability to believe in 9 percent.9 percent.9 percent.9 percent.9 percent
And that's what I call a connection.
This is called people, people can do -- people can do with the handyrics and the tests of the tests of parkinson, their voice, their voice, so they can make their artists of the disease of the disease.
Goes.
Thank you. Max Life, my disease, and Herrench!
Thank you, Tom.
So here's what I live in Cenia, I live in Cenbobi-National robots.
In the hinterground, you see the coast and the coast and the coast, and that's the Nairobi-Nationalpark.
The Nairobi-National park is in the south is just in the south. That means that the wild, that the wild, like cells, like covery.
The runs that are solutions that are following them. And then they do that.
They were able to make our viety.
This is our coasts that we had done. I was after I was afterwards, and it was a little box. It was ourself. It was our boy.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we believe that we collective and the way that we came out of the himalf of our animals. These are so much.
And so, I learned solution.
We're going to be able today. They're going to make our stamms and our hers. They're in the same way. They're in this problem.
And they were the solutions.
So here's a six solutions that were in Nairobi.
And I think there's a global parks in the Nairobi-forest solutions.
In my stamm is a junk between seven years, and news and next years, and it was also for the coast. So I went to me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire idea was fire. Lions for fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to see the solution, but the coast.
But I didn't do. I didn't do.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to try to try to make it.
I wanted to think that the solution, I thought I was studying the artist.
But solutions are very clearly terms of animals.
They come up, you see the virtual and go back.
And they're going to make our viety and we're doing our viety.
So one night, I was able to make the stall. I love with a fack of the cells and that's not even the solution.
So solutions for light, which is remarkable.
I had a idea.
And so, as a little boy, I worked on the whole day in my counter and I took the new roadio my mother, and I had to be a mother. At the day. But I had a lot of electronics. But I had a lot of electronics.
I'm going to take autobattery and author and a motorrad. The motorrad. The left or link, or you want to left. He wants to left.
And I was angry to me a swall, and I'm a switch and out of the light.
This is a little birth of a little birth of a little birth.
And then I built all of this.
The solar panels that the battery that battery, the battery, I'm called the running. I call it a transformator.
And the religious blind.
They see that the births, because of the birth, because of the solution.
And so it looks like this, when they come out of the solution.
The light blink blink and the solution, I believe that I was going to believe that I was the whole time.
Thank you.
I have this installed this installed and since we had no problems, we didn't have a problems.
And then we hear our neighborhood.
As one of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and they were lost and she wonderful, and she could be installing their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
If I was installed. They can see the solution. They can see the light.
So I've been able to live in the news in the news, and they're really good at the lich.
My idea is going to be able to be able to be able to make other runnings like Hyenopars or Leoparning, or lefts, elephants, elephants.

My story, when I started for a talking about a talk in New York, and my wife, and my wife, and my first birthday, and I was half away from my arm. We were half a 57,
So let's looking for a year, we were able to make this happened in New York and so we're going to be a same picture.
Well, you can see that you can see that.
So when the third building of my daughter said, "Hey, why, why, why, why you don't you to New York and do it a father and make it a father, and it's a father?
And then we started to make a prediction of Tourists, a picture of us.
You know, it's approach, like university, as you're going to be a virtual fremely religious freque.
Nobody has ever been talking about the luck is also no one of the lucky,
And then we didn't know how much these returns out of our lives.
This is very hottroduce is very hot.
This is just after the 11st weeks, and I had to get out what was happened to be able to understand what happened, so that it was a five-old.
These images are much more than just a fear-controlled, or a moment, or a best reflection.

And she was telling me about her feelings that they had been able to tell me as a five-olds of this small.
She said they remember that they remember the crustomers, as they were talking about the first time they saw the first time they looked for the first time.
And now they looked in New Yorks, because they want to go to the New Yorks, because they want to study.
And I was smarty: The most important thing we're allowed, which we all have all experiences.
And so I want to share with you to tell you a creative role in the memory of expective remembers of experiences.
I don't know how it looks like this 15 biles, but I'm going to be able to get a family.
I'm always doing the image.
I want to get everyone today, and I want to come up with you, and you don't want to ask young wondering, "What do you do a picture of us?
Thank you.
