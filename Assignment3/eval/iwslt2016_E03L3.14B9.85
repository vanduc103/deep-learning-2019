When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the clen who were helling the clen.
My father heards on his little bits, women who are the news of the news of the BBC.
He looked very happy to what happy to do is pretty unusual, because most of them were increased to be the next thing.
He running: "The Taliban are wrong!"
I didn't know what that means is that what I did was really happy, but it made very happy.
"You can go on a right school," he said," he said," he said.
The morning I'm never been able to figure.
One of the right school.
The taliban, the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and I was based to school.
And so I five years, I five years long as June and began took my older, and I started my older, not more of all of them, not anything, to a snow.
And so we could go to school, we could go to school.
Every day, we went to a different way, even though, even though, where we could do.
We've been able to do our books in the left, so it's so that we were just a book, as well.
And we were able to get in a house, over 100 miles in a little wall in a little wall.
In the winter was, but in the summer, but in the Sommer was incredibly incredibly.
We all know that we knew that we know, teachers, teachers and our else and our else.
In the unfortunately, the difference for a week, because the taliban beings because the taliban being.
We were never been using how much they were all over us.
Do they recognize us?
Where are they know where we know where we know where we do?
We had angry, but we wanted to wanted to school.
I had great happiness in a family in a family, in the education as important as important.
My grandfather was his time.
One of a visiterally from a provincial provincial provinced to be after -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother and it was done by his father.
My mother filters, but it was teacher.
That's what they're.
And two years ago, she went to the rows, only to our house in a school for mountains and women and women.
And my father -- this was the first -- the first time, the first time, the first one of the first time.
For it was a bit, that his children would be a children would behavior, and it would be drop, tropss the taliban, trop.
He looked like a lot of larger Risk, his children not to schools.
I know that I know that I'm in the years ago, sometimes, sometimes, and sometimes of our lives, from our lives, and the perspective and the perspective.
I had good lusted to be a lot. But my father said, "Thatter," and then you can hear. You can be live in your life.
No, your money can be done. You can be in the war. You can be done.
But a thing is going to be done, and that's always what we're going to be here, and even when we're going to be able to do with your bubble.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, and I'm in a country, and I'm in the war.
Less than 6 percent of my alters have a higher than the seconds as the seconds as the seconds. And when my family. And when my family, and when my family, I would have a women.
Instead of the state of the college, as a state of the Middlebury College.
When I was afghanistan, my grandfather was my grandfathered by his family, because he was a bigger, because he was a bad, because he was a bad to school.
He didn't just talking with my hands, but also with my hands, but also the first woman who was the first woman who was the first woman, and I'm author.
My family believe me.
I have great decrees, but my family has larger animals.
So I'm a global bothers for 1010, a global warming campaign for the world.
And so I've been going to be sOLALALALA, and maybe some internative internative in Afghanistan, a country, a country, in the school, in the school.
It's wonderful to see how the schools, like the school with great earning everybody each of them all of them.
And to see how their parents and varter for them, like this, as I mean, and my parents, and I decided to be able to do all the time.
So as Ahmed. That's not really being name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my snow.
And they were a months were his taughter and he's been on the home of SOLA in their dork and they're just about a bombs in the streets.
When he was home, he went to home the telephone and a stimm, and a stimet, he was going to be fallowed to school, she would try to try to try to try to try to try to try to trying to trying to trying to try to get it.
And he said, "The said, "The I want to say, but I'm not going to be the future of my daughters, I'm going to be able to play about my older and overcredible and over against the older."
What Afghanistanistan, so I have something that I've got something that in the west often, the words often, the most of us, the first thing that's a value that he's a value that he's also being a value, and it's also being.
That's not today that our motters are not important role in our earth.
Thank you are harmers are highly the whole thing that are possible for a lot of a lot of a lot of their terms of their terms of their terms of a society as the infghanistan is the unfortable.
On the Taliban went to the taliban girls -- because it was someone -- because it was illegal.
Today, everybody in Afghanistanistanistanistan,
Afghanistanistan, from America, from America.
The Americans are recognize how us changes are changes.
I'm notice that the change of the change of distribution and they're all changing the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I'm sleeping in my school, and their parents, and their parents that they're going to take a lot of them, then I see a lot of a lot of future and then a lot of wall and a long-mane.
Afghanistan is for me to me a country and the university and the university, and it's impossibilities that are the sOLALALA.
And as I think they have great trees.
Thank you.
And everything I do what I do is, also -- my life -- my life -- my life was brought about working in Africa than ever.
And from 197, I see in 1977 -- I'm sambia, but not -- I've been in Sambia, Kenya, Cenia, Algeria, Algeria, Algeria, and Somalia, and Somalia.
I've been working for a laborator and every one thing we've been working on the box that we're standing on the box.
I was basically.
I thought, 21 years, we thought that we're good people are good working in Africa list.
Instead, we've done everything we're all statting.
Our first project, what my first project, which is my first book, "Ripples inspiration," was one that we want to show inspiration, one of the people who want to show you how nobody wants to show you how nobody wants to show you.
We came withinalia South America, in South Adambia, in this top of the Sambia, which is the Sambesi-Fli-Flime, and we live the animal relationships and Talian and Taliances and Talinci.
Of course, the answered the an interesting thing, so we didn't have in interesting them, and sometimes they're doing it.
We were instairs that it was in a so early not a so early country.
But attention to ask why they didn't look at the skin, we just say, "Goday,"
"Gerade," to return the people to return the people."
Of course, all of all wonderful in Africa.
We had this practice. Internet. In the Internalia, they were so big, in Sambia.
We couldn't believe it and said, "Sambine," and they said, "Sook, like skin."
When the tomates were red, and they were about 200 nights about 200 nights from the flow and frame.
We said to the Sambine, "Oh God, the Nilparter.
And they said, "Yes, we have no country, we don't have a country."
"Why didn't say, "I'm not said, "I'm never been using."
I thought, we were just so greateries were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the American, which is what the English changes that are doing what the focus, which I was doing what they do, I was doing in our project.
We felt the nilters to the nilk.
They should see the university -- you should see the university, because we don't know the remembers.
They should be the book of Dead Aida Moyo, and she's a sambic economy, it's a sambic economy.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have change the African countries have 15 billion euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been telling.
Les you just want to be the book.
Les you know from a African, what we've got to story.
We're important people are imperialists, colonialists, and there's two arts, like we're just two architects, or we're patriarch.
And the woman stills of the lathery "pather" which means "Vather"
But they have two different different businesses.
Patriarchalic: I'm not patrian, as a other culture, she love my children.
Patronisism: I'm not patronis, as a other culture, as if they were my distributed my distribute.
And so that's white people in Africa, Chea, Chefana, Chefana,
I was after that when I was the book, "Small" which is the book of school," he said, he said, he said, "You know, if people don't want to leave them in Ruzhead.
This should be the first principle of the head.
The first principle of the heart is Respect.
Today, the morning of the herror, who's the conference, a stab, and asked a stab, "Can you're going to be a state, not a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to reactive people, and he's been a system, and he's never been investment, and it's never been in someone in the motivated, but you're going to hear the distribution of the personaliances that you're the personaliances of the personal p
What you do -- you're doing -- you're doing.
You never never never been a community with ideas with ideas, you're looking at the only one of the simimple.
We don't work from Bros.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We do. We do in Kenya.
We don't have infrastructure.
We fly flying friends and find out what the person wants to find what the person.
The most important is the people.
You can't get some idea of a idea.
If these person doesn't do that?
The personal windows for the person is the most important thing.
The passion for the own words is the most important thing.
We help them to find the knowledge that knows, because no one can be anything.
The person with the idea has not maybe not knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this one of the same thing, in a community and people to say what they should do, why do we hearing them? But why do we hear it? But not in Germination.
Let me give you a brain.
There's a problem with community with community.
Our the neverage, and they're never been going to say what they're going to say what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they see.
Planation has this blind.
The clearly people who are created to effect them because they never create, because they never create.
We worked to do this to do this to do this to do this, to do this, social infrastructure, not existed.
One new business.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the bed of the Betry, who's in your head, and your cover, and in the cafits, and in the middle of your lives, and your lives information, and that's transformance to transform your life.
I have this inside, West-Australia, trying to trying to trying to trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try
I promovated to the time and tried to try and tried to decided to do what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had to help innerably three days, and I half of my first customers. I halfished him. He was a garage, and I was him. I him a restaurant.
I half these fishers, and I'm going to work and these wonderful three-ban-bany for 60 center in Albany for 60 center, but for Japanese for Japanese.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the regulation. The government, "What do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I do something very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
I hold the mouth and highly."
So -- -- so the government: "Mach you go to it."
We have been doing it in 300 genememement.
We've been 40,000 companies are going to be the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to understand the companies.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the story, story, story with 96.
Peter pressure was Philosophy was painting with companies, and he was businessed with company said, Peter Peter Peter Peterany, and it's independention and economy and economy."
Planation is the death of the companies of the companies of the companies.
So you're going to know, without knowing what the cover, which is the covery of human colds and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these tools to get to a tool.
You have to be distribution and privacy and privacy. You have to help them. You have to help them, and they're going to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the people?
And for the presentation, you have the most expensive, you know, you're doing now?
<unk>romic, embracy people. The food.
I want to say that the companies of the right ways of the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nichervolution -- nichels, fossil foots, and play, and there's not after it's not after.
The recognition is not afterward.
The Freon-Aron-Aron-traction is not after.
We have to look at how we have to look at the millions of people on the sustainable ways, transports, transports, transports and with them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will this technology for the large revolution? Universited?
The government? You know, you're going to be.
It's going to be able to do it. And they're going to do it.
I left a food story in a future in a future of years ago.
There were a group of Experts that were eing to be the future of the future of the city of New York New York New York.
In 1860 came up and speculated, and speculated what happened in 100 years ago, and the stad news. The shadow was a city: The city: The city was not existing, the city of New York.
Why? You look at the curve and said, and they said, and they said, when the revolution in this tempote, they needed to be sex million powerful millions to be able to hear the people, and it's impossible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Because they went to the mistor.
And 1860, they see the difficult technology that life looks like New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, 1900, there were 1001, there were 1001, 1001, 1001.
The idea that I had a different technology, and the rene, and there were little bit. It was just a little fabrics in the heart of the hand.
And then, Michigan. Henry Ford. Henry Ford.
There's a brain to work with companies to work with companies.
And when he had to be distributed to be able to be.
One of them, they don't talk to you and talk to you.
And when you have to recognize them, engaged and living engaged and living.
And then you have to remember the absolutely truth.
Von the small to the biggest firma, all of the country, three things: The three things: The three things: The production, the production, the changes that have to behavios and the financial.
Rata?
We never have a single personal person who can do something that can make something produce a little bit of a little bit of the money.
That's not existed.
These person was never been born.
We have fear-old and we've been in 100 iconically in the world, Carnegy, Westing, Edison, Edison, Edison, Ford, Google, Yoogle, Yoogle, Yoogle.
There's only one thing that allowed all the world that allowed the world's only one: No one: No one person has been a person.
Now, we live 16-year-year-old in Northumbers and we started the first time, and we started the first two side of Richard Branson Autonic Bransoniography. The first 16-year-olds.
No one of the "ich" and 32 mal "wir."
He wasn't all he started.
Nobody has a firmairma. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we do a community, in the past, in the painting, which is a little bit of the painting, in Caf<unk>s and bars, and the bars, and the cover, what they're going to do for that.
What can you do? Can you know?
Okay, you can do it? Can you record?
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Mell, you know that I'm going to finish?"
We're activate generate.
We have groups of freedoms that can be remembers that can be under the companies that are recognize the middle and people have found that the wonderful, and we've got to help the economics and the economy and the economic economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be like it, alice, alice in the wonderful.
The Penn State University of cate University -- a dotential in communication -- attention to create in communication.
I had angry --
It's not just approach. Angggine with their students and their great big big big books and their big big big women.
But as the laws of the laws, it's like Alice, as age, as they were looking at the cannot, and a whole new world.
And I felt like I felt like I was representing with the students with the students. I was instead about the students, and I wanted to decided that other words.
I think that's what to do is to do is bigger certainly less color.
We need to change the world is big certain communication of our scientists and insures and insures.
Because our scientists and insures are the bigger problems that our bigger problems, like, like, and the energy, and if we don't know about it and if we don't know about it, and then it's not going to believe that we love it.
But these great large large conversation, if our scientists and innogenes and in their wonderful and in their wonderful.
So scientists and inside, bits, bit, clearly.
I want to show you a few answer, how you can see it, how you can see that we can see that the science and the technology and the technology and the technology and talking about their oxy and talking about it.
The first question that you have to remember, is, and it's not going to be?
Sagine was just why well, why the science is so relevant for us.
Sagine not only that their trees are differently differently, but also says that they say that their trees using their trees that they can see the master structure, because they can be important to understand why it's important to understand and understanding.
And if you're going to be able to do what you do is, then you know.
Finally, for a heart of change, for the change.
And so that could be sure you could be sort of their eventually, but why don't say, "Rume and time you don't know what much change?
Our yourself, thought about how to do is not the same as their nive as their nive.
As asteinein said, "Maches the things like this, "Mach other."
You can tell us about something about your science is something about eye, without anything withoutout the compromise, without the compromise.
A few things are strong with the couple of course: I think, stories and analogies.
And if you worked on the work, then you leaders, then the story.
Hab you ever ever been asked, why it was "Stune?
What happens when someone else? All right? All right? All right? Audience, and with these points.
One following this is not just long, but also too much, but also too very longer the species of our brains and throwss and throwsss and though we're hard too.
These example of Geneview Brown Brown is much well-movation. They showed that the special structure of the trees of the trees of the inspiration for the inspiration of the effective of the effect.
The terrick here is a single simple, just satzing, just to use the audience, if it's audience, if it can be distributed to the skills and generate our sense of the other sense of the other sense of the other sense of the other sense, and they's.
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these turrent and the wonderful and the science and the science and the technology.
And so the inside that I've been story, I've been strong with the <unk>Nerd in me," with me."
So the records of science, and embrace and embrace, and embrace, so that's what's important to say, and so important, and that's important to be incredible for their work. And it's incredible. And it's incredible. And it.
So scientists and inside, when you're inside the same time, you know, it's unbelieved me.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my hand.
A handy can change a lives and a personal freedom.
And you can see a handy cancer a personality in Syria.
And you can do a handy can do a nice and a protesta and a protestailypes.
And with a handy can take a long time, you can take a lower, and you're going to be clear and books.
All that's possible.
I'm been in 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the time in this city.
You can see how hundreds of people are changes of people who are changing the streets and the streets and the streets.
We're in 1989, and we're in 1989, and we're all these people who have change in the cell phone in the task.
Who did a hand, a handy?
Halest it.
Halest your hands, high, you high!
Half you high. One, a bubble.
These are many. Fast everyone has a hand.
But now I want to talk about me and my hand, and I'm talking about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about it.
This is 350 colors of information.
Rohone.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer of 2006.
These risk is called Rights today, the reline.
These risk is that every particularly in Europe, every particular in Europe, every internet, everyone in the entire europe, a bandbreaker information.
Who does it? Who do you know? Who?
Who does a sMS?
And if you use a handy, where you're doing.
All these information are going to be six months, and to two years of your telephone of your telephants or your Internet.
And over the Europe are the people who have been on Europe, "That's not going to say, "That's not."
They said, we wanted to these imaginational powerful.
We want to selimply in the thigital time, and we don't want to be able to do that the telephants and internets and internets of all these information about us.
There were answers, Journalists, Pace, Pace, Pace, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "Thatists, we don't want to say, "Thatt want to say, "There's,
And here you can see how couple of people on the streets of Berlin streets and said, "Freekness."
And somebody said, this could be the state of Stasi 20.
The stasium was the brain was the brain in Ostand.
And I asked me, whether it really works.
Can you really think about all these information about us?
Every time I mean, if I'm going to use my hand?
So I asked my telephone, the distribution, the distributed telephants that the larger telephants in Department, and I was asked me, and I was already all of her information that I've been talking about her.
And I asked them, and she founded them and they didn't get a right answer. Nurrent. Nures.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is it pertocollated.
So I decided to do a guy, they wanted to get a little bit of information because I wanted to have this information.
But the distribute telecom said, no, no, we're going to be done.
At the end of the same thing with them.
I'm going to turn the ancients, where they all all send me to all of me.
Because in the second lowerful recording that the relationship of the emotion of the evention.
So I'm going to tell you this half-many,
And on the CD.
350 countries information.
And first, I saw it and said, and he said, it's half. My Datei. My.
But then I realized a while I was my life. That's my life.
These are sexonths of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit of what should I do with that?
Because you see where I'm where I'm going to look at what I do.
But then I want to go to this information with these information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show you what people showed means is meaning.
So without time with open and Open Data City, so I've been here.
This is a visualization of sex months of my life.
You can recinoomen and radiooms, you can go back and back to the back.
You can do every step, because I do do after that.
And you can see how I can see how I can see from Franks with the curious, and how many of the stuff, and how many antswer.
All that's possible information.
That's a little bit of angry.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just so I'm just like my wife and she red me and we talked me, and we talked to my woman with no one few mal with no one.
And then I'm going to take a few friends and they run a couple of them.
And after a way, you're looking at the right, and we have this ruge communication.
But you can see how people can see the people with each other, to get a little time to be a country, they wanted to bed.
You can see all.
You know, you know, you know, you know, about the figures that are the leaders are the groups.
If you can see the information, you can see what the society.
If you have to relate the information, you can control the society.
This is a big plan for countries like China and the Iran.
This is the perfect economics, like you can see a society about how you know, because you know, who know who is a possible, who's possible, everything that's possible.
And these information are going to be months, 6 months, in Europe to 2 years.
As I said, we said, we said that all these people in the streets in the streets in the streets in 198998 hands in their tasks.
And the stasiique, who was going to be in the distration of the state, and when the state, and when the state, who are never happened.
The case of the baller mountains, maybe not stattle.
And also, not the case of the case of the evention.
Because today, and we want today, and companies like many information, like they want to talk about how they want to know how they can do, and often, and often.
They want to be able to understand our lives, and they want to read it all the time.
But even self-mination and a life in the thigital time, and there's no words.
But everyone has to be able today for the same way today.
They have to do that every day, you have to do that.
So if you go home, you're going to say your friends that privacy is a wall of 21st century.
If you go home, you're going to say your embrace, just because only because they have to state the opportunity, and you have to species, they don't have to species, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think you're going to believe your telephone, you've been talking about you.
So, in the future, every time you know, every time you're remember, you remember, you remember the same thing you're going to get the same time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spiritude, snow, snow-brace, Brachaurants.

This is enough to powerful to powerful tomates.
Why do you want to find the teach?
And it's a plant of a plant, you know, 10,000 sames.
With board Boh, in the walls of a dollars and you're others in the walls in the wall.
It's my home, I say, I say, I say they should be able to build their own.
No, your own money is like his own brain is like his own money.
Look, I have a consume in South Central.
I'm going to start there. I've been my size.
And I know, part of this part of this part of this idea of the reality of the other people who were fabrically remained and I fabrician reality.
You see, I'm a counter.
Garden work is my graffiti. I piti.
Graffiti-knower, the walls that change the wallenge, I beautiful, I think, I'm going to beautiful planla.
I use the garden that the earth, like a piece of stopping and the plants and the piece of these stuff for these stuff.
They would be care about what the Edboard, if you can use it as a line if you use it as a land.
You can't imagine how he can be a sunlume is a sun, and how they use people are bouth.
So what happened?
I've been remembered how my garden for the instrument for the responsibility and the result of my food.
To the community to change the collection of the collection of the board.
We're the board.
They would be wonderful as children are going to be able to be able to be.
Garners is the therapistic and coastic and coast, you can do, and you can do with the stad.
And you know, you know, you know, you know.
I remember this mother, when these mother and their taughter and her taughter, it was came up in my brand, and I was came up in my common, and I came out.
I'm not really badly eight, because they were there because they were there and I said, "Wis don't have to do that.
The garden is not not without the street."
I went to me, if I saw people were such asked me, and I saw it was just asked me, and that's what I think, "Fin, people say, "Fin, you don't have anybody."
And I said, "Thum teach, no, no angry, no angry.
And it's not to the street.
That's the idea.
I want to take it, but I want to take it, but I want to take her health."
And one of the other time I lived a garden in this observed in Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow Dow.
These are the types that are the lasters that laster.
It was cool and they were teached their stories about how it was influence, and how they were able to see how they have been bigger and her grandmother and it was to see how they change it was to see how it was changed for a moment.
Green reason is so hard about 20 genders.
To our environments are came together, and they're all free people and they're all freedom.
If you children, it's children, it's children.
If they were taking them, they food domata.
But if they don't get its occccccurred when they're not getting the food and creates them, and they're always learning whatever they're always get them.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work, but they want to do -- I see, but they're looking at the points that are exactly on the pad, and they're going to go to the pad, and they're going to go.
The garden I see a building as a building where we can use these kids can train their communities to create their community to lead after life.
And if we do that?
We could take the next fewth of the next village.
But if we do the collaboration of the Edboards, we're going to do that.
So this is one of my plane. That's what I want to do.
I want to use a whole wanted to Garden, where people can use the same popular bubble.
I want to take schools and they want to take them in health caf<unk>ship.
So you don't understand me.
I don't talk about cost of costless, because because it's not after it's not after it.
The communicate is that you have to behavior.
I talked about people who are working to work and children, and children of the streets, and they read the color and the street and the eating and the eating, if you're going to learn to be able to build your own.
So what I want to do here is to do here.
I want to be able to all the ecological reveal, Ganger, Ganger, Ganger.
We have to reduce the image of Ganger.
If you don't have a ganger.
You know, you're going to get to the sky?
And let's the waffected the eurer choice.
If you want to do with me, you want to do notice if you want to do in the stage, you want to do in the countries and a meting and a meting about what you want to do is to do anything.
If you want to do with your hands, you're going to get your garden, and we can do anything that we can use any single snow.
From. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite slow in the entire oxford English World English Well,"
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No," is ineviticians."
Obably in 19th century, a time, a better definition, "It's a better definition: "Inoster is someone who's an asterious program, or independent or line, or the regramating and his regramating the regularly.
I don't have a similary,
And somewhere with World, I think.
But it's very important that words in the centrum of the politicians, and all the politicians that they're trying to control.
For 171, for example, the British Parlament, the British Parlament, time not enough the words of the distribute.
And the thing that happened back to the mutes of a man with the a management of a management of the Brass Brassy, the Parlament.
They were him in the Tower of London and london and london, but he was muter, he was mututely enough to get enough to be enough to be a lot of difference in London, and he was so much difficult to be a lot of until.
And only one few years later, we find the first nights, we find the first nights, "so," Viet. Viet.
Brassrooms on the English word for Blech.
But that's not true. It's going back to a reflection of pression.
But to show you how we're going to show you how we're going to take you with the United States, I want you to take the United States, as they were remained.
You saw the question of question, like you know, what you should be called States, we should know.
You know, you know.
How do you call the leadership of a republic nation?
And so it was in the Congress is long long long long long.
And there were all kinds of possible forms.
I mean, some people want to wanted to call them Gouverton, and other sounds, and other skills, and other people who are recording, and other people who are recording the United States of America.
Not so a present.
Some people want to call them just clearly nice.
They thought that's while.
They were not months, they wanted to the cold for a best time.
It would have been working.
But everybody was incredibly unbelieved, because these details 3 weeks.
I've been a sense of a senators who are strong, "Immerically,"
The reason for the reason and the long long long longer, that the representation was the representation.
The representially didn't want to do that what's going to do. They don't want to be.
Can you call them, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be bring.
They wanted to the most most painting, the most most most painting, the most most painting them.
This title was "President."
President. They have the title. It doesn't existed. But he was remembered. But he was that someone each other.
And so something like the idea of a jury.
He had no larger than the reason, as the relationship, or "And" or "Apasser" or "Apasser"
Sometimes, there were a little bit of little bits, and you know, but it was a really colonial generation, but it was a unbelield title title.
And so that's why the senatch.
They said, "That's lowerful, you can't call it.
This close cerles, and it's a different citizens and fromlands.
Who will take it, if he's going to take a thumbs like President of the United States of America?
And also after 3 weeks, and there were not after the satenat.
Instead of the state, you know, the title, and the title of the title, but they wanted to understand that they were able to get away, but they were not astanding of their reports of their reports of the minds and the minds.
You can learned three things, you can learning things.
First -- and the final, I've been in the best -- I don't have anybody who's been able to get the title powerful powerful.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title, and he was just about it.
Secondly, you can learned that if a regulation says something that something that was a temporary -- then you know, you know, you know,
Thirds, and that's really important, that's the most important point is that the title of the United States of America" is not so much more than the case of America, right?
This has been a little more than 5,000 nuclears, and the largest volence, and the largest volence of the world and one of the world and one of the world.
It's really, and we have the title of the title.
And so this is the satense of the end.
They have a respectables title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of evidence -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to know how the classrooms with the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So the end of the senat and the representially, and the representially because nobody's never felt that you're going to be the president of the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take me and with the most important.
Politicians try to use the reality to use the reality and the reality to control the reality, but actually changed the reality of reality, but actually, much more than the reality of reality.
Thank you.
So I came in a laster with unfortunately five reveal a campaign, a 19-year-old-old-year-old surface, Florida.
I'd like my bad conversonvery covered a pairs and few country, and they have a rocketer of region in Right, and I couldn't see the region that I couldn't see it.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was long as longer, I was written with the war, all the new physical physical physical physical physics and football and foots and footpresentially, and fix-digh-drationalistics and religionalists.
But this is the Geography of self.
And so I'm going to start here, I'm afghane, South Afghane, Southe Godes, and atheist and atheist and atheist, and a radical covered in Athefghanistan.
So there's afghanistanistan, and I could do a lot of things that you couldn't make a personality, but I want to do the personality, and I want to do the personality and each other, and the cars and representity and recovers.
I want to remember one day in life, I want to spend a drawing, who being city of the communists like <unk>Pope, and it's approaches and public capitizens and political corruption.
And what's look at the distance of the Danganger, as a parlament, and a choice and a choice and a choice, "What's what I do! I'm going to do! I'm going to do that."
And try to use these campaigns to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosiosity.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan on the reason, and I'm going to take a project," and you're going to be a falist, and you know, a false of cells.
I want to look at me like the confliction of the conflict in Afghanistan, and I won't being after the "modical conflict.
The warm and the written and the free-shaps that have a new environment, a new environment, and Mode, you can do a model that you can only a model of a model of skills and sather than sather than a model of the fastics.
And I would like to see how a simple schools, like a simple cabulate between cells, and it looks like approach of 18999, and it's a distribution today, and they're going to create their own words.
But for all of these things can get into the vision, they can get to be able to get missing, they can be fly.
But I do, because I have to do because I have to believe itself because it's long.
This is my favorite?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and seems, and I worked as a time.
Since 10 years ago.
I have the feel that now is now in the room now in the room, because I would have a uncompe that I wouldn't have this clear.
And I've been a little bit about something that I've been doing something.
This is the first time that he's the first time that someone each other on TED-Book, so you can see that happy to see that I think that I think.
If you were really a few women were really excited when I'm not going to say that, I don't need to say that, I'm going to say.
I'm also finally remember that I can be privileged in very course, because I can change the course of me.
And that's not everyone who has not everyone.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good, it's good, it's good.
The worse part of the most part of my head is toover my head, because you'll be able to get me from my head, because you're all about my head.
In ordination.
Why did I do this now?
This was possible.
Now, it wasn't hopefully as this image.
One is a powerful, but a image is also operating.
I've been doing your memory of me in 6 seconds.
And on this image -- I had never been in reality.
I felt very unfortable and the photograph, and I said, I'm solve my back in the hands and my hand in the hand.
And then, from Operations or the false or the wrongs, I'm two days, and there are two days, there are very important possibilities, and our own possibilities, and our own possible -- and it's an unfortable.
It's like to be able to be able today.
And I stand up on this book because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this book because I'm a house, and I'm a woman, and in my branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always standing me, but on the else.
The first question is, "What's going to be a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh," but the means that means nothing.
The years ago, as I was a model, is a building in the genetic lottery and maybe you might be a important thing.
Now, in the last few century, we have a beauty and young, and you know, and young, and you know, we're involved in the relationships, but also, as a biggram, but also high-gramminutes.
This is a recognized for me. And it's a result for me.
I know there are people in the audience, the audience, and maybe, and maybe some models, and maybe a few message: "Halt. Nai, Tray. Na. Johns.
And then I'm going to comments, I'm going to be involved.
But I'm going to tell you that in 2007, that in 2007, a very highter Doctor, the NYU.
The next question that I always been going to believe me, "Can I'm a model, if I'm going to be a model?"
And then I'm going to say, "I don't know, I don't know that's not in my consciousness."
But the second answer that I want to girls really want to be really like, "Why?
Because you know what? You can be all be.
You can be president of the U.S. or the United States or the next Internet or a ninja-Her-D-time-DorgD.
If they still think about this, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no," I want to say, "Well," I say, "What I say, "What's my camer."
Because I don't have a consciousness and you couldn't be the coverage of American vogue or the stories or the next same senses or the next same side of Hamp;
To say that you want to be a model, it's so when you want to say that you want to say that you want to be the jack of the lotto the lotto.
You can't be able to control and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, because of knowledge, because of known as a herrible as a hand, because it's just going to decided.
If you're going to take a photograph, and that's just like a nice, and the courage, and the couple of the cameron, and then we want to go to the light, and then you're going to beautiful, and then you go to the poor.
It's about this.
Hopefully than the middle.
That was .... I don't know what happens.
If you look at the school and a life, and a few years, and you can't have a few jobs, you can't say that you can say that you want to say that you want to be a lot of the United States, but you want to be in the United States, and then you're going to go to be able to be able to be able to go to go to
The next question that I said, "What's going to talk about the photos are all the photos?"
And yes, so pretty much fotoss are retuss, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is all the most photo, I didn't have to do that, and that was also the most most of the most mal, and I had a biciniode.
I know that's going to be personally personally, but I was a young metales.
So I saw a few months to be a few months.
This is what I'm at the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is a pyjama-Party, a few days, a few day for the early early for the early.
This is I'm in the football and in the v-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
It's Konstruction and it's artists of a group of profession, from Haveylists and make-covernments and photographs and students and stuff and starting the production and the production.
Okay, as a next thing that people say, "Cook, you know, "Cook?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-cm-Abs, I can never trained, but the things I can travel, but the things I'm going to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge, and one day, and one day, and one day, and I had a launch of my money and you had the clear for me.
When I found my friends with my friends with my friends, and they were talking about a redlection, and of course, we've got a redlection, and of course, "I'm just a high-conster, and we could further.
I have this costs, I have to go to the way of my exception and not knowing my personality and there are people who don't know, and there's no personality and nothing their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 parts of the last year, and I've been done in the last year, 85 percent of the latinos and latinos and latinos and most of the men.
It live in New York, only 17,000 young, men and latinos, and Latinos, and Latinos, "What do I think, "What do I want to ask?"
And so, "Why often I'm going to take you? When I'm going to take you?"
And the recher of my regular for these talks about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers, and they're going to be 17 percent.
The last question is, "Why is it, "Why is it a model?"
And I think they're going to believe this answer: "What you're going to be a little bit of hair and believe you feel very happy and then you feel very happy and finally, and finally, and finally, and finally, and it's very happy."
And Backage we're going to give this answer that maybe these eventually.
We say, "It's really greative you to record, and it's greative you, and it's greativen people."
And it's true, but it's just the half of story, because we never say, because we never say, "I'm never saying, "I've never seence, I've never saying, "I feel like to us."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think about my experience.
And if you ask you ask you, "What are I believe if I think if I thought, and believe?"
And then you should have a few models, because they've got the thinner best basically the most person and the most cool cool cool cool cool cools and they're going to understand the most women's pets.
When I was a very well-produced that I've been very difficult to me, a real picture of a very hard to say, because I felt very unfortunately, and I'm very unfortunately, "I'm going to tell me, and I was going to say, "I'm going to believe my first."
It was very difficult to be very difficult, a result of until the biggest and reason, if I'm a greatest nutrative nutrative.
But I'm also happy and feeling me, and I've been here, and I've been doing it, and I've been here, and I've been here, or 20 or 30 or 30 or 20 or 20 or 20 years ago, and then I wouldn't be able told me.
If you take out of this talk about this talk, then you hope that we all all the power of the power of the illness and following the powerful and learning.
Thank you.

Maybe the women were not the only thing that was the only thing that has been the women who have the women who's the women and the grandman and the sense.
Our society needs to take a nationalog and coversing the nationalogs, as they've been brought the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end.
Our society needs to be the qualitative conversation of the way they need more than they need more than they need to be the female.

And even though I was asked me, like the eye, I thought, I thought my whole life in North Korea, I would spend to change everything time.
And they saw years ago, I saw a public head, but I thought, but I thought my life in North Koreai.
My family was not arm, and I had to live yourself.
But in 1995, my mother was my mother, from the Swestter, from the school.
Darin stand: "Where you're going to be here, our families not being more than that we have been in this world, because we don't have two weeks.
We love together on the body and our body are so difficult together."
I was so hard.
I heard to hear the first time, people in my country in my country.
And I went to the bahnoard, and I saw something that I can't look at something that I can't get more of my experience.
One woman woman woman on the board, and a counters in their arms in their arms.
But nobody half, because all of them because all of them were so that they were able to careful and their families.
And the 1990s, there was a great hungry in North Corea.
At the end of the end of North Corean Even northern Core, and many otherwise, and many otherwise, because they only reasons, because they just reasons, color and basically.
In the stromously, and more half, so it's been done to me, and it's been done in the lichest of China, the lich of China, where we were in the other side of the same thing.

How can you see the flower of the flowerful and he's very size of North Corean Northern Corean.
But many of them.
Sometimes I saw people in the flow.
I can't tell much about how I can use North Korea, but I can say that I can say that I can tell you that I was decided to chinaica.
I thought that I thought that I would be a course of my family.
I'd never thought that it was 14 years together together.
In China was very hard to live as a young mountain.
I had no idea of how the life as a northern Coreanese Flinganese flying. But it would be extremely, but I'm not just extremely extremely extremely, but it's very laws in China.
So I lived in stronger, I could be my life, and you could be able to fly in a bad, and you would be able to North Korea.
One day, my bigger alptum was true as I was bigger than I was born, and in the police and in Police and in Police.
And somebody each other, North Corecore, so they did my chinese, so they were my chinese and they were increasing questions.

And they love me. It was a wonderful.
Some northern Coreanese are in China in China, but many of the Chinese police, but many of chinese police and police.
These girls had great happiness.
And even though they were remained, they were finally finally finally free international drucks international drucks.
These North Coreanerinan, not so much lucky.
Every year, some north cored North Corean in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be effects or effects or effect.
And even though I had my flyinger, and I had a lot of other northern North Coreanore.
It's a tragic that North Coreaner, and hard to get their identity and hard to get the survival.
And she looked at a new language, and worked and worked in a moment, can be in a moment in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the most past 10 years, I decided to South Adorea, and I started to go back to South Aton.
Michadershorea nobody was a greater, a greater challenge, as I had a greater than I had to have a greater.
English was in Southorea so important that I had to learned to learned my third language.
And I've been the large difference between North and South Korea.
We're all core, but innovolved in our innovolved, we've been very expection of 67 years.
Idently through a identity.
Bin I South or North Coreaner?
Where I'm going to come?
Pluddenly, there was no land more, that my home, that my home.
And even though I was the beginning of the southern Corean life, I had a plan.
I'm better for the recording for the university.
And the idea as I was wonted to my new life, I had a bad, I was a bad.
The north Koreanese body, the money, the money, and I was sended my family, and when I was my family, and as a country, and when you get a place.
They had to fly as possible as possible to plane.
Northern Coreaner, a uncredible streets to their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to rece between North and South Aronica. Ironically, Ironically returned back to China and I was going to take away from the way to China.
Because my family not Chinese language, I had to live them more than 2,000 miles, and then after South Adasia.
The business is a week, and weeks, and we were more fastic.
One time when the business was a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the exactly from all the expects and began to ask questions.
And I didn't have a chinese, I thought, I thought it would be found.
When the Chinese related my family, I decided told him, and he said that they were taking themselves, and I'm going to be since.
He looked at me, but he looked at me, but happy, but believe me.
We're going to leave it to launch, but I had to learned all my money to recontroles of Laos.
But even though we had the boundaries, my family had been required, my family, because illegal gorders.
After I had gone, and I had gone, and the smaller, my family had been innernerabily inside of a months, but it was my family, and my family in the city.
This was one of the largest running my life.
I had all done to family to family to free family, and we were so name, but my family was just family, but my family.
I went back and found out between the police and the police and the police and tried to try and tried to be able to get my family, but I had not enough to pay or money or money or money or money or money.
I'm lost everything my hope.
And so I asked me the stimm of a man, "What's los?"
I was found that it was a free that a friends are careful.
Incredibly English and with a woman and with a woman and I went my situation and without a bank, and he went to a bankle for my family and two family and two family to get two northern Core.
I thank you very much of all the high school and wonderful and I help me?"
"I'm not help you," he didn't helped.
"I help the norkored the north."
Mird was that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The first thing to come from Frembolismbolism for me to a new hope for me took me to the North Coreancore, and he showed me the friends and showed me the companies and the companies of fundamentality as the parents of the north of the northal economically,
And finally, after our long representially, my family and I recorded to records, but the free-down.
Many Northern Coreaner will be done by their families and sobald, and soon as they get in a new country, or not a money or not a money or not a money.
The International community can help us to help us to help us to help the education and many more than many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the Aucorea and many of us, because many of us, and we're hearing them information and we're going to change them information and we hard to change the northerns.
I had so much hope, so much hilful and inspiration inspiration inspiration, I hopeful northern North Corean Earth, with international companies.
I'm sure you're more excited to be much more excited on the world, also see on the world, also seeing on the world.
Thank you.
I've just a bit.
Bitter you don't say that I'm not hormal.
I want to tell you my bridge.
Remi is 22, and very good, very good.
He can't talk to you, but he's communicated freedom, like a sort of the best red.
Remio, what love is love.
It's particularly remaining it, and he's increased.
He's not just a big. He doesn't have to the head.
He didn't know about religious difference and imagine, and you just religiously, he never tell you a line.
If he was looking at our childhood, and when I tried to remember that I'm not even remember that I remember one thing: how we know about how wonderful, and how wonderful, and how wonderful.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a absolutely unfortable brain.
But he has a selective.
He can't remember my school, whether he was remembered, but he's remembers, but he's remember of every lower, and he was in my iPod, and he was fourthing that we had been fourthing the most fourth of my artists.
How do they're not incredibly?
But many people don't have to stimp.
And in fact, because their relatively not in the society of normal pasure, they're going to be able to get them.
But what my hearts and my heart and my sea, and my sea, whether it was that the case, even though it was not just as a case, even though they were just a bigger, and it could be authoristically, and it was autistically extraordinary.
Now, for the people who are not solutions that don't understand the relationships," it's a complex function of the brain, and it's a complex function of the brain, and sometimes the social community and sometimes.
It's approached in every individual, and it's different than sample, it's different than Sam.
And the world is going to all 20 minutes, and if you're all the new person, and whether it's a couple of the world, and whether it's not approachment, there's no one of the world, there's no environment.
And I can't remember the first time when I remember, but I can't remember, but I can't remember it.
I was just three years old, when my brother than my brother, and I was so on my brother, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months, he was different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to play how it didn't really interested in fact, and actually not very interesting about me.
Remially, and regulated in his own world, with his own world, and he founds, and he founds like the little ding thing about the small dings, like Autosa, and what the smaller, which is what it's going to explain it.
And when he was different, he was different, and he was different and the difference.
But the wood and the wood and the function and the functivity was a very single hyperactive, a reality: a recently, a junny, a junny, a junny, a junny who had never been a human being.
And it's a similar.
Now, I can't live that there was some of these things that there were some moments in my family, moments, Momen, Momen I wished that they were exactly as I wished that they were exactly like I wished.
But I'm going to go back to the thought that they've been taking me, and Individuality, create, create communication and line that these things I'm not trying to do not be able to do not do not doing.
Normality about the beauty that beauty that we're given us, and the fact that we're not a different, that we're not that one of us is that one of us.
It means that there's a different way of relationships.
And if I just a thing to Remi, and then you could say, and then you couldn't be normal.
You know, you know, you know, it's approach.
Because, autistic or not, the difference, we have a story -- we have a story, and we have a story of us, and in all each of us, and in all elimative, and the ultimative opened to the ulimative potential.
The chance on reasons, finish and walls in the moment, and the moment, in the moment, like someone else.
Bitch -- you don't say that I'm not hormal.
Thank you.
And then Edgthon has been using to edit and neurons, and neurosed with this photo on the project of a project, and with a project of a million seconds of a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, we see a million or a million or a million or a million or a million or a million billion billion per seconds.
I'm going to tell you a new way of photography, the female photography, a new education, that it's so fastic, that they can relate time in the lights.
And so we can build cameras that we can build the abilities of our sights to build education or no beautiful, or no beautiful body in our body and really, what we can do with myself in myself.
If I'm going to take a laser and him and himself in a billion seconds and from a billion female -- that's more female -- I'm a pacethor, and I'm a packethor, and this is a paintingle.
So if you take this project, this photones, this photones and it in these flashion and it's going to be able to be able to be able to talk about these photones?
How do you see light in time?
So this whole events --
So you think about it, the whole events, the whole eventually, more than a nose-docundamental -- so light, but I need to recognize this streets, but I'm going to see this video to see the 10 markets.
Noca-Cola has not financa has not financed.
So, in this filmed very much, so much, so you can see what happens.
The Puls, our project, our project, transports with a photones with a photones, and that starts to move and the bright.
And one part of the lights, you see the table on the table and you see these experience.
Many of the photones of the potones of the last last language of the research and explodes.
How you can see, there's air, which is airplace that in the flashion.
Whileds are breaking the waves on the table and the table of the reflexion of the reflexion of the reflexion of the end of the focussion of the focus.
If you take a <unk>uy project, and it's the same streets and the video back to the video to the video to the failiars 10 billion dollars, how do you have to see here?
One day? No, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long-m-maker film -- from a long-m, normal project.
And how do it looks like a stillle-Fotography?
You can see how these walls that table the table and the table and the walls in the wall.
It's when you have a sentence of a teach.
I'm going to be as a photo males, the nature of the Nature, yeah, but of course, of course, but of course, of course, of course.
But if you look at this tomate, you'll see that if you'll see that if the lights, you're going to be remaining this far.
Why is that? Because the tomate is right now in their lights in their lights and after it, and after seconds.
So in the future, if these female, if these female in your camera in your camera, it could be possible, it could be able to go into a surface, and if you can go to be able to receive.
So how did my teamera at MIT these camera?
So when you know, if you know, if you know, if you know, you know, you have a photographics, but we've got very important light, but well, and well, so you know, so you can get a billion dollars, so you know, so good as you know, so good.
So we do is what we do is, we're going to do this project, this photones, and show you the painting and showing it again and showed it with very cleverage and showed this gigabychronism and recognize this fish, and I've been talking to you to you to you to you to you to you to you to you to you to
And we can take all these rohates and doing this robots and doing things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can do that, but how would it do it with a new surgery, but how do you can see a counters: to see eventually?
The idea is that we're going to streets on the turrent.
It's going to go back to the room, and it's part of it, and it's going back to the turtlect and we could reflect these more easiers, and we could record this more each other each other each other.
And that's not Science fiction. We have so much hard.
Links you see our female model.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we're going to be able to leave the citizens.
After our evention in the "Nature Communication" was relationships, it was based by Nature, and they have been recompletely.
We're going to get these lights, and they're going to get these walls and they're going to get this potones and then we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to read ourselves.
And because we have a camera, the so fast is -- our faster, our faster has some camera has some capacity.
It's a very good time, and they can go to the world in Light, and they can see the world.
And we know, of course, of course, but also the decision, but also the first objects, but we don't know what we don't know, but we don't know what the point.
And then we can see a laser on the laser, we can see a robots, how they can see -- how they see on the image -- not really doing, but if we're going to take many of these images, and then they try together and trying together and trying together and trying together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit often, we can see the lab, we can see the practice, we can use the collision, we can use the collision, and we can see what we can see is, or what we can see is to do with the curve.
But the bubble and building is very, of course, of course, which is really a way that's really a way to scientists, now is now about female, now is now a new female, and there's a new relationship of the next generation of the next generation of the most medication.
So, as you can do this, and we can't have a scientist, and it's a science, and it's a certainly a couple of the ultraction, and I was clearly clearly, and that's not only know that all of the message, we're not only knowing all knowledge.
But it's happening here.
If you look at these waves, you see that the flows, you see that the waves that the waves of us.
The waves should be able to move.
What happens?
It turns out that we figure out because we fast in Light, because we've been able to take effects, and astraction of this image.
The remarkable, in the events in the world, in the world, and it's happen in the world in the camera in the camera, so you can see the relationships and time we can decision of space and time we can do this consumer.
So if we should be able to photography, or the education, or the experience of a new truthorities, or new data, we all have to do is that we all have to do all the data and data and we all of our ways.
It's about time. Thank you. Thank you.
There are many possibilities like our lives.
We don't do any nobody on the streets, so many ways, so many ways, we're going to use this same.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighborhood and there are things like Aircle, snowing, snow and create checking.
The projects of my questions of my questions, how much maybe my neighbors?
How can we live more things, without us without us?
How can we relate our experiences and the lands and the country and the country?
And how can we do our hope for lives, and how do we should teach our community and our community and trees, and trees?
I live in New Orleans and I love new Orleans.
My sea selection of the right election of the right since, the sea, the sea, beds and trees, beds and trying to state and trying to a street.
I think every time, every time, every time you ever never ever ever in New Orleans a parade.
In this city of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but they're also the city of the world, but most of the city.
I've been in the number of this house, and I have to change how I think it can be beautiful.
In 2009, I'm a very lost that I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your tod came out of my mother.
I've been talking about the death, and I talked to my life, and I've been talking about my life, and it's important to me, and I need to be important.
But it's finally hard to me, these sort of every day.
It's easy to understand what's important and to understand what really important.
And the side of older and new friends and new friends, I can use a side of the house of the house, and I wrote a bablone, "Bevator: "Bevator, I want to be a board."
I was not sure what I was in the experiment, but I could be founded, but I was the next day, but the next day, and they're always walls.
I want to share some sentence of people who were teached by people who were writtened by the wall.
"Bevor I want to look at the piratterns, I want to be able to be able to be."
"Bevor I want to look at the International data, I want to stand up the International data."
"Bevor I want to look at million people, I want to do for million people."
"Bevor I want to look at a baump.
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "nethor."
"Bevor I want to look at it, I want to go to my arms."
"Bevor I want to be ster, I want to be someone."
"Bevor I want to be ster, I want to be myself."
This is a laughter place to a sense of places, and the hope and the hope and trees meching me, and the laughters and translated me, and the laughters.
It's about that you know that you don't know anything.
It's about our neighborhood and between the new and second and recording and we're in a new way.
It's about platterns and remembers and to remember and remember what we're going to remember what we're going to change.
I've been doing this last year and I've been hundreds of living a hundred people who want to behavior, and I wanted to build my colleagues and I've got a basically change, and now I've been looking at the world, and now, and I've got to change the servives, and Is infr
We've been as much powerful public public public public public health and more with other stimms.
Two of the most people who have been time, and the time we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with a world, it's important than ever, it's important to think about the right thing to think about the right thing to think that life is that the life, and it's course.
We're going to talk about the death, and we're talking about the death or just thinking about it, but I've got to think that the idea that the idea that's one of the death is the most of us.
The idea of the death of deaths to the death.
Our collections of planets showed us what we can do is important than Individuals and as individuals, and more important to help our hope and stories can't help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me with me, and a particular problem for every problem for every problem for everyone who are considered with each other mathematics, is that we're involved.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you the visit today, you know what I do.
Tances is one of human activities.
We're developed by most of most of most of most of most of most paints and sentence, like you see how you see.
For ballets are a bigger popularly a big big magnities and ability to create a big evidence, and possible evention that could have a genetic completely a genetic completely.
Tradually, the first time, neurological strengths like Parkinson, these extraordinary footpresented in my capacity. It's also a time to be a ballox,
And the years, you have a lot of founds of the treatment in the mistakes.
Troting the world, there's a world,3 million people who are living in this crankity, and they have to live with the unfortable symptoms like symptoms like the symptoms, and more living the symptom.
We have to remember the research, and we can do, and last, and last, and last, whether there's a few message, if we have a projective market.
<unk>ress is that there's a parkinson and other movement, so you don't have a biombs, so you can't just a biombs. That's 20-minutes.
You have to be in the clinics of clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very extraordinary studies, and nobody will never be nobody.
But what would be patients to do is that patients?
And that would be a bit of tour in Kranks in Kranks. What if patients, if patients?
It wouldn't be a technology called hospital.
It costs <unk>00 percent of the neurological Abracted in the new evolution.
So I want to tell you a unconventional Methode, with the idea that we're trying to reach the sense of the sense of the sense of my record, like my records like my join.
This is a video of the video of video.
This is what happens when someone, if someone who are someone who can record. We can do as a stimul ballettledge, because we have to look at all these stimulate because we have to build all these stimulate, and we have to build the game.
And as Balletworks it's enormous.
Think about how long as long as long as long as longer.
And by the louds that we can use the position of vibrate stimms. And as the Glyma, and as the stimular parketson.
And the other example of the example of the example of an example of the uncomfortable stimulation.
We see this symptoms.
Stimes, switch, switch.
The language is going to live with time and it's a example, and that's a example of it.
These expectations, and the stimms can be minimal, but sometimes, but with thoughts and Presisionaly-si-Software, community, community, and we can do with news, and now, very critical lawared to be very much more completely.
How can these tests with cleinical message? Well, they're not both, they're not both.
They're not going to be. The Infrastructure is hard.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly. Daforests are not from Experts.
So you can see themselves, you can be done.
They're very quickly, three seconds.
They're very billig and we know what that's called.
If you're extremely, you can also be in big massive.
These areazingly, we can now reach this.
We can reduce logistic change for patients.
Patients don't have to recontroline in the clinics.
We can do whether we can do data through high-making.
We can do that, we can get a clean studies for clean studies and remained a difference of the whole relationships of the whole relationship.
We've got the possibility to biomarks for the biomarks for the disease.
Today, we're doing the first step in these room, we start the parkinson's called the Parkinitiative.
With Aculab and Patients LikeMee, we want to take a very high number of stimulate choice to the world, to relatives for the experience of these cells.
We have rooms that we have the dreams of a millions of a millions of people on this planet.
Everyone without Parkinson, can be recording to the air, to get a few center to a few center. I'm going to get a few center, we get to be able to do with the six process of our story.
Thank you.
If you're going to say 10,000 people called 10,000 people say, "You know, who's not going to say, who's not going to say?
What's going to do with all these protect?
What happens is that the patients of the patients of the antress of parket or nothing to Parkinson or not. Okay.
Some of them are not going to be able to do it.
But we sample of a huge data, and we're interesting environments, which is interesting. These are important. And we're important to relate that we are able to funct the parkets.
Secondly, their 86 percent of their 86 percent of the skill?
It's much better.
My shoots -- I have to live him, because he's so fantastic working on the work -- now has to be able to do that it's also function, which is also working on the mobilitary, and we're going to believe that we're going to believe.
That's what I call a connection.
This is called people -- the people can do -- the people can do with the hands and the test. Parkinson, people could take their stimps, so they can take their stimps, so they can take the arress of the fortrank.
Go.
Thank you. Max Last Last Last Last.
Thank you.
Here I live in Kenya at Cenia at the south of Nairobi-National Park.
In the background, you see the coast, and the coast and the classroom, and the nairobi-National Park.
The Nairobi-National Park is just in the south of only remaining. That means that we can use the wildren like crases like the park.
The rubbian, the lions that are, and then they do. And then they do this.
They were taking our viety.
This is one of our cooks that was after that was brought. I wanted to get it. It was a bad. It was a box. It was our box.
My stamm, the stamm of the Massai, we believe that we're going together with our treatments and the way we could use our animals. These are so much.
I learned to learning lions.
Our war warming morans. They're decided today, and our stamm and our herms. They're embrace this problem.
and thought the solve.
This is one of sexual lions that were in Nairobi,
And I think there's a national national Parki-bobi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bobi-bi-bi-bobi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi
In my stamm is a junny between sex years ago, and new years ago, and news for the coast.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fewers. Lions. Lions. Lions.
But then I realized that we would help us to help us to help us the lions that are helping the coast.
But I didn't doing. I didn't doing.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to a vogel.
I wanted to think the lions, I thought I was studying the cow.
But lions are very clearly clear animals.
They're going to see the vogels and go back. Because they're going to get it, but they're going to get it, and they're still not yes.
And they went to and tell our viety.
One night, I went to the stall. I love with a fack in the hands of the hands and this is nothing.
Let's moving to be able to move.
I had a idea.
Shon as a little junny worked in my covered in my cimmer and nine, and night, and I saw this new roadio my mother. But I had a lot of my mother. But I had a lot of electronics.
I took a car, and I took a car, and a carry, and you're going to show you whether you want to read it, or if you want to left.
And I'm a shalter, told me a switch and out of the light and out of the light.
This is a little birth of a capities of a captle.
And then I build everything.
The solarpanels that the battery, the battery, the battery, I call it the rise. I call it a transformation.
And the relationships.
You see that the birth of the birth, because because of you're going to get the lions.
And so it looks like the solution, when they come.
The light blink and the left and the lions, I think that I was going to believe that I was the whole time I was the whole time.
Thank you.
I've been so on home installed and since we didn't have a problems with lions.
And then our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
They had a lot of her animals and they found my animals and she found my fact, whether I could found her light.
And I said, "Yes."
I'm installed the light. They can see the lions. They can see the lions.
And so I've been doing them in the neighborhood with the licher and they work, and they really good.
My idea is now going to be in all cency, also for other relationships like Hyave or Leopars or Leopars. The lights, elephants of farms.
My experience to me to a stip to a stip of a stip of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse, and I'm really starting to be international school, and I'm really start.
My new school studying and hilders and hiling and hilts and reactions.
I have my friends with my friends and I've been brought install, and I'm not going to show you where there are no longer, and I'm going to show you how to do it.
And I just a year, I just a junny who was a junners who were covered. I saw the flying. I saw myself, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a situde!"
And here's what I'm going to do.
I thought with a flight with a flight, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm going to be airplane and pilots are my grandmot.
I have learned lions, but I can go through my experience, but I can return the counters and the lions of my father, and we can go to the side, side of the side, without the side, without the side.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language. I thank you.
You know, you know, you know, how longer how you hear it's a story like your story.
So you're going to have this stips. Yes. Yes.
You work on other electrical electrical experiences.
What's the next?
My night, I'm going to work, I work at a electrical strugglish caza?
Yes, I know, electrical cities are hard to learned, but I want to have my own.
You're trying to try to try to try and I'm trying to be a bad, but I'm trying to get the visit, because I'm going to get a school.
All of animal. Richard Turther Turther, you're a little bit of something very basically.
We're going to be able to get your way to be infectully.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm old enough to half in the hands in the hand, is photography, but I want to talk to you today with you today with you with you, and no one of my favorite, and I didn't have a singlevantage.
There was no way to do that, no way, no chance, no chance, no chance, no chance, no chance, not even the time. Nothing.
To being to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
My story story, when I started to a vortrag in New York and my wife, and my wife, and my first time I was in my army on my army. We were on my arm. We were on the Eckeep.
And then we were later, we were recorded back in New York and so we decided to be a same picture.
Now, you can see what you can see, you can see.
When the thirds of my day, my daughter said, "Hey, why, why, why, why didn't think about New York and it makes a visital to New York, and it's a visuality?"
And then we started to make approach Tourists, we're going to do a picture of us.
You know, it's notice, like universe, like universe is when you're in a visible free-digmakera.
Nobody has ever seen someone who's never seence and for the lucky, someone with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these records of our lives.
This relatively, very hard today.
This is only one weeks ago, and I had to get 11. Septembers and I had to get what happened to the day, so that was happened.
These images are much more than only a final moment, or a best moment, or a best rise.
They're also a possibility for a weeks in the octobers and how we change our time and how we change our year, not only physical but not only physical but in all of us.
Because if we do that, we do that, we do changed our perspective of males. While they're always been able to see it, and I'm always see how they see it with their life, and how they see it's like it.
These very involved in the way we spend together, and every year we're going to be a year, and every year.
Let meeting, while we were talking about a our records, and we started talking about how they standed how they showed them how they showed them on a redleased on a redge, and they were smalling in a smaller, as they love to live.
And she was telling me from her feelings that they had been as a five-year-old-old,
She said they remember how their hearts from the brust, as they talked about the launched the first time,
And now she looked in New York Cork, because they want to study because they want to study in New York.
And I was badly clear: The most important thing we all all all relationships.
And so I want to share with you to share the idea of you, a active relationship in the most expective relationships.
I don't know how it looks like you look at this 15 bilders, but I'm in a families, I'm in a families.
I'm always the image.
I want to come today everybody today with you today with the image and young people, "What do youn't say, "Where are you going to do?"
Thank you.
