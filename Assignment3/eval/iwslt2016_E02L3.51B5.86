When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the cells of the cells.
My father than his body, small, the small Radio Radio.
He was very happying, what happy, what was happens, because of it was until the name thing that most of themselves.
He said, "The Taliban Taliban!"
I didn't know what it's going to do it, but it's very important, very happy very happy.
"Je can go to a service," he said," he said,"
The morning I'm going to do.
One of the same thing.
The Taliban, the might be the might be in Afghanistan, and I was six, and it was to go to the money.
And so I felt a long time, I five years ago, and I started to start my slowerful, not the more than anything, nothing to go to a simply, and you're going to go to a school.
So we could go to the same time, we're going to go.
Every day, we've got a different way, so we could never never getting where we could never.
We had told our books in Earth, and we would go to the book, but we would go to the same time.
Ourristory, we were in a house, 100 money in a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a small.
In the word was in the same thing, but it was in the same thing incredibly.
We all know that we all know that we've all of our lives: Lerm, and our else.
In the first time, the most important for a week for a word for a words because the talible, because the talible.
We were nevered, how much much about how much about how much about us.
Pold them?
Where they were where we doing?
We had to go to the angest, but we wanted to go to the same.
I had great great great in a family in a family in the picture of the picture and turned out.
My Greated his time, it was a father than it.
One of a situes from a provinced provinistanist. He's best, his test, my mother -- my mother -- and my mother -- and my father than it was father than his value.
My mother was brow mother, but it was line.
This is it.
To two years ago, they're just a house of our house, and just a women and women and women and women.
And my father -- this was here -- the first of his family, the first time, the first time.
For him, it was a children that his children would behavior, and also, it would be behavior, the test, all the talible.
He looked as a lot of a lot of risk of the risk of his children.
I know that I know that I've been in the days of the day, and when you're going to change our lives of our lives, and the personal and the personality of the positive.
I went told mean, I had told my father, "The said, "Theady, you can hear told me.
His Gelday can be destrop. You can be done in the couple of your hand.
But after after that's always going to be here, and what's going to do with ourselves, and if we're going to do with our numbers.
So -- you want to still you?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a land, I'm going to be able to be the country of the country.
When as a 66 percent of my women's age of myself as a six of seconds as a six, and if my family, and my family for myself, I'm also have a women.
States I'm going today, when I start here, as a strident of the middle of the middle.
When I was after the matter, I was my grandf, my grandmany, because it was the family because it was a turned to be a terrible to be a high school, the first time.
He doesn't just not just with my hands, but also, but I'm also also the first question that I was the first question, and the first woman with the carular.
My family family.
I have a great trees, but my family, but my family for me.
This is why I'm believe for 1010, 1010, a women for 10, a women for the women.
And so I've got to help, SLALA, and maybe the first time, and maybe a few maybe for a money, in a country, in a slight for the survice for the money.
It's why to see how the schools like the school of my schools with my slows with my slights of Chinances.
And to see how their else and value for them, like approaching my parents, and I've been decided to change the wrong.
So how it's not really being. It's not really, and I can't show you, but I can't show you the father of my father.
And then approached his months were on the head and he's been in their simply in their domining and they're going to be a bombs of the street.
When heart to home, it's a telephone and a stimate and a stimate, and it was farmed him, he would be trying to try to try to try to try to try to try.
And so he said, "The said, if you want to tell you, I want to tell you the future of my determined on my older, and I'm going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
What's what I've been doing something that I've got something that I've been going to be able to be able to be able to be the history of us, the victims, and the value of the father, and it's also being the terms of their own.
That's not going today that our mother mother, not a few mother in our experience.
These are they're highly highly, and the own and talking about a lot of a lot of their future, and they're going to be a distribution in a society of the society of the unfortunity of the uncility.
On the talible, only only only hundreds of money -- because it was ignore -- it was ignal.
Today everyone in Afghanistanistan million million million million million dollars.
Afghanistan, he's audience of America, so that's so different.
The American, how we're going to change our changes are social changes.
I'm going to change that the change of distribution and in the U.S.
But if I'm going to be in Afghanistan, when I'm slowed in my slow and their parents, and they're going to get a lot of the slowerful, and then I'm going to learn a lot of walking a lot of walking.
Afghanistan is for me for me, and the hope and the same way of the same time, and it's opportunity to me, and every day the best same thing.
Let's like I have a great death.
Thank you very much.
All I do what I do, I'm going to be my life -- I was boxed by the working of years ago.
In 1971, I've been seting, but it's not -- but I've been -- I've been in Soubia, the most early, the most early, and Almania, the African projects with African countries.
I have a normal ARORO and everyone else everyone, and every project that we're going to be able to be able to be able to be a project.
I was approached.
I thought, 21 years, we're going to do that we're going to live in Africa.
Instead of all, we're all of all we're going to do what we're going to do.
Our projects what he was, what my book, "Rep of the books of the campair," was a cameria, we want to show the same thing that we want to show the nambas, like the nambas.
We came withinalia, Sata Sata in South Adambia, which is in this talue, what's going to be a talian, and we live in the slimply, and we're going to live the animal and the tinypically data and the tiny.
So, of course, the answer is not author, so we're not a number of working for working for working for them, and sometimes they also.
We were instantly that it was solve in a book of lands of lands.
But instrating, she wasn't saying, "God, we're just saying, "God," we're going to say that we're going to say,"
"Govered the right now, the people who are recording the same thing."
Of course, all of all of all the Africa.
We had these practics, we were soldier. In the same thing they were so big such as a big such as a big.
We couldn't believe and say, "Sambamband, "Seah, like, like, like,
When the Tompa and room, and it was about 200 nights about 200 nights of the film and all of the family.
We said, "Onambs: "Oh, God, the namp!
And they said, "You know, we have no land here."
"Why didn't say that you're not going to be used us?"
I thought, we were just as a such as well, but then I was sating in Africa, but I'm going to do what I do do do that what do do is doing what I do do doing, what I do, what I'm going to do with our projects, I was going to doing in our project.
We felt the nest of the nest of the nervice.
They should see the difference -- you should see the university, because we're not translated the African people.
They should be the book of Abavid of Davison Moy Moyao, and it's a slince.
The Book was 2009,
We have change the African center of the African center, 150 years ago.
I'm going to tell you what this guys, what this is.
Let's just simple.
Let's from a African, what we've got to have.
We're important people are incial, colonists, and there's only two arguments, and there's two people, we're going to go to the patterns.
The words of the later of the later, "What's called "V"""
But they've two different different beds.
Patribe, I'm going to be a different culture of a different culture than my children.
Pronisisis: I'm going to be a different culture than my culture, as my dister.
This is why are going to be in Africa, "The Cheaw, Cheada,
I was went told, when I was like, "Shat's called "Seumbs" from school," he said, in all of the economic, if you want to leave them in the room, they want to leave them in the room.
This should be the first pick of the high.
The first practices of the hilf is Respe.
Today, the high-ron, the cron, this is a stables, and he went on the babies, "Canco, you're not a new start of new starts?"
When I was 27 years old, I was just to recording to remember, and he's never going to be a system, which is never going to be something that's never going to be a motives, you're going to be a personalistics, and you're going to be the personal personal personal personal personal personal p
What you do -- you're going to be the mundreds.
You're not going to take a guy idea with idea with idea with the idea of the simimimple.
We're not working from Brow.
We're going to do in Cafork. We're going to do in capability.
We have no infrastructure.
We're going to find fly and find out what the person who wants to do what the person.
The most important is the people.
You can make someone an idea of idea.
If you don't do this person?
The person for the own words of the person is important.
The posion for the own words is important.
We help them to find that science, because it can never be able to be allow.
The person with the idea of the idea of science, it's not approached.
A lot of years ago, I had this: Why didn't get in a guys to say what they do, and what do they do? But what we do we do not to do? But we're not going to do? But nothing?
Let me show you a brain.
There's a problem with Gemmances.
On the paint, and they're going to say, and they're going to say what they want to say what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they see.
Pancation has this blinds.
The cost people who cost the guys, because you don't know because they're not to make it.
We're working to do a to do this, to do this is a social infrastructure, but it's not existed.
One next board to be a new.
This is the house of the couple of the balls of the barth of the book, with you're going to tell you your head and in the century, and in the couple of your milities, information, in your life.
I've got this investion, Westralia,
I'm going to try to try and trying to try to tell the otherws where we should say what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and only through the street and he had three days of my first days. I've got told him. I was him in a married in a married in a married. I was a picture, and I was a picture.
I him told this fish fished together and this is not a fish, and I didn't have a fish for age for 60 percent of Cancoces, but Indian for the 650, "Carian," and I said, "Harmany."
In a year, I had 27 percent of the 7 percent of the region of the region, "What do you do that?
How do you do. I said, "I'm going to do something very switch.
I half the mundreds and him."
So -- -- -- the government: "Mo you're still it."
We've got a world in 300 memembers.
We have 40,000 companies are going to help.
There's a new generation of companies that are ability to understand the same.
Peterric, one of the best of the best of the best story of the story of the story.
Peterrically, Philosophy, and he was revior, and he was businessed with the parents. We said, "Ally, in the parents of a parention of a society and internal economics."
Plan is the test of the University of the universe.
So you're going to know what you know what to know what the most of human costs of human costs with their money and their money and their edge.
You have to learn how to do this this, you're going to get a to get a to get a to get a to get a to get away.
You have to tell them, and praction and praphics, you have to help them to help them to help them to help them.
In a guy of 10,000 people get 200,000 people, we get 200,000 people.

For the powerful parentation, most of the most of the most parents?
<unk><unk>ual, people live. The people have approaching.
I want to say that the untilique is the right way.
We're the first of the first of the first rich -- necessary -- never fly fossible, and the fully -- and there's not system -- and there's not after.
The recognitional mine is not after.
The Fron-Aron-ton-ton is not after.
We need to be able to see how we've got to recording today, and we're going to go today, and we can built with them, and we can condities.
The technologies of this exists.
Where's going to be the bigger for the large?
The region?
It's going to be approach them. And now now now.
I'm going to be a story in a story of maginistic magazine.
It was a group of eventually, the emothes were to the city of New York City in New York City in the best year.
In 180,000 years, and they're going together in 100 years, which was happened with New York City, the next year, the next year: The next next next next year, the next year,
Why? You know, you know, and say, and say, if you say, if the population in this tempected in this day, they need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Because they went in the monists.
180, they see the small technology, the neverage of nevers.
What happens? 40 years? America, 1900, in the U.S.
The idea, a different technology, a different rock, the road. It was a little babies. It was smaller.
The fear, Michel. Higry. Here's Fordord.
There's a brain, there's a box with companies.
When he had to do it, it's going to be able to be.
And the most of you're not talking about you.
When you have to be able to him, and involved, and live in the service.
Then you have to do that the truthority of the universe.
Fron the small, the biggest free, all of the large of the laws of the laws: The products, and it's to be able to be able to be able to behavior.
Right?
We've never have a same person who can be a same thing that we can make something producing a produces and the great money.
So something exist.
These person was nevered by the person.
We have founded fished and 100, and the 100 fished by the world -- the world -- Cargest, Couth, the news, the new fing, the new found, the new found, the news,
There's just a small, all of the world, the world's just a covered by a carry, only one of a person.
Now, we live 16-year-yth-yth-yth-yth-land-land-land-landards, and the first time that we're going to be two side of the same of the same of the same time. The first same thing in the same of the same.
Noice "The and 32 malth.
He wasn't always starting.
Nobody's a found of a firm. Nobody.
So we can tell a greatment, in the painting, the smaller, which is a little bit of Harground, and you've got your bars, and your bargledge, what they're going to do with this.
What can you? Can you can do it?
Okay, you can do it? Can you can do this?
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "My, I'm going to do you?"
We're going to be able to be able to be able to be.
We've got to change the free free of the university of the unlimate of the culture of them, and we've got to help them. We've got to help the words of the interviews of the interview of the interviews of the culture and the culture of these culture.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be where it's to be age where Althers in the wonder.
The psciate state -- a data -- a doment for me -- a domination -- in the incomics -- in Communication.
I had antribly --
Rightly antize. Att the students with their brain and their brain and their big big big big big big big big watch.
But when the laws of the laws, it's like age as age as age, and when they're going to be a new tiny and a new world.
Gen I felt like told me when I was felt with the students of the students. I was talking about the greatest of the greatest, and they want to do that other words.
I think that's what to do this tell, I'm going to be big cartartartartication.
We need to be increasing cartartartoics of our science and involved in the world.
Because our science and inside, and the interestings are the bigger problems like our problems, like the energy, and if we don't know, and if we don't know it't know what it's not believe that it's not believe that it's not believe that it's not believe in our non's not believe
But these great society, not to get our science, if our science and in the interested in their wonderful.
So science and institutions, and institary, and cary.
I want to show you a few antswer how to see how it could see that we can see that we can see that we can see that the technology and technology, and the technology, and it's talking about it.
The first question that you have to be used to be, and it's not to be?
She was used to know why we know, economically, society is so for us.
She's not only that their trees of their tells, but also says that they say that their tells that they can also, the cartartartartartocks, because they can under the opportunity to understand the opportunity to understand and ohere.
And if you're going to be what you do is what you do.
Forders are a high-strisisism.
Some of them could be a <unk>uum and course, but it was not simply not saying, but it was not simple, and what's not a lot of us?
Ourther media, it's not going to do is not the same thing like their name ways.
How do you're going told me, "My, but the things like this.
You could be a best of using something about something economically, without approaching without the comproment.
One of things are, there are a few years: Because of the example, and the analogies and analogies, and they could be able to be able to build their bures.
And if you're working on the work, then then longer, then the storp.
Habil younged her, it was "Shump," it's called "Spe"
What if you're going to be a different? It's going to be a different public, and that's the first public public.
One of the fold is not just longer, but also to be very such a very language of our brains and we're going to talk about our brain and we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
These example of Golved of Grove Brove is much much more than we show you that we show you that the structure of the structure of the terrible, so that they're so that they're not a signification of the signification.
The Trick is a simple, a simple simple simple simple simply, and when it's audience, if it can be audience, and when we can also make our milities and our others, and our others, and we're going to make our slow.
That's just a few antswer that we can help us to help us to see this tells and the science and the science and the technology and technology.
And the Instructure that I've been story, I've been doing with the same time with me," with me, and I want to tell me, I want to talk with a great definition.
So, the economic scientists are economic and evolved by the revolved by the revolved, so that's important, and what's important to be able to the multize of their work, and the economics. And society.
So science and instruction, when you're going to be able to build this great me me.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my hand.
One of life can change a few change and a personality.
Mituy can be a country, you can see a humanity in Syries.
Mitter a hybandy can make a network and a program, and a program.
And with a hybandy can be a long, it's highly house, and it's going to be able to be.
All that's a hype.
I'm a year, and I've live in Blin.
Let's go back in this time in this stad.
You can see how you can see how hundreds of people who are changed for the streets of people, and the streets.
We're in 1998, and we're going to be all of these people who are all the people who have change, and we change in the type.
Where in the sala has a hype?
Half you're high.
Half you're high-year-haps!
Half you're high, a back, a back, a back.
These are many fast, everyone has a hype.
But then I want today about my hand and my hand and how it's changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about followed.
This is 350, 330,000 information.
Rohata.
And why are these information?
Because in the same 2006.
This is the relination is called Rights, the relationship.
This room is that everybody electrically every particularly in Europe, everyone internet, everybody internet, a breaker, a breaker information, a bread of carration.
Where are you know? Who do you know, why?
Where's a smart of a small?
And if you're a hype, where you're going to be.
All these information for months are going to be two years of the months of two years of your telephone or your internet or your Internet.
And over Europe, the people are the people who have said, "That's not going to be."
They said, we want to do this expective,
We want to wanted to be in the digital time, and we want to do that we want to be the teledge and teledge and information about all of all of using all of us.
It was award, Journalists, Journalists, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to be."
And here can see how to see how to see how people are streets of the strongs and said, "Fratters, "Fratter."
And you say, that's so that could be a 20,
The Stasio was the brain in Ostantize in Ostants.
And I founded me, if I'm really working it really works.
Can you really really really, all of these information?
Every time I'm going to give my hand?
So I found my telephant, I funning the dominutom, the greatest part of the biggest part of the longer, and I was founded told me, and I was founded told me, and I'm going told me.
And I found them, and they founded them and she didn't get a name answer. Nura.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life is protoces.
So I decided to me, I'm going to be a greater, because I want to have this information because I want to have to have this information.
But the done whole part of telecom, we're going to be information, we're not going to be able to be.
Am the end of approaching with them.
I'm going to recording back to me, where they allowed me to me.
Because in the condition of the basically, that the basically, that the evention of the evention.
So he's what I'm going to be a collection of a CD.
And on the CD: this was this:
350, 330, 180s.
First, I said, and I said, and I said, it's a huge.
But then I recorded a way: That's my life.
That's second months in this life.
So I was a little bit of what I want to do what I do?
Because you see what I'm going to be where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to do with this information that I want to go to the sublicity.
I want to do you to do.
Because I want to show you what people want to show whatever.
So, without time, and Opline, and I've got this.
This is a visualization of my life.
You can recording and it can record and you can get back and you can go back to the back.
You can do any surpres, I do that I do.
And you can see how I can see how I can see how many found with the found of the found, and how many years ago, and how many of how many years.
All that's impossible information.
This is a little bit of a little bit.
But it's not just to me.
It's about all.
So, it's just like this, I woman and she woman and we talked me, and we talk to a few march.
And then I went to me a few friends and she's a feward.
And after a way you, and you've got to go and you've got this created a rometication.
But you can see how people can see how people communicate to come to be a time, they're going to go to the book.
This can see everything.
You know, you know the central figure, about the antrala, the grands are the groups.
If you can see this information, you can see what you can see what you can see what you do.
If you can take this information, you can have the society, you can do.
This is a bances for change like China and the Irana.
This is the perfect of the world, how you can be a society of society, because you can't know, because you're going to talk about a possible, and if you're going to be able to do this information.
And these information for months are going to be 66 months in Europe, in Europe.
How do I said, we're going told us that we're going to be in the street in 1998989898, in the high-h-hand-hand-hair.
And the strong, the strus, who's going to be the done who was the stration, and when the stuffer, and then the stuff, then you maybe that's not going to happened.
The faller of the baller maybe maybe not maybe not statters.
And also also, not the fall of the fall of the fall.
Because today, and so many of centures and many information, so many information, how many of us, and they can do.
They want to do the possibility, and they want to be able to learning all the longer.
But setimply, and a life, and a life of life, and a wider't a wider.
But everyone today for the same thing forms today.
They need to be a day, every day.
So if you go back to your home, you say that your friends that Privilphere's a year of the 21th century, and that's not age.
If you go to the home, you're going to say your fly because it's just a firms and possibility, because they have to do it, and they have to do it.
And if you don't think about your telephere, you're going to believe the information that they've been talking about the information.
So in the came time, every time, every time you're going to tell your handy, you're going to be able to remember that you have to help the skills in the time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Centraluitual, law, slow, brest, Burant, Brazant.

I remember that Rollowed to be able to be able to be as approaching like the world.
I'm going to be dyonderful as approaching like starts like street.
And I'm going to start that the body.
I capacity that problem is that the problem is.
It's the problem and it's the larger.
All of the last last last last 45-minutes, I had author to get a patterns to get a pized with the pization.
So I was a panced approached my house.
It's a stand, we call this parket.
It's 45 meter.
The thing is the thing that it's heard.
But you have to have to be please.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do it because I want to do it, and I want to half."
And I decided it in standing in standing.
So I came and my grand and my line. LA. Green, and we found, and we fing together, and we food, and we're going to be prediction, solve the programming programm.
We're a kind of sort of collection, and we're going together, and all of all the stories and all of the strong and it's free, and what we do is, and what we do is, and what we do is, and what we do.
And the Garm is beautiful.
But then you're going to be someone.
The stad of city and he was told me and he said, and I said that I said that I said that I said that my greatment, I had to be able to be a richard.
And I thought, "Kom, you're going to be?
One of the same thing about north of nobody of nobody on a standard of a stand, the egal?"
And I thought, "Cool."
Because this malth, it wouldn't go on.
The LA. Times. Times of the words of the last last language and talk about it and talk about the strategle and talking about a middle of memory, and you're a polities, and we were a 900900, we were approached with a 900,
We've got to change the high.
My strates, and she said, and she said that they're going to do what we love and what we do.
So, why didn't do that?
LA. It's been in the visities in the United States in the book of the stad of the stad.
They're best 62, 122,
These are 20 Central Park.
This is enoughly found, 75 million dollars of Tompan.
Why didn't do that they shouldn't find it?
And it's a panchane, you know,000,000,000,000 sames.
Mitary board in the window of a double of a double and yourself in the writing of the 75.
It's my head, I'm saying that they should be you should be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
Some of your own subject is how it's own gone.
Look, I've got a couple of South Couth Central Central.
I've got there. I've got my snow.
And I know, I'm going to be part of this recorded to be able to be able to be able to be founded my own relability.
Look, I'm a couple of a couple of.
Garmed is my Graffic. I'm going to be my colleagues.
Grandmani-pe-p-cluding, the wrong, and I think you know, I think about the parket and Parketa.
I'm going to be the garry, like a stopp, and the piece and the piece of the piece of these stopps.
They're going to talk about what the experience, if you can make it when you can make it as a land.
You can't even even asking how to do is a slumbon, and how people are people like, and how people are people.
So what happened?
I've got told my Garmany, like my instrument and the expection of my voice and the voication.
To the genemics to change the mustrate of the countries of the box.
We're the box.
They would be wonderful how children are going to be able to be.
Garman is the theraper, and the most capture, and you can do with the best of the stad of the stad.
All of the course, you're going to be.
I remember this mother, and I was this mother and their day, and she was after the 1030,000, and I was after my guys, and I was bad and I went to be skin.
I'm going to be sort of it, because she said, because she said, "What's not to do that.
The Gargest is not withoutout the street."
I've been going to be if I've been such asked me, and I've been highly, and it's just to do that, "Forry," that's not going to do you're not going to do you're not going to be approach."
And I said, "Whum, I'm not approaching that they don't know what they clear.
It's what it's not on the street.
This is the idea.
I want to do it, but I want to want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
At the other time I live a garl in this older, in this slimilar.
These are the type that's going to help the later,
It was cool and they had their stories about how they've been able to be able to see how they've got their mother and their mother and they've got to see it, and it was able to see how it was also, it's just a moment, but it's just a moment.
Green's so basically about 20 Garma.
For our engineering engineered, and they're going to free people and all of the fills.
If you're carly children, it's children.
If they turned them, they're data.
But if they didn't get them to get out when they get to get out when they get to get out how it's not going to be able to be able to be what you're always what you're always still what you're going to do.
I'm going to work, people who want to work, but they want to do this, but I'm going to go on this children -- I'm going to go on the pad, and they're going to go on the patterns.
The brain, I'm going to be a feward, where we can build this children, where we can build their children to be able to be able to behavior.
And if we do that?
We could next to the next brings Carbon Carbon Carved States.
But if we're going together the cover, we're going to change.
So this is a parents. This is what I want to do.
I want to do a very well-bocked on the garbon, where people can be the same ways.
I want to tell you, and I want told them in Cavior Cavior.
So, you don't understand me.
I don't know about cost of costs, because the most cost is not after.
The communicity is that you have to behavior.
I talk about this, I've been working and children and children and the streets and the folds and the streets and the streets and the streets when you get to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
So what I want to do is that here's what's going to do.
I want to tell you all that we're going to be able to be ganger, Germany.
We need to be the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a greater, you're not a greater.
Gangerously, you're going to be slow?
And solve the words of the words.
If you want to do with me, if you want to do you to make me in the squence of stuffering and a methor and you want to do something about what you want to do about it.
If you want to do you to get your book, you can get your money, and if we can do with my garress.
For. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my line, my later in the oxy of Oxford English English is "nostergynost.
Because it's so much.
And "nost-ynost-year-old "shatics"
One of the 19th century in 19thern, a basically a better distinition: "Egynost, "Egynost, the antically, approached by the post of the psype of the polic, or the polent of the psy.
I didn't have anything, "How's not approach.
Is somewhere with World, I think.
But it's very important that we're very important in the politics, and all of politics that they're trying to try to be able to try to do.
171, for 17, for example, thirds, the third parents, not the parent of the words of the data.
And that's what happy to the mother, the mutes with the mother of a mother named Cambraby, the cambraby, with the parent.
It was him in the Tower oftended, and he was a month, but he was author, but he was enough to remember, and he was so much more involved in a lot of later, so much later,
And only a few years later, we find the first time we've been able to the first satell of the first brought of the brought.
Brassroomss on the English for the book for book.
But that's not going to go back to a piece of the power of the practice.
But to show you how to show you how we're going to show you, and politics are going to take the USASA, when they're going to take the United States.
You know, you know, how to be asking about how to build the state of the stategober,
You know it's not.
How do you think about the antican nation?
And then, it was in the cress, included in the long.
And there's all of all of all of the possible.
I mean, some people want to wanted told them, what other surprising, and other sense, and other hands, and other people, and other people who are recording the free of the free of the United States of America.
Nothing a bit of a bit.
Some people want to wanted to take them.
They thought that's what's like.
They were not monistically, they wanted to the climate for a best time.
It's hard working.
But everyone was uncilible, because this is the data because these three weeks.
I've got the tell of a sator of a sator, "I'm still the same thing.
The reason for the reason and the longer and the longer was that the representation.
The represental sounds that the most important thing that doesn't want to be.
Can you're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
They want to him the most of the most, the most of the most painting, somebody who had a tell them.
This is "Pelf was "Prident"
Prident. They've got the tites. He didn't existed. But he was existing. But it's a valual valual valualual violit.
So something like a number of a Jury.
He didn't have more than the same as a relationship or "Ape" or "Ape"
Sometimes it's a little bit of smalleries and regular smaller and regularly, but it was a really university.
This is why the satell of them.
They said, "That's longer, you can't next psident.
This is a clearly to get approach and wrong and change the wrong change.
When he's going to take them when he's going to take a little terributed like Prident of the visities of America?"
And also also three weeks of three-dating the satell.
And in the came thing that you're going to go to the Trident, but they want to understand the carrident, but they want today, but they were not approached by the roads.
You can do this is interesting things that are interesting things.
He was -- and that's finally, I've been going to be able to figure out of the satell of the satters of the test of the tests.
Backack Obama, Prident, Prident, because he was just the telling. It was just like that the satively,
Twincious, if you can learned that if you say that, something that's a north -- then you've been talking about 23,
The third, and that's really important, the most important thing is that the most important of the test of the visities of the United States of America, but it's not more than the carry?
This has a more than 5,000 nuclearly more than the larger and the bigger and the bigger and the biggest of the world and approaching the world and approaching of this creates.
It's really trying to the test of the test.
And so that's the satell of the end of the end of the end.
They have a respective turned a title.
And the other sor of the same of the same of empartment -- it was so that it was so that it was so.
But you know how many nation, how many nation?
147.
Because they're all of the course, like the clearly 5,000 large,000 large,
So the end of the satell of the satell, and the representer, because the nobody who's never been able told you, if you're going to be the painting of the painting of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can do with the words and I'm going to understand.
Politics to try to try to make the relations to relationships and the relationships, but in fact, but the reality of the world, more than the world, more than the world,
Thank you very much.
So I came in a later, with a later, 50 percent of the campaign of the dimal city -- a year-old, age of Jack, a survivident, Jackackavid.
I'm going to be my couple of Calbon-ballery country, and I need a parent and a room, and a room, and I couldn't see the running of the recording.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistanistan.
She was longer, I was biggest, and I went to the new psychane and psychane and funny and family, and I'm going to helps without surprisation and the systems and the systems and the same-clow-conomicational pictional.
But that's the bography of the same.
And so I'm going to take here, I've got after South After South America, God of God, a politic and a few years ago, and a politicy, and the last year, the new last year, and the new years ago.
So there's a lot of Afghanistan, and you could do, but I could do not going to do with a personal remarkable, I want to do with the personality, and I want to do with the personality and in the personality and in the news and the news and the news and we're going to doing.
I want to tell you a distrible -- I want to be a dangerous distrible to be distrible, like the barch of the barm and efforts and efforts and religional political and political political political political political political political sence.
And what's seriously can do the danger, as a parent for the parent of the parent and a number of the slight, and I'm going to do with the slight.
And trying to make these campaigns to make these magaiiiioss, as the national national national.
I want to tell them in Afgion in Afghanistan, and I'm going to go back to a project that you're going to go out of the policy, and you're going to be approached by the streets of the cars and the cars.
I want to look at me like the cronists in Afghanistanistan, "ghanistan Codon's called "That's after.
The carry and the freming of a news, and the came, a new came to the new collection of a new stuffer and you can just a new money, you can only a money for a money of slightly, and I can make a sata, and I'm going to have a collective.
And I would like to see how to see how a simple simple of carious cars of the 989898999, and it's a distina today, and the answer of the world,
But for all of these things can be in the building, they can get to be able to be founded,
But I'm going to have to be because I have to be the same thing.
This is my last. Where's your language?
Thank you.
Hi. My Name is Cameron Russ and seember a time, and I worked as a mathel.
Since 10 years ago,
I've got this sure that there's now here in the room of a uncility of the room, because I wouldn't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to do.
And so I've been a way to do something that I've been a way.
This is the first time that the first time that you can see that the TED-D-D-S-S-A-A-A-SED, so I think that I think that I think that I think.
Fall a few women were really, I've been going to tell me when I need to say that I need to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to tell me.
I also also also found that I'm going to be priviled, because I can't have a very countries of 10 seconds.
It's not to do any chance.
These are very sort of very uncomplicated, it's good, I don't want to be able to be able to be.
The first part of the most part of the pully is to be about my covered my copopopered me, so you're going to do you all of my carbon's not going to do my copopope.
In organization.
Why I've got to do that?
It was a piece.
Now, it wasn't hope, it's not like this picture.
One of the message, but it's also a idea is also, but also also.
I've got your memory of my memory in the 66 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been a friend.
I felt a very unfortunately, and I said, I said, so I'm going to be slow my hands and I'm going to be founded with this type.
And then, in the operation or the fal or funning the brunch of two days for two days for two days, there's very impossibility of our opportunity, and we've been able to change the surface -- and it's not afford.
For applosed today for me today,
And I'm going to be a math, because I'm a money.
I'm going to be a book because I'm going to be a house, and I'm going to take my brananch, and we're going to take a money.
I'm going to do the questions that people who are always stilling the way that are the way.
The first question is, "What's going to be a mathel?"
I say, "Oh, I was always, but I wasn't really good.
The later, how I was a mathemod, I was a building in the same later, and approach and maybe you maybe, and maybe you're going to be a best.
Now, in the last year, we've been a personality, we've been just as a person and youngric, and you're going to be programming, and we're also programmed as a biggram, and it's also hospitalful, and it's also highly hundreds.
This is a same for me for me. And it's a sure of me, and it's a number of me.
I know there are people in the public, the public, and maybe you maybe a maybe, and maybe a maybe. "Hey," "Heyma, Joymanio.
And so I'm going to comment, I'm going to be approach.
But live to you to tell you that I had to tell you that in 2007, a very land of the nobody of the Nododels of the lands of the less of the less of the less of the 7, and that's not only about 27,000 percent of the 77, or not only 27,
The next question that I'm always going to be, "K, I'm going to be a mathemod?"
And I was approached, "I don't know, I don't know, not in my distance."
But the second answer that I want to do this little bit of these little bits, "Why?
Because you can be? You can be all.
You can be powerful parent of the USA, or the next of the next of the Internet or a network, or a network, what you're going to be the first time."
If you're going to say, "No, no, no, no, no, "Namer," I want to say, "What's going to say, "What's going to say, "What's going to say, "What's going to say, "What's going to say, "What's going to say,"
Because I didn't have no idea and you couldn't have the Canaken the American or the American or the American or the history of the next money or the next money.
To you say that you're going to be a money, but you want to say that you'd say that you're going to say that you want to be a line.
You can't be able to be fantastic and it's not a carratch.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, the money of scientists, because the surprising the hurface, but it can just to be able to recording.
If you're going to help a fours, and that's like a network, and the came, "Cell, and then we want to say, "Co," and then we want to go to the box, and then you're going to go to the point, and then you're going to go back to the point.
It's what it's like this.
Hopefully completely as the middle.
That was ... I don't know what happened.
If you've got the same and a few years ago, and a few years, you can't say, if you're not a lot of you say, if you want to say that you want to be a piece of the U.S.
The next question that I said, "What's going to be the fossible?"
And yes, so, so that all of foss are going to be a little bit of the small of the story.
This is all the first foot, I've been done, and that was also the first time, and that I had a bio, I had a bio. I didn't have a picture.
I know that's going to be a personal, but I was a few money.
So I'm just a few months of my months with my grandmother.
This is the day I'm going to this single.
My friends, I had to start me.
This is a pychiece of a pyyy, a few day, a few day for a potent for the fing of the fully.
This is I'm going to the fall-The and the vagina.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these bilders are not a bilder of me.
It's cruructed and it's a group of a group of profession of Hazyps and Mostlanda and mothists and potent and allower and all of their own and all the number of their numbers and the name.
Okay, as a next people who are always saying, "K, "Ko you're going to do?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-clude-clude-clude, but I can't be able to be the things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to get the live in life, and I'm not talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge and a day and one day, and I had a line and I had a law, and I had told me. And you've been to me to me.
When I found my friends, I found a friends with my friends, and they were talking about a room, and we've got a course, and we needed away, and it's just a wronger, and we could just asked a wronger, and we could be a wrong.
I've got this costs of things that I'm going to go and nothing and nothing my personality and there's not the person, and there's not a personality and not a personality.
I live in New York and 140,000 parts of the last year,000 year, and I had been distribed and they were films, and most of the last year and most of the line and most of the menginists.
It's live in New York,000,000,000, men, men's not going to be the woman who didn't say, "What's not going to do?"
So what's like, "What's going to do? When I'm going to do?"
And I'm going to be the running of these variety that I found that 53 percent of the U.S.3 money in the U.S. And they don't want to be able to be able to 17 percent of the 777.
The last question is, "What's a mathy?"
And I think they believe that they're going to be a little answer, "What's going to believe and then you believe, and then you're going to believe you.
And Back, we've got a answer that maybe the answer.
We say, "Es is really, so much more, so much more, and it's creative, and it's creative people inspiring, people living inspiring."
But the true is that it's just a history of the story of the story of what we called the story of the camera, what I've never saying, "I've got meching me, "I've got me.
And I feel like told me because I'm going to go to my day.
And if you're going to be fly, "What's happy when I think if I think if I think you believe?"
Then you should have a few money, because they've got the most of the most of the most of the most parents and the most of the most cool and the most of the most of their cool and they're going to go to the most questions.
When I've been talking about this, I've been very sort of me, it's a very early, because I'm going to be able to be very sort of me, and I'm going to say, "I'm going to say, and I'm going to say, "I'm going to tell you."
It was very sort of all, a very difficult of untily, and it's business and running the bigger than I'm going to be a narvious narved.
But I'm also believe and I've been able to help you, and I've got to help it, and I've been going to do this, or 10 years or 20 years organized organized, organized my collaborate, and then I wouldn't have to do.
If you look at this visual with this, then we're all the might be the might believe in the minds of the idea and following our follows.
Thank you.
I've got the word of my Grandmother great, the evention of life, "Shat's living in life, "Shatisti, Ghavior.

We need to remember in the names of the middle and the greatest.
We need to be a way of distribution, the fold, but not just asked to do not just to do not just together: So together, so that's also approach, a catter, a cature of course, a slower.
This is the ideal ideal, the idea that's a fully lawsy Life, to make farms to recording.
Because the frother has age and in this al al al al al almost of this is the same time, and minutes and minutes.
This is the real years ago,

Thank you very much.
When I was a little bit, I thought my land, and I went to the world, and I went to the light.
And I was very strong.
In the school, we're going to be the story of Islimate, but we're not very much about the world, but we're not very much about the world, and the America, and our fly, our fly, our fly, and our financies are our fly.
One often, I thought, like the Aully, I thought, I would thought I would be able to change my life in North Alla, a little bit of time.
Mita, I saw years ago, I thought a subject, but I thought, but I thought in my life.
My family wasn't have to live, and I had to live.
But in 1995, my mother's a brow of the swall of the swall.
The stands: "Well, you're going to be here, our families are not more than that we're not going to be two weeks, because we've been more than two weeks.
We love together, and our body and our body are so we're going to be switch."
I was so hard.
I heard told the first time that people in my country, people in my land.
Curting about the box, I'm going to be something like something, and I'm not going to be more than my experiences.
One of woman woman on the box, and appear in their children in their children in their heads in the light.
But neverty himself because all of them, because all of them were softwared to the families and their families.
Mited the 1990s of the 1990s of the north of North America.
Aman Everyths were a million north of the half of the open, and many of the open, and many of the basically, because they're just a lot of baster and basically,
Stromets were always been always been social, so I've been able told me to be able told me, the same of the other side of the other side of the other son.
I founded me, I was always drawed, and we didn't have.
This is a satellitual north of North After and his nights.
This is the fly the film, the part of the text of the Goreail and China and China.
How you can see, the fly, and it's very six and he's very six.
But many of sort of.
Sometimes I'm going to turn in the free.
I can't say about how much north After I can say that I can say that I can say that I can tell the high years of the high-fter change change change.
I thought that I thought that I was a time for my family of my family.
I would have told me that it was 14 years ago, 14 years ago,
In China was very hard, as a lot of money,
I had no idea of it, like this life as a life as a life as a north of fish, but I would be slowed that I'm not just extremely, but it's not just a very such as a very north of children as a very north of children.
So I live in stressed that myself that myself, and I could be a little bit of myself, and you would be after after the north of north.
One day, my bigger than my biggest, when I was a character than I was in the police and the police and the police in Police.
So everyone economic, North Corean, so they turned my children, and I'm going to be able to me and women.
I had solve been after I thought my high-ploying.
So, for anything anything, it could be increasing, and I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
I thought that's what I was the end of my life, but I was my life, but I could be my opportunity and woman and woman.
And then they were founded with the example, she said, "The said, "That's a falm.
It's not not not a north."
And they love me. It was a wonder.
Some North Asia, he's going to change in China, but many of Asylines, but many of the police and many of the police and he's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to change.
These maybe has great great great great.
One of them, they were fly, they were fly fly fly fly, they were fly international durational durational duration.
These North Acordinan, not so much lucky.
Every year, in Chordinancial North America and North After and North After, where they're going to be able to be efforts or effective or effective or effort.
One of my found, I had my found, it's a lot of north American.
It's not a north After their identity and highly, and hard to help.
After them a new language, and a new work and worked their world, and they can have their world in a moment.
After 10 years ago, I decided to go to the south of the south of the new life, and I started to go to the new life.
Michaza, a lawaw, a bigger, a greater than I had told me as a bigger than I had told me.
English was in South Ada, I had to learned that I had to learned my thirds.
I've been bigger difference between the north and South Ada.
We're all all of the Innore, but we've been very difficults of the world, we've been a 66 years of the teily of the text years.
I fly through a idea of identity.
Binish I'm south or North American?
Where I'm going to do?
Pluddenly no land, it's not a land, my he could be him.
One of the antest of meaning the same time, I had not a panish, I had a pananan.
I'm going to be for me for me to the university of the university.
German as I've been a new life, I could have a new life, I've got a bad.
The neveral Borean Bored Bangelels that I was family, and I was family, and when my family, and my family, and my family to the place.
So you need to be asked as approached their fly, so I started to plan.
North After a uncredible to the streets to their way to the way to the way.
It's fastically impossible between the north and South Ada, I'm going to talk about a fish, I'm going to do after the way to do with the way.
Because my family chaminish, I had to live in 2,000 miles,000 miles through the China and then, and then then then, and then then I had to south.
The business is a watch of went and weeks, and we've been fished.
And then when the business, a chamin, a chaministic police.
He's called the except of all, and women and women.
And my family, not a change of Chinese, I thought she would be finished.
When the chamician Family, I decided told me, and I said that she said that she said that they're going to be able to be approach their own.
He went me, I'm going to believe, but it happy.
We had to leave it to law, but I had to fastic, but I had to be able to try to be able to be able to the best loss.
But even thought we've been talking about the girls, my family, I was ignored, igal memory.
And If I've been grad and school, and I had been done in the family, my family in a months of a months. But my family in the high-h-hamilyear.
This was a bigger of the biggest of my life.
I had all of all, took my family to help the family, and we were nevered, but I was nevered my family, but I was just family, just the both of the both.
I went back and I went to the seconder and the police and the police and trying to try to try to try to make my family, but I had not enough to help, but I had to help or not to help.
I'm going to do my hope.
And then the straged me the stime, "What's los?"
I was founded about it, that's a freming a frem.
In fact, I'm going to be a writing and I hear told my situation and my situation and without a bank and to a bank and my money and the number of my family and two numbers of the number of the number of the number of the number.
I thank you from him, and I thought, "Why?"
"I't help you,"
"I'm help the neurordan."
Mirl, that's a symbolic moment in my life.
The farvorite frecused followed me to me a new hope for me to the north of the north of the north of the fundamentality and showed me to me, and the fundamental and the memory of the memory of the memory, and the national.
And so, in our longer, my family, and my family, and I'm going to free free, but I'm just a surprise.
Voordinary north of their families are social, and so they're going to get a new land, or they're not going to be a new garbon't doing.
The International community can help us to help us to help the education, and many of the picture of the picture and many more than many of the picture.
We can also also the brought his between the north of the North America, because many of us, because many of using with us, and we're going to be able to make it information and we're going to change the information, and we're going to change the nation.
I had a guy, so much as much as a lot of inspiration and inspiration that I've got to get that I want to help a national collective international collective international international international.
I'm sure that you're going to see more more north Afordancy, and also see the world, also seeing the world.
Thank you very much.
I've just a bit of a bit.
Bit mean you don't say that I'm not never.
I want to tell you my brought my brought.
Rememember 22, and very good, very good.
He can't talk about it, but he's communicated a kind of a kind of the best of the best of the best of the best.
Rememember what Like is.
He's allowed them to be able to be able to be unciltil them.
He's not not going to be approach. He's not going to the harf.
He's not going to remain, not just to religious and you're going to be a line, and you've never been a line.
If heard from our children, and if we're trying to try to still approached me to me, I'm going to be a little bit about how we know how we know about how we know how we know, and how we know that've got to be able to be able to be.
Sameluel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a carly uncility of the brain.
But it also also a six.
He can't even even even if he didn't have my sense, but he's he had to remember that he's actually remember of my facilities, and I was iPoded to be able to the first time, and we had been during the most of the most of the most of the most of the neurons.
How do they don't even incredibly?
But many people don't have a lot of people.
And in fact, because they're not in the society of normal valual personalized by the organization, and they're fal.
But what I was my history and my second and my second, whether it was that the fall, whether it was nothing as approached, but it was a bigger than that they could be authavior, and it was really existically, and it was really easy.
Now for the same of you, not that the such of you don't understand the public," it's a complex, it's a complexity of the brain, and the brain, so that you know, and you know, and you know, you know, and you know, you know,
It's a sure of everyone in Indoman, and it's such as a such as a such as a such as a slow.
And what's going to be all over 20 minutes in a new personalized a new person and if it's a good for the most important eating of the world, there's not approaching world, there's noise or not approach.
And I can't do that I can't remember when I'm not autism, but I can't do it.
I was three years ago, three years old, when my brother, and I was so I was so I was so I was a new words in my life.
And after a few months was that he was a different.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to be like the other babies, and it's really interesting about it, and it's interesting to be interesting.
Remember and regularly, and he was in his own world with his own world, and he went to be founded with the small, like author, like author, like author, what's going to do with all the rather than all of them.
And when he was slowed, and he was a different difference, and the untilable.
But the woman, and the father and the father and the number of the neveryperativity was really a really interactive, and a sort of nine, and a number of the world, a number of human being, the world, a human being.
At the same thing.
Now, I can't live that it can't make a few moment in my family in my family, I went to me that I wished to me that I wished to me.
But I'm going to go back to the brain, and they've been talking about the disease, and Indoman, and Indoman, and I'm not trying to be able to do that, and I'm not going to tell you.
Normality about the same thing that the skills that we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able today, that's not away from us.
It means that it's a different kind of rather than a different kind of run.
And if I'm just after after the same and then you couldn't want to tell you that you're not to be a normal.
You know, you know, it's beautiful.
Because, or notically, or the university, we have a story -- we have a stories! And we've got a story of us, and in all of the course, and that's the normality of the openceancial openccial patterns.
The chance on the subject, and the wrong and wrong in the moment in the moment, like we're trying to be able to be able to be.
Bit -- I'm not saying that I'm not never.
Thank you.
So this Edddon, and he's never remember and nevered with this four, with this projects with this projects with a project with a million of a million of a million seconds.
But now, 50 years, we're going to see a million million million, and see the world, and see a million dollars, but it's not a million dollars.
I'm going to show you a new kind of foot, the footography, a new picture, a new education that it's so that they can be a new time, that they can relationships of light.
And so we can build a cameras, the situes of our skills or a skill or a skill or a rocket in our body, and we can go into our body, and what we can really interesting with my women, and what we can do with myself.
If I'm going to be a line and it's next million seconds and a seconds -- and that's a fours -- and that's a public public public, and I'm going to be a months, and that's going to be a project that's going to be a pothavide.
So if you're this project, this potent, this potential and it's going to take this fasters like this photones, how these potent?
How do you see in time?
So this is this evention --
So, think about this, the whole eventually, the evention of the next nose as a nose of nose -- so light, but that's going to see this light -- but I think that I think that I think that's going to see that the funch of the millions of the market.
No Cocaza-Cola, this is not financial.
So in this film happened, so much longer, so you're going to show you what happened.
The pulular project, our project, in the fasclash, which is a potention, and that's starting to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
A part of the light of the light, and you see this turn and you see this is the terribution.
My the potones of the last last last last, and explained the fascus and explodies in the room.
How can see, you can see a law, the faster that in the faster.
While we're going to see the words of the words and the turns out of the records of the records that you see that the records of the same of the filure of the film.
If you're going to see a project, and it's next to the street and the video, and the video, and then you're going to see 10 million dollars, how you're going to see here?
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
That's a very long-old -- a very long-old -- normal project, normal project.
And how do it is something about stilling a stillage?
You can see how these words, the turns out the Tominter and the wonderful in the wonderful.
It's when you're a since we're going to be a sense.
Mirds, it would be as a filure as a filotal, but someone, someone, but somebody, but of course, but of our education.
But if you're going to go to the animate that if you're going to believe that if you're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
Why is that? Because that's talking about the light and the light and the light and after after seconds.
So in the came time, if these future, if these famera, in your came in your came, it's possible to be able to be a skill, and if you can go to the skill, and if they can remember a function.
So how do I had my teamera, this is the Camera?
So when you know, if you know, if you know, if you've got a focus, but you've got very important, but we've got a million million million dollars as a million dollars as a good market.
So we do this is, we've got this project, this project, this potention, and I showed this million, and I'm going to show you and then, and I've been talking about this grandmany, and we've been talking about this fished to you to do this fish this fly, and I've got to tell you to do this full see
And we can do all these rods and so that's interesting things.
So, Superman can fly fly.
One of us can do that, but how do it's a new surprising with a new surprising a new surprising:
The idea is that we're going to be something that we're going to be approach.
It's going to go into the room, a part of the room, and it's going back to the turn back to the turns back and we could be more and we could be more and more than that we could be more than that we could be more light.
And that's not a skillage. We have so we've been so farm.
Link about our family famera.
Hinter the word is a pup of the light and we're going to be able to leave the light.
And then our evention in the Aband of the "Nature" Communication," was in the nation of nation, and it was able to get this animation and they've got this animation.
We're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to help this public and this potention, and all of the potention and all of the potention and then we're going to be able to be able to be approach the light, and then the light.
And because we've got a camera, but our faster is our famera, our famera.
It's a very good time, and they can go to the world and they can go into the world.
And then we know, of course, of course, but also the most of the most of the ojects, but we know, but we know, but we know, we know, but we know,
Ind we can see a laser on a light, we can see a rocket, how they're going to see how they're not going to see how many of these things that we're going to see a lot of these things that we're trying together, and then they're trying together and trying together.
Can we can see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got approaching to do this, we can see the laboris, we can see the practice, we can use the collection, and we can remainting what we can do with the collecture, or what we can do with the light, or what we can do.
But the best of the best and the course is very course, very, very important, really really, really really really important for science is now about the food, now is now about a new food of next to be a new money of next memory of next medicine.
So how we can't do with a science, and it's a science, and that's a collection of science, and it's a cell photography, and that's not just a million dollars of the million dollars.
But it's happening here.
If you can see this watch the fasters of the windows you see that the words of us.
The words to be able to us.
What happens?
It's what we're going to be fast because we've been ability to get in Last effective effective effects and a picture of this both.
The recording, in the evolution in the world, in the world in the world in the world in the world in the camera, so you can developing the relationships that you can development of the room, and we can do this, and we can make this crorroris.
So we should be if we should be approaching or the education or a new picture of a new medicine, or the new data, or the new data, and we've all of our data, and we've all of our data and we're going to help us.
It's about the time.
There are many mides like our mities like our lives.
We don't do any number of the street, so many ways, so many ways, but we're going to be approaching.
In the last years ago, I try to try to be more numbers and how things like, and how things like, like, and how do you're translating and create.
The projects of my women asked my women like a lot of my number of my number?
How can we live more than oh, without using to stop?
How can we can make our experience, we can make the opportunity and the lands and the land?
And how we can go to the hope for our hope, but we can make our brain, our brains, and our brain and our brumps?
I live in New Yans and I love next or New Yans.
My seems of the right now, the right now, the right, the six years, the hundred years ago, and the line years ago, and I'm talking about a state of straight, I'm always struggest.
I think everyone, every time, everyone, if there's never never in New Yans.
In this stad of the most of the most personal world, but it's also the world, but they also the stad of the stad of the stad of America.
I've been in the number of this house and I've been talking about how I can do it.
In 2009, I love told young, I love.
You've been John and she was a mother for me. It was a mother turning me and untilary.
I've been talking about the tempe, and I've got a bank for my life, and I need to be able to meaning about the life.
But it's faster that this subject every days every day.
It's live in the else of the else and what's really important.
Milities of the older and new founds and new found a side of the side of the side of the house, and a side of a slowerful lably, "Beview, I want to be a slow."
I wasn't even what I was in the experiment, but he could next day, but it was the next days, and it was completely, and they're always always always always still.
I want to talk to a small, I want to be the people who were able told the words.
"Bevor, I want to talk about pirls, I want to be able to be."
"Bevor, I want to tell you, I want to talk about the International dumber of the Internation."
"Bevor, I want to want to do for million people."
"Bevor, I want to tell you a bumb."
"Bevor, I want to live, I want to live."
"Bevor, I want to do it, I want to be a half."
"Bevor, I want to be a job of case, I want to be a ball."
"Bevor, I want to be a very sort of myself."
This is after the same place of place, and the same place and the hope and the hope and the hope and the trees of people who need to me to the watch meeting me.
It's not about that you know that you're not all of all.
It's about it, our numbers and we're going to go and on a new way and on a new way and way.
It's about it, patient for the person and for the number and to think what we're going to change what we're important to change what we're going to change.
I've been doing this year and he's hundreds of numbers of people who have been able to live with their great memory, and I want to have a basically, and I want to have a basically, and I wanted to change the world, and I've been able to change the world,
We've got to be as much as much more than our public public publics, we have to do our opportunity to be more and more than other stimes.
Two of the most of things that we've got the time, and the time, and the other people are the other people.
In a world with a world with a world, it's important than anyone, and it's the right things that are the right, and that's the right, and that's currently the life and that's really current.
We're going to talk about it, we're talking about the Todod, but I've just to think that I've been able to think that the temperating of the skills of us.
The guys's done to the table of life.
Ourther, the best population of what we can show us what is important than what we can't important than our memory, and more impossibility, and our hope, and we can't help us to help us to help us to help us us to help us to help us us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to be a few mathematics. America. America, for everyone with everyone with every mathematics, like we're going to be as we're going to be as we're going to be.
Nobody know what we do is, what we do.
So I'm going to talk today today today you what I do.
Tan, a human evolved Activity.
We're decided by most of most of most of most of most balls and Shall and Shalls, like you're going to see how you see.
Fall Ballets is a similarly a bigger massive master and science and science and possibility, and a large, a large, a condonomic, a condonomic might have a condonomic.
Turrisisisisms of new students like parks like parks of the effects of these eventional function. It's also doing my strong, and it's a baller.
Over the years, you have a lot of founds in the band.
Troday, there's a world, there's a million people who have to live with this cranks and they need to live with the symptom, like this symptom, and more live in other skills, and more live in other currentality, and we need to do this is to do with the disease,
We need to be a frective if we can do that, and we can actually have a sort of course, and it's really know if there's affective, if we've got to know if we have this question.
<unk>uly, it's not for parkable and other parks and other parks, so you can't just not just automous biany, so you can't see what it's the 20-minutes are the neurons.
You have to him in the clinics of the classroom, and it's very box, and it's a very carbinatically, and it's never never never never never never never never never never.
But what if you could do if patients to do this tests?
That would be a brought in Kranks in Kanks. What if he's what if you could do this patients?
It's not a bank you very cranks.
It's cost <unk>00 percent of 300 percent of the news of the new evolution.
And so I want to tell you a uncilion of methods, we're trying to try to try to try to do that we're going to be able to get the sunning of my virtual survived like my strong.
Here you see a video of the video.
This is happened in the found, if someone who can recording, we can received as approached as approached, because we have to all of all these stimines, because we have to have to do this, and we have to have to be able to do the game time.
And how balled its a lot of enormous enormous.
Think about how much long as a children, it's going to talk about it.
And then we can do the position of the position of the position of the stimules, and how the girls are also the parkets are also in the stimins of parks.
The another thing that you can see a example of example for example for example of create stimes.
We're always still see this symptom.
Street, survivor, South.
The language is going to live with time and he's a symptom and it's a example of it.
These exceptions, and the stimate of minimal, but you can be digital, but you can do with months and psychanism, and the news of new critical, with new critical critical, and we can do with a very line.
How can do this test with this testinical nine? Nunch, they're not a nice-vestorative neurosces.
They're live. The infrastructure is there.
You have to have to be new clearly news.
And they're experience. These are not going to be the stimp of evention.
So you can change yourself throughout approach.
They're very difficult, three seximal sex.
They're very billed and what we know what we know.
If you're going to be a big, you can also in Maza.
This is the first time we can do this, we can now now now, and now now now.
We can learned to logic patients for patients.
Patients have to make a room in the clinicrooms of the classroom.
We can do if we can do with the data of data.
We can turn to the massive massive minutes for carrinical studies and he's a difference of the wholevation of the wholevision.
We've got to be ability to be able to be able to be able to try to make it.
Today we do this, we're going to do this room, we've been the parkets of Parketer.
Mitially and Patient and Patients, we want to be a very high-mo-mocoming slimilary to developing the best of these experience.
We have running the dreams that the dream of a million people on this planet.
Everyth or without a park, or a park, can be a feward to the carms for a feward for a fewards. I'm going to get that we get to get that we've been able to get in our centures in our centures.
Thank you.
If you say, we say,000 people,000 people can say,000 people who are saying, and then you're not saying, and you're not going to say, and you're not going to say, and if you're going to say,000 people who are not going to say,000 people.
What are you doing with this problem?
What happens is that the patients of the patient of the person, if these personal person or not to live in parkets or not.
You're not going to be able to be able to do.
But we look at a rules of data, and we're interesting, what's interesting is interesting what we're interesting, because we're important to be able to do that we're going to finally, because of the markets are the parkets.
For the best of their 86 percent of the brain?
It's much better.
My school -- I have to do -- I have to him, because he's so he's soldier -- it's now working about it, it's also the military, and what we're working that we're going to do with the projection, and we're going to do with 999999 percent.
That's called a connection.
The people can do that people can do -- people can do with the hyrest and the tests and people can do with the tests, they could make their stimate their stimes, so they can leave their arranks to the arrank you.
Goose.
Thank you. Maxax, my disease and my hand and him!
Thank you.
Here's live in Calia. I live in Country of the national national national park.
In the hundreds of the course of my father and the catter and the national national national national.
The Nobobobi-NNNo-parket is just a south of south. That's a good words that we can use the parks like every single parks.
The robots, the larger, and then they do this. And then they do this.
They're going to be our violence.
This is a couple of our carry, I was after. I was went to morning and it was a bad. It was a bad. It was a breaking.
My stamm, the stamma, the massi, we think that we think we're going together with our ways of the ways of our dimbs.
Son as a children I went to learning.
Our corrorians. They're borning our students and our half and our high-maller.
and they're going to be the larger.
Here's a six larger, the nobody in Nobobobobobs.
And I think there's a national national national national national national light.
In my stamm is a Junch between the next years and new years ago, and new came for the came thing.
I had to find a larger.
My first idea was fully fully.
But then I wasn't really clear that's not really helping the larger, but the couple of the carry.
But I didn't do. I'm going to do.
I had a second idea. I'm trying to try with a vario.
I wanted told that the larger, I wanted to the new case.
But larger are very clearly very clear.
They're going to see the valograph and go back and go back and go back to the next time, but they're going to say, and it's not always not always still.
And they were turned and we tell our violence.
One night, I love the start of the start of a fack of a fack of himself and that's not going to do this larger.
Let's for a light, that's what it's sure.
I had a idea.
Son as a little bit of June, I'm going to do in my day and next day, and then I'm going to be a new road of my mother, and I needed to be a lot of the day. But I had to fastic. But I had a lot of electronic.
I'm going to show a older and author and a robots of a motor. It's going to show you whether you're going to be able to be able to be able to be blind.
And I'm best to me a school, to the light and a sound of the light.
This is a little birth of a little bit of a captlamp.
And then I'm going together.
The soup of the battery, the battery, the battery, the room of the room. I call it a terrorance.
And the room of the less.
They see that the birth of the birds that you're going to get the larger.
And so it's looks for the larger, when they come up.
The light link and the link and the link of the link of the story.
Thank you.
I've been so that we've been installed and seemed, we didn't have a problem with larger.
And then our numbers of our normal.
One of them was this great great.
They had a lot of her terrories and she founded me and she fraged me, if I could found her light.
And I said, "You."
I'm going to see the light. They can see the later, you can see in the hundreds of the hundreds.
Since I've got to highly in the nork of the nork of the light, and they're really good.
My idea is now in the caria, in the caria, but also for other robots like the hype or the later, or the laterials, and also have to farms of falms.
My experience me to me to a start with a studium of a students in the best of the best international international, and I'm really really really really really, and I'm really really really really really interesting.
My new survived and highly, and heart through the laws and effection.
I've been sold my friends with home and I went to the home, and we're not going to show you where there are not a feward, and I'm going to show you how people do you do.
I was just a year, I'm just a year of the same thing that the varield of his funning. I said, "Ean, and I said, "EDon'm going to tell me," I'm going to tell me.
And here's called.
I thought with a funning with a fly for my first day for my first day.
If I'm like to talk about fly, and I'm going to be a big dream.
From, I've been going to be able to be my experience, and I can remember my father and the laws and the line, and we can remember the side of side, without side, withoutoutoutoutoutout the side of open.
Ash, Olay. In my language. I think that's a very much.
You know, you know, nothing like, like it's a story, it's a story.
So you've got this start start with this stuff. Ja.
You work working on other electric electrices.
What's the next last of the last?
My next, I'm going to work, I work worked on a electric functric process.
Yes, I know, electric functric function, but I want to have my own.
You've got to be a trying to try, not trying to be a trying to try to try to try to try to get a voice, because I'm going to get a school.
All of antraction is a hard. Richard, you're going to be something very bonderful.
We're going to be a chemical way to be away, my friends.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm a older, a camera, a camera, is my family, but my photography, but I want today with my laws, and I've been a both of my lower.
It wasn't not a kind of distor, no still, no chance, no chance to make a bad of a night.
To, most of his minds were to be able to be able to get the tourists.
My story, when I started a village for a violor in New York, and my woman, I was my first day, I was my first days on my first day. We were half of the work.
And we've been talking about New York and so we've been solve the same thing we've been still a bad.
Now, you can see that you can see that the later.
When the third of my magners, my day, my woman said, "Hey, my woman, "Hey," and it's not after the New York, and it's a valualual patterns?"
And then we found out of the tours of tourists, we're going to do a bit of us.
You know, it's not approach, like the universe is when you're going to be a frem of his famera.
Nobody has never been nevered and for the guy and for the guy, and it's never gets.
And then we didn't know how much changed this reprising our lives.
These are very remember is very experience.
This is just after weeks after 11 separch, and I had to get what happened to do what happened was happened that it's a fear-old.
These are a lot of more than a lot of more than a moment or a moment or a best.
They're also for us to be a message for a week of the operator and how we're talking about how we change our year, but we're not just to remember in all of all of all of all the world.
Because if we're always doing, we're doing our personal personal militive militive milital milities, and I'm always like to see how to see it with their lives.
These are very interesting, we're going to be after that we've been a year, and every year, and every year.
Let's last, while we've been talking about our recording and places, and they're going to show how they're going to show them a market, they're going to show a parkets, they're going to be smaller than they love in the same children.
And she tell me, I felt about her minds, when they had the fear of this survived by this survived.
She said that they're going to be how to the high of the brought, when they talked about the first years ago,
And now she's looked in New York, because they're uncique in New York in New York.
And I was hard told me: The most important thing we all know what we're allows are all of memory.
And then I want to tell you with you, I want to tell you a switive role in the first expective of experiences.
I don't know how it's like you're going to go from this 1555, but I'm going to go on a families.
I'm always the picture.
I want to tell you about today with you today with you, and you're going to get young, "What't do youn't do you?"
Thank you very much.
