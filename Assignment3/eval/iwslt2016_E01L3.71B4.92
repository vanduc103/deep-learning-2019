When I was 11 years ago, I was a mence of the celling of the celler.
My father, his body, his little bit, the road, the roads of the name.
He was very much of what happy to be very such as a very unlimilarly, because it was in the number of them.
He's the TED, "The's no no!
I don't know what I didn't know what it was really doing my visualualy, very importantly.
Now, "You can see a bring to the same thing," he said, "You know.
The morning I'm going to be able to be able to be.
And one of the same.
The Talanced to the might be in Aghanistanist, I was six, and I was to go to the middle, and I went to go back to the same.
And so I five years ago, I five years ago, and I started to start and myself, and my such more than anything, but not just surface, you're going to go to a simply.
And so we could do we could go back to the school.
Every day, we've got a way, we could never been never been a nobody could be able to do.
We've been able to the books in Earth, so we would like it would be a bit more than we would just like a little bit.
Ourrounded in a house, we were 100 minutely in a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
I was a winter, it was in the same thing, but it was unfortunately,
We all know that we all the most likely, we all the large, and our countries.
And in the first time, the universe of the universe for a waller to the words because the terrible to the test.
We were never used how much more than they were talking about us.
Let's what they do?
When they're going to do where we do?
We had been to do, but we wanted to go back to the school.
I had great greated in a bighly in a family, in the bigger than the test and bigger than turned out.
My greatest, his time was a time.
At a bighly from a provinces of After Afteranistan, and it's a day, my mother -- my mother, and my guys -- and I was to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a variote.
My filmed militter, but it was a later.
It's them.
A two years ago, they were just in the room, just to our house of our house and women and women and women.
And my father -- I was seeing the first time in his family, the family, a sline.
Forn was him, it was a children, his children would be a children, but also would be able to be a terrible to be the terrible.
He was a lot of a lot of larger than a risk, his children, not to be hard to be a little kids.
I know that I know that I know that I was in the tal years ago, you know, and so I was social life, and the possible of the positive, and the positive,
I went today, I had told me. But then, "Thather, I'd hear told me.
Do Gove can be a destrows. You can be in the couple of the house.
But one thing is a smaller: It's always what we're going to believe in ourselves, and we're going to do with our numbers, we're going to do that we're going to do.
So -- I want to still you to still?"
I'm 22 years ago.
I'm in a landward to the year, and the year, the century.
When asked 66 percent of my older, I have age of myself asked a seconder than my family, and when my family, but I don't have to be a women, I'm not a women.
And I'm going today, I'm going today, I've been strident.
When I was after I was back to myself, my greatest, the greatest of the family, because it was because it was because it was a taking, because it was to being a taking the first time.
He's not just just with my high school, but I'm also the women, I was also the first question, and I'm not the women, and I'm going to focular.
My family family.
I have great trees, but my friends, but my bigger.
And so I'm a global bothter for 1010s, 1010s, for a camp of women.
And so I've got to talk about SOLASA, and the first thing, and maybe a might be a might be in a might, in a country, in a land, in the land, and it's always always stillill still still stillillill book.
It's a bighbody to see how the sline of my bigh school with my bigger with the bigger.
And to see how to see their own and they're going to see how to do my parents, and my parents, and I'm going to be able to changes.
So how I don't really be really really really believe, and I can't really show you can't showed my father is my father.
Approach a months were home and he was the TEDS. South AOLAS.
When he was to home, and he was a telephon and telephone, and it would be a street, he was to be a taking it would be try to be trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to be.
And then he said, "The said, "The, if you want to do you to do, I don't want to tell my terrorists, I don't have to be able to be able to be able to the old."
What is the Aghanistanist, I've got something like something that I've been able to be able to the highter, and the history is the high-fters, and the valualualual, and it's also the bix.
It's not to believe our mother mother pollective in our role.
These are they're going to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of possible for a lot of their drawing in a drawards of the distrible to the same of the universe of the university.
Oural turned out of the terrible to hundreds of the money -- it was a little bit.
Today every day in After Afteranistanistan million million million million million million.
After the first existanists, America, like this.
The American, like, how we're like using us.
I'm not that the changes of the distrible and the US.S.S.
But when I'm in Aghanistanist, when I'm going to start in my slight, and I'm going to look at the parents, and then they're going to be a lot of a lot of a lot of longer and then I'm going to leaders and we've been a long.
After, for me, for me, for me, and the hope and the hope and university and own magness, and every days, and every days,
And I've got to have a big big bigh.
Thank you.
All what I'm going to do, I was really board -- I was founded by the working of the work.
And in 19717, I've been such a board -- but I've been in Sambia, I've been in the 7, and the 7, and the next year, and the countries of the country of the countries.
I have a nonthical network and everybody and every project, and we're going to be the box, we're going to being.
I was founded.
I thought, I thought we've been doing people are people in Africa and work in Africa.
And we're takes we're all the first thing we're all.
Our first project project, what I'm going to show my bix, "Rian," in the camii," in a camer, we want to show you how we want to show you to show you like the name.
We came with the same satically satells in South Adambia, in this taking in the same thing to the same thing, and we're going to be a bixically, and we're going to believe the terric.
And of course, the answer is not authter, but we don't know what we're not going to work for them, and we're also doing.
We were instruct that it was social landing in a country, nothing.
But to figure out to free, they didn't just like, "Go, we're just like, we're just here.
"Gave means to read the side of people whole people to the side of the same."
Of course, all of all of all the Africa.
We had been practice, we were terromes, they were soldier, so they were so big big big big big bigger.
We couldn't believe and saying, "Shambook, "Shand, like Landand, like Life."
When the tomates and the terms, and about 200,000 nights about 200, and the family and all the family.
We said, "Oh," "Oh," the God," the namp.
And they said, "You's not the land, we've no land."
"Why don't know what you didn't know?"
I thought, we were just like this, but I were solighly in Africa, but I'm going to do what I'm going to do what I doing the founds, what I did didn't doing the name thing I was going to doing.
We're five the nest of number of number.
They should be the univers -- you should see the universe, we don't see the African, we've got to be able to be able to see.
They should be the Badadad," from Dotebo, Moya, it's a longer, and we're symaller.
This was 2009009009009.
We have been changed the African African centures, 150 years ago, in the last 50 years ago.
I don't want to tell you what I'm not what it has been story.
Let's just simple.
Let's a African African, what we've got to story.
We're important idea of the idea, colonial, and there are just two months, and we're just like to do with people. We're going to do with patically, we're going to patically.
And the water of the later of the watchiece of the word "Thather"
But they have two boxes.
Patchian: I'm going to be a different culture, everyone, asked my children.
Patronisis: I think, I'm going to be a other culture, asked my distries.
And so that's going to be able to be in Africa," Cana,"
I was went told me, I was like the Ball, "Shalle," and I said, "Shator," in all the century, and we want to be able to be able to learning in the room.
This is the first popular population.
The first population is the high-pep.
Today, the morning of the high, the carrones, and he was a stability, "What, "Cococading, you don't know, you don't know?
When I was 27 years ago, I was just founded me to be a few people, and I've got a system, and I'm going to be a name time in the personalmotion of the motives, you're going to believe the doney.
What you're going to be hundred.
You're not never called a great idea with idea, you're going together with the same.
We don't work from Bros from Bros.
We're going to turn in Chris. We're going to us.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to be found and we want to find what you want to do what you want to do.
The first thing is the most important.
You can have a small idea of idea.
If you don't do that?
The person for the person forest of the water is important.
The posion for the water is important is important.
We're going to help them to make it to be able to be allow.
The person is the idea of the idea is not knowledge, it's not approach.
A lot of years ago, I had a lot of watch, we should be in a guy, and what they're going to do what they're not going to do it? But we don't know what we't doing.
Let me show you a guys.
There's a problem with the problems.
And internet have never been remember and they're going to say, "pever, what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they want to see what they're seeing.
Plany has been starting this found.
The first people who are not the most people who don't know because you don't know because they don't know, because they're not just to do.
We're working to do a bring to do this is to do this infrastructure, but it's not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
One of the bigger.
This is the house of the universe of the university of the borth, the break of you, your house, your centratically, and the central, you know, you know, yourself to be a lot of life.
I have this in the west, we've trying to trying to trying to trying to try.
If I thinking to try to try to try to do the time, and we should do what we should do what we should do what we should do.
And so I love in the first year, and the first year, and the first time, and he was three days, I three day. I was him to him to himself in a marian, I was a morning. I was a guy.
I half you know, 50, and I'm working and this is not a funchielder, and I don't know in Alth American, "Cancocious, Indian," for 150s.
In a year, I had 27 percent of the project. The regraming to me to me to do me, "What?
How do you do. I said, "I'm very much.
I half the mundred and him to him."
So -- -- I say, "Mo, "Mever, you're going to still."
We've been a 300 memory in 300 memory.
We have 40,000,000 basically,000 people.
There's a new brains of the universe of the universe.
Peterms, the best of the universe of the universe of the story, 666 years ago.
Peterms was a posophilosophophor, he was borning with parents with Parluters. We said, "I's a parents invention of a parents in a parents and unciety of the society."
Plancation is the test of the universe of the universe.
So you're going to know, to know what you know what the most carry, what the most human being carmers and their brains and their own possible.
You have to learn how to do this, you have to get a bring to get a bring.
You have to him to himate the posphics and you have to be a bigger. You have to be him to be him to be him to be himself.
In a guy of 10,000 people have been 200,000 course.
Can you can imagine a guy of 400,000 people who are the Internet, and the person?
For the practice practice, you've been able today?
<unk>ual economically, people have to believe.
I want to say that I want to say that the universe is the way.
We're the end of the first time, we're called the richervorite -- and fully, and it's not system -- and it's not systems not systems are not to believe.
The practication is nothing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
The Fronombrony is nothing instruction is not.
We need to tell us how we need to do them to be able to be able to be able to be able today, and we can strong with them, and we can strories.
The technologies are not existing.
Who is the technology for the biggery?
The government?
It's going to be able to do it. And now.
I'm long a story in autistory of a magine years ago.
It was a graw of the basically, the effects were able to the city of New York Tw York, 180s.
In 180, they were came together and they were in 100 years ago, in New York, the New York, the New York, the next stories, the next year,000 years ago.
Why? You see? As you can see the curve and when the carved, when they need to be able to be able to be able to do it, they need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Because they went to the month.
180, they see the carms of the technology, the nevery of New York.
What happens? 40 years ago, in 1900, in 19008001001001001001001001001001.
The other idea, a technology to find a technology, the robots. It was a little bably, and it's a little babland.
And then, Mich, Michicho. Howry.
There's a brain, to work within with the universe.
When he had to him to himate them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
One of them, and they don't want to tell you.
As next to them to him to him to himselves, and we've been such a service.
Then you have to him today the words of the universe.
Frony little bigger to be the bigger, all of the large of the large things that are three things like to be able to be able to be able to be the production of his fosphere.
Rata?
We've never have a personal person, we've got to producation, and we can use it to be able to create the brain.
So what's not just a little.
These person was called the personal.
We have founded the free and we have 100, and we've been able to the world -- the world -- Carngest, the couple of the new couds, the news, the news, the news,
There's just a satch, all the world, all the world, the world's just a world, just a couple of the world: a person.
Now, we're living 16-th-ththththththers, and we started to the university and we started to the first time, and the first time, and the first parents of the countries of the first time. The first posphere.
Nobody's "2," and 32 month.
He wasn't know than he was.
Nobody's a biggest free. No. No.
So we can do a great idea, you can have a smaller, the smaller, and you have a little bit of Crina, and you've been taking your basically, and you're going to do that you're going to doing this.
What you can do it?
Okay, you can do it?
"Oh, I can't know that I can't say that you can't do you know that you want to do you?"
We're going to be able to be able to do.
We've got three of free of the future, the universe of the universe of them, and we can help them to help them to help the minds and we've got to help the Internet, and the Internet of the Internet.
Thank you.
I five years ago, I have to be able to be age, where it's age of the words.
The patternsity is a bigger -- I'm a data for me -- for a cover -- instration -- instration in the universe.
I had been approach --
It's a number of these students.
But as the fact, the same thing, like me, it's like told me asked me, and they're going to be a new world, and weeks, and weeks.
And I founded me, I was five asked me with the students, I was five students, I was going to talk about the brain, and they want to be a different different words, and well.
I think that's what we think about this taking to do it.
We need to do incredible creative creative us to us us to change our world and instructure and to change the world.
Because our science and instants are the Injective, our problems, and our problems like the problems like the energy, and we don't know about it, and then we don't know about it. I think it't know it. I think it't believe it.
But these bigger creative country, if we don't know our scientists and our instants, and we don't know how we don't have a wonderful.
So science and scientists, and we're going to be us to us.
I want to show you a few of a few of how we could see it might be able to see that we can see that we can see the technology, and the technology, and you can see it.
The first question, you've got to be able to be able to do it?
Sagine, why was a science, society is society for us.
Sagine us not just that you can't just taking us, but also saying us to us that you're also the treatests, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And when you're going to do what you do you do, then you're going to be able to be.
And so we're a hard to changes for the brain.
Some of their older, you couldn't really crimate, but it was not just like, but they're not just like to changing, and what's going to changes us?
Ourther, the brain is not to do it's not just like the same thing like the same thing.
How do you're going told me: "Meah, but it's not just like -- but not just like.
You can do something that's a little bit about something that's a science, and it's own cariously, to be able to do.
A few things are things to be able to be able to be able to the stories, and these stories, and they could be in the ways of us to us in the board.
And when you work working on the work, then you're longer, then the stress.
Hably you have to tell you, "Shump," it was "So"
What's a nobody, if you're going to be a different?
And so it's not just like this is not just like this, but also, so we're very language to work with our brain, and we're going to be able to be able to be able to talk about our brain.
These example of the brain of Golved by the broved, we're going to show you that you can see that the structure of the structure of the treatment is that they're solarly the Internation.
The Trick is a taken a longer, simple simple simple simple, and it's audience, if it can be a patients, and it can be able to the other same and our opense of our opence and our opense.
These are just a few of a few of us to help us to help us to see the wonder and the science and the science and technology and technology.
And the Instant, I've been story, I've been drawing with me, "No," in the cells," I want together with a same thing I want together with a same together with a same.
So the collecture of science, and science and economy, and the filure, and that's the rivers, social, social, and what's important to be able to be able to the brains to be able to work with their own.
So science and instructure, when you know, if you're going to be able to me to me to me.
Thank you.
Hio. That's my hand.
Abandy can changed a personal life and a few years ago.
My Handybandy can be a humanity of humanity in Syries.
My Handybandy can be a network and a progest programs in the program.
And with a hyband, you can take a land, and it's high-Cludy and books.
All the hymbandy.
I'm a year, and I've been in Blin.
And we go back back to the time in the time.
And then you can see how to see how people can see people who are the people who are the streets of the streets and the stress.
We are in 19888, and we're going to be all these people who are all the country and the country, and we've been in the hype.
Who, Sala has a hymbi?
Hal you hard.
Hald you high-dddle, they half.
Hal you hard.
These are many fast, everyone has authy.
But I want today, and I want today, and I want to changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about it.
This is 350.
Roha.
And why are these information?
Because in 2006006.
These are riversity is called Rightsia, the rather.
These are riversity, everyone is that every particular technology in everybody in the Internet, everything in the Internet, in the camera, a bring of business.
Who you know? When? Where? Where's a bad?
Whoically, a small?
And if you're a country, where you're going to be.
All these information for the information for months of two months of years ago, or two years ago, your teachers or your interesting.
And I'm going to be able to people who have to do and we want to do, "That's not want to do."
They said, we wanted to do these are nothing.
We want to wanted to be in the situation in the time, and we want to be able to be able to telephants and all of all these information, all of using using to us to do.
It was apples, Journalists, Palister, "That's not want to say, "That's not want to do."
And here can see how you can see how people can see people who are the streets of stress, "Frates, "Frates."
And you say, you might be able to be a strashavior.
The studize the brain was the brain in the oceptize.
And I wondered me, if I think it's really working.
Can you really really all the information?
Every media, I'm going to be my hy?
So I found my telephone, I found the drawing telephics, the technology, the technology, and I was founded information, and I was founded them, and I was farmed me to me to me to me.
And I went to found them and they founded them and they didn't get a name thing. North.
But then I said, I want told me, because I want to be my life is because it's what it's process.
So I'm going to tell me, a greater, because they want to have a bit of information, because I want to have to do this information.
But the distress of telephom, we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
Ambody embrically to a same with a same.
I'm going to tell the antuge where they allowed me told me.
Because in the century, the basically basically, the emotion of the evention.
So I'm going to hard this board to be a carm.
And on the CD: I was this:
350.
And then I said, and I said, and I said, it's a good thing.
But then I went to after, I'm going to my life.
These are six months of my life.
So I was a little bitch of what I want to do what I should do?
Because you see what I'm going to be able to do what I'm going to do what I'm going to do.
But then I said, I want told me to do with this information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show you what I want to show what's what's bring.
So let me time with a mine and Opa and I've been here.
This is a visualisualization of my life.
You can relocord and you can go back and you can go back to the coculate and you can go back.
You can do anybody can do, I can do it.
And you can see how I can see how I can see the fank you to the curround out of the cries, and I'm going to do something like a lot of years.
All that's like this information.
It's a little bit of another.
But it's not just to me.
It's about us.
And then it's just so I women, and I women and I women and I women and we're going to be a few marning.
And then I'm going to tell me a few fundred and they're going to a bring.
And If you have a way you to do you and you've got to do this, and we've been dometics.
But you can see how people can see how people can communicate to be a time, they can see a time they're going to go to the bring.
It can see all.
You can see the centralentural figure, about about about about the crupture of the brain.
If you can see this information has to see what you can see what you can see what you do.
If you can see this information has to recognition, you can do.
This is a brought for the Life and the China and Iran.
This is the perfecture of the answer, like a society, because you can't know, because you can't know, because you can't be a bad of allows, you want to be able to be able to do this information.
And these information for the months of months, 666 months, in 26 years ago.
How I said, I said, we said, we're all the streets in the streets in 1988898989898, in 1988898.
And the stress of the stress, who's going to be the drawing, and when the stress, and if you're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
The faller the baller might belief maybe not might be hours.
And also don't know the fall of the faller.
Because we're stating Agent and so many of information, and so many of how much to do it, and they can't want to talk about how to us.
They want to be the middle to our life, and they want to be able to be able to learning.
But the same thing and a life and a life life life, and you're not a time.
But you have today for the same thing for the same thing.
They have to have to do every day.
So if you go to say, you say, you say, you're going to tell you that the wonderms of the year, and it's not a year.
If you go to say, you say, you're just saying, because you just because it's just because the same thing, because the matters of information, and they're not to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, they've been talking about the information.
So, in the future, every time, every time you have to tell your hands, you're going to tell you that you're going to believe the situal time in the time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central Cental Calth.
This is South Central: Caluitio, carrates, brest, best,
So the struggest, so we're going to talk about the namp, and the came thing to the countries, and it's something like to be a little bit of the same thing in the same thing in the city of the city of the strong.
This is South Los.
Lirlo, bocks, surpresenturants, best,
So how many of 25 million American American, I've been in the couth of the carral Los. It's the central and the dreames of the distressive.
The combody is that the drawing more than people are more than the distressive than the distressive.
People in South Central Loscal Loscial crate.
The founds of my farm in my four. It's four memory.
I couldn't doing with it.
And I wondered me like, like you wouldn't even if you don't have to be hundreds, if you've got to see the matter, if you see the news of the new experience, the news of the best of your best of your best.
I'm going to believe that role to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
I'm symallymbrories like this stories like.
And I'm going to start that's got to be able to be.
I know that the problem is that the problem is the problem.
It's the problem and it's the large.
Aregest, I had no line line, I had no line-MMMMy, to get a carmed to get a patterns, nothing in the patterns.
So I'm a few years ago, I'm going told my house.
It's a standard, we're called Parket.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing that it's the stad.
But you have to please it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because I want to do it, and I want to half."
And I'm going to be in the standard.
So I know, and I'm my grewing, the Let. Let's found, and we're founded myself, and it's a patterns and itself, solve the program.
We are a kind of positive-pected together, and all of all of all of all of all of all the structure, and it's free, and we're going to do it, and we do allows.
And the Garm is a little bit.
But then you're going to be a nobody.
The stady to me to me to me to me to me to me to me a practically, and I said that I said that I had told me to a best positive.
And I thought, "Kombon?
And so we're going to believe in the number of number of nobody, you're going to be a land?
And I thought, "Cool."
Because this might be able to go.
The LA. The Times. When we were sense. Sope, and we're going to talk about a story and strates with a money and a money of the first time, and you were a political strong.
We hard told the hard.
My strates, so it said, and soldldld, and they're going to do it, and we're doing.
So why didn't do it?
LA.
They're best 622 books.
These are 20 cral Parket.
It's the figure, to 75 million dollars of the million dollars.
Why didn't want to be the teach?
And then the an effective predicture,000,000 such a 10,000 same sour.
Mary bigger boards in a drawing of the drawing and you're going to the old Warth.
It's myself, I'm going to believe that they should believe it to believe them.
Syear-ludyear-ludy is how to be able to be dradge.
So I've got a small surprisisesent in Centalth Calth.
I went told me. I've got my such a small.
And I'm going to be part of these technology to be the rest of the other people who was to believe in other people, and I found myself.
She's what I'm a carn.
Godies is my graphy. I'm prazy.
Google to a graphi-pe-land-land-land-land-land, I think I'm person and I'm going to beautiful park.
I'm going to tell the brain, like a college, and the population and the population, and my both of these stope.
They're going to talk about what you can see what you can see all the land, if you can use it.
You can't be able to do how we can't be a slumbon, and they can be able to be able to be.
So what happen?
I've got told my Garman, like a centrument for the Internation and the variously, and I was a voice.
And the brains of the science, you have together together the country.
We are the box.
They would be able to children, like this children.
Goday is the most important, and the first time and the first thing, you can do the best of the best of the state.
All the bigger than you know.
I'm going to tell me, when this mother, and they were hard to the day, and it was 100, and I was 100, and I was in my Garm, and I'd been family, and I'll bad.
I'm going to be such a bad, because I said, because I said, "What, I said, "What't do you don't do that.
The Gargest is not a basically, the street."
I've got to tell me, when I've been tell me, and I've got to me, and I've got to do that people who were just to doing me, "Finather you're not just give you're not going to believe you."
And I said, "Weah, I don't know what I don't know what they don't know what they're not what they're not just.
And then it's what it's the strag.
It's the idea.
I want to take it to take it, but I want to get them to be able to be fundred to be fundament."
At one of other time I was a gary in this older, in this carry in the Low.
These are the type, the takes of the later,
It was cool and they were remember their stories, how they had to be able to be able to their mother and their mother mother, and they've been able to see it was like to see it, and it's just just like to see it.
Greenasically, so it's like 20 months.
To us to our Ugraphics, and so we're doing and more and more and more and allows.
If you have children, it's children.
If they takes, they're data.
But if they don't get to be able to get it when they don't getting how they don't know how it's not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
I'm sure young people who want to work, but they want to be in this disting -- I'm going to look at the children, and they're going to go to the person, and they're going to go to the brain.
And that's a surprising as a memory, where we can do these children, and we can use their brain to be able to be after life.
And if we do that?
We could take the next next to the next Carnon Carvorning.
But if we're going together the experience, we don't know, we're not going to do.
So this is my parents. That's what I want to do.
I want to be a whole to be a bocket of parents where people can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a box.
I want to take the sline and they're going to take them in Canawail.
So, you don't know me.
I don't know about the most carlos, the most carry is nothing.
The combody is that it's not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
I'm talking about people who working to work and working and children and the streets and they high, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to believe it, and if you're going to believe it.
So what I want to do this is to do this is to do this.
I want to tell you all the rigological recognize, German,
We need to have to remarkable to relations.
If you don't have no brain is not a brain.
Gangerms, you're going to be a slow?
And long the waiteraures.
If you want to do with me to me to me, if you don't want to do you to do it in the streets and a meter and you want to do with a metressage, where you want to do.
If you want to do you to get yourself, you want to be my guy, I'm going to do with myself.
Frank you.
Thank you.
As my large later, in the later, in the oxxxxynglish is "noxy"
Because it's so much.
And "nost" is a biterally," "You knowledge,"
Once in 198.
I don't have a simple of what's nothing.
I'm going to do with the write.
But it's very important to be very important to the politics, and they're going to know that they're trying to know that they could have to know.
A717, for example, for example, the longer, the parents, not the time, not just the time, the watch of the data.
And that's the next time to the mutes of a moment with the mountain, with the namerved Cambrary, the cambrary,
They were him in the terron, and the later, but it was a month, but it was a month, but it was a month, and he was so much more and so much more universe, so much more condon.
And just a few years ago, we're just found the first night for the first thing for the same thing like "arkets" like Brary.
Brater, the bocketics for the water forest.
But the stimate. It's not going back to a piece of the practice.
But in the corruption, like Politics and politics, I want to tell you to take the U.S.S.S.
You see the question of women like, how you should believe that's the stress,
You don't know it.
How do you call the an an empected in a nation?
And then, I was in the cronger, incredibly.
And there's all the way to all of allows to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
I mean, I wanted to him to himate them, and what other things, and other people, and other people who are others, and other people who are others, and the other people who are the free of the value of the states of the stata.
Not a bigger.
A lot of people want to beautiful car.
They thought that's what you're going to be.
They were not monthsistically, they want to beautiful for a personal time.
It's hard to work.
But everybody was uncredibly, because these data because these three weeks, because these weeks.
I have the test of a sator of a sator, the same thing: "I'm nothing.
The reason for the basically and the long, and the longer was the representation was the same thing.
The represential, nothing wanted to do that what you want to do it.
Can you neverness and it's not a bigger than its own next to be able to be able to be able to be.
They wanted to him to the most most of the most most most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of them.
This was Tituitially, "Prident.
Prident. They have today. They don't have experience. But he was based. But it's a good valualual valuitation.
So what's like a synit of Jury.
He didn't have more than the basically, "An't have to the "Ape."
You're going to be a polential smallermaller and smaller and regulation, but it was really uncluding, but it was really universe.
And so that's live been satching it.
They said, "Thas is not longer, you can't be himate.
This is to be the course of As, and the countries and changes and wrong.
When it's going to take a little bit of a little bit of types like a little bit of the visualiata?"
And also to 3 30s, three data, the satell.
Now, we don't want to believe that you want to believe the terrident, but they want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the political militive and the militive militive metications.
You can do you can interesting things.
He's -- and I've been founded -- I don't know, I don't know if I can't know if you can't have to be a patternet.
Backacka, Obrates, Obrida, the Twita, just just the takes.
For seconder, you can see that if you can say that if you say that it's something that's not just a 22 years ago, you know, you know, you're going to be a 22 years.
Third, and that's really important is important, the most important thing is that the terrident of the video of the video of America," or not more than the carrates?
This is something more than 5000 nulearge than 5000 marters, and we do to do the biggest and the world has been following and the world, and the world's the world.
And so we've been story, and we have been story.
And so that's the end of the end of the end.
They have a slabilities.
And the other same thing of the same thing that was approach of the same thing -- it was so it was so it.
But you know how many national patterns?
174.
Because they all know how to do it, like the countries,000 cars,000 large,000 large.
So the end of the end of the sates and the rather than the rather because it's nobody because if you're going to be a pagine, you're going to be a patterns of the video.
And that's important to do what you can do with the right, and I can do with me.
Politics to try to try to try to try to relations and the rality and the riversity of the next time, but the researchers, but more than the words of the research.
Thank you.
So I came in a later, I'm in a family famp, to the city of the draward, in 1990s, in 1990s, Justrills, Justrilla.
I'm going to see my country Calonstants, a parents, a parents and a country and a country and a room, and I couldn't see the rivers of the river.
This was the first time I was that I was in Aghanistanist.
And I was longer, I was bigger with the biggest, all the new psychologists and the popular, and I'm going to believe the same symaller.
But the bography is the same thing.
And so I'm going to take here, I've been working, Shana, South America, from God, and a great carthers, and a politics and a politics, the last year, and the last year, and the last year.
So there's a lot of Aghanistan, and you might believe that you could do not personally, but I couldn't want to do something to do that I want to do the personality and the personality and the news of the world and electority and the world.
I want to tell you a draward, a drawards -- the distribute, the distrata, like the city of the biologists and biologists and biologists and religiously, and it's political corning.
And what's what can do the dadiad of the drawing, as the parents, and the parent, and we do without a wonderful, I'm going to do with the same thing.
And we try to try to use these camps to use these mariossible to be able to be able to be able to the national.
I want to tell the corruption in Aghanistan, and I'm going to go with a projection of the projection of the polics, and you're going to follower and a cells of the stranger.
I want to me to look like the corning in the carianistanistanists of my monthmonically, "Thead.
The crows and the carm and the collection, the new camp, and a new strange, and a new struggle, and you can just a new memory, you can just a new political smaller and itself, and I can have a box.
And I would see a bix, like a simple of carrabories from the cellize of the cellire of 18998989898 percent of the world, and that the world's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the rather.
But for all these things can be in the opportunity, they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
But I didn't have to believe because I have to be the same thing.
This is my last. Why is your last?
Thank you.
Hio. No. Name Camonon, and I've been working a money than I work.
Some years ago, 10 years ago.
I have the both, I've been in the room in the roombots, I'm not going to believe that I don't know that I don't know.
And I've been stilled something like to do something like to do something.
This is the first time that the first time that you can see the TED TED.
Fall, a few women were really brocked asked asked me, I don't need to say, I don't know that I't want to say.
I also also also think that I'm going to believe that I'm very creative, I can see what I can do about 10 10, you can think about 10,
And then we don't have any chance.
These are very important, very important, it's good, I don't want to be able to be able to be.
The first thing is the first part of the part of my popular popularly about my cope, and then you're going to do you.
In organization.
Why I've got this?
It was a person.
Now, it was not hope, like this picture like this.
One is a maybe, but it's a message.
I've got your memory of your memory in the seconds of the seconds.
And I was in this biggery, I had a number of fundament.
I felt like, very unfortunately, and I said, I said, I said, I said, and I went to my hands in my hands, and I found this type.
And it's going to be able to funch or the brought I'm two days, I'm just two working for the works of our own possibility to our own, and we've been able to our lives -- and it's own lives -- and it's own lives.
Forld me today for me today for me today.
And I'm going to be a book, because I'm a modod.
I'm going to be a book, because I know, because I know, because I'm a woman, and I'm going to take a brought that we're going to be a money.
I'm going to talk about the questions that people who are always stilling to me.
The first question is, "What's going to be a math.
I'm always say, "Oh, but I was nothing, but I don't know.
The basically, like a mathember of maybe, a later, and it's a later and a later, and maybe you might be able to be a best.
Now, in the last year, we've been personalthy, we've been not just asked, and it's not just a criminatically, we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be bigger than well, and it's last year.
This is a created for me. And it's a box, and it's a number of me.
I know there are people in the Publum, the public, and I think about this possible. And maybe a maybe, "Ho," "Ho," "Hio, Jo.
And I'm going to comments I'm going to be a science.
But I've got to you to tell you that in 200700, in 2007, in the dractor, the name of the country, and everything, everything, and everything, and that's not just a book, and it was just a book, or a process.
The next question, the question, I'm going to believe me, "Kod, I'm going to believe?"
And I'm not after, I don't know, "I don't know, I don't know."
But the seconds, I'm going to be smaller, "What is really want to be a little bit?
Because what?
You can see Prident, the U.SAS. He's going to be the next organization or a network, or a network, what's going to be able to the first thing."
If you're going to say, "No, "No, "No, I want to say, "Whel, I want to be a money."
Because I don't have no possible for the Cances, the Cancinan American organized or the value of the cognition of the next minutes or the next memory.
To you say that you're going to be a money, so you want to say that you would say that you want to say that you want to be a line.
You can't be able to fantastically, and it's not a carm.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I want to tell you know, the scientists, as we can do it, it can now now now now.
If you're going to be a cograph, and then you're just like a cities, and then you're going to say, "Con's like, "Co," and then we're going to take the collective, and then you're going to beautiful, and then the work.
It's what they're like this.
Hopeful than the message of the middle.
That was ... I don't know what happened.
If you can see the same and you can have a parents and a few years ago, you can't know, you can't say that you can't say that you want to say that you want to be in the U.S.S.
The next question, the question is going to be, "What's all the fossible?"
And yes, so, all of the fosmotion is just a little bitch of the smaller.
This is all the first foot, I was the first time, and I was also the first time, and I was a biologist, I had a biologist. I had nothing to my pio.
I know that, I know, now, I'm going to be a person, but I was a money.
So I just just just a few months of my months, with my German.
This is what I'm going to the same thing.
My friends, I had to start me.
This is a posychy, I'm a pary, a few sypox.
I'm a found the fall-ball-Mampa and famina.
And I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these bocks are not me.
It's cructed and it's cruructed by a producation of the profess of the course of Moyno, and the cography, and you can't taking the struction of the number of the non-producation.
Okay, askay, asking people say, "K, "Kekay, you're going to do?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-bococlating, I can never believe that I can't believe things that I can't believe in the bombs, and I don't know about the life, and I don't know about life.
I'm in Cambridge in a craw and a day, I had a labor, and I had a guy, and you've got to me to me.
When I wonder, I wondered my friends, and I fundamer, and they were a fully, and we were a course, we've got a course, we needed to be a course, "I're going to be a wonderful," and we could have a wonderful.
I've got these things like this things that I've been able to get my personality and I don't know, and there are people who are not personality, and they don't know a personality.
I've been in New York and 140,000 teachers,000 last year,000 years ago, and I were filmed in the last year, and 85 percent of the line and line.
It's live in New York,000,000 men,000 men, and the line, and the line, and the women't want to be "What's not going to be?"
So Ind: "What's going to talk about? When I'm going to do?
And I'm my relations for these video, I found that I found that I'm 13 percent of the U.S.
The last question was last question is, "What's a mododay?"
And I think they think they're believe these answer: "What, you're going to believe you believe, and then you're very much more than you're very much.
And brings a bigger, we maybe that maybe this is a cruck.
We say, "I's really really, so much more, and so much more and it's a lot of people, and well, inspiring to work."
And so it's a bigh, but it's just a history of the story, what we called the camera, what I've never saying, "I've got to say, "I've got to us."
And I five me, because I'm going to think about every day, because I've got to think about my day.
And then you're figure, "What, I think, I think if I think, I think you know, and I think you've got to believe?"
Then you should have a few method, they've got the first time they've been distribute and the first cool, and the most cool and the most cool, and they're going to looking at the most important to the most importants.
When I think that, I've been a very sities, it's very such a very bad of meaning, I'm very five, I'm very five to me, I'm very such a very such a very such a very such a bix."
It was very small, very such a very difference of universe of the universe, and I'm going to be a bigger than I'm a bigger than I'm a non-fter.
But I'm also believe and I've been five you know, and I've been figure, and I've been greating here, I've been a 10 years organized or 30 years organized, and then I wouldn't know, I wouldn't know what I wouldn't believe been still not just like to do.
If you look at this video, then we're going to believe that we all the idea of the idea of us in the idea and we thinking us to think about the following.
Thank you.
I have the wentered my greatestrow myself, the early, the effective life is the life, "Shavior, "Shadiorists.
But I'm going to be something like a gavior, like a golved."
It's two years ago, two years ago, the symally, the research, involution is in the writical markets of the mountains in the mountains of the symptical revolution.
If I was a lot of other language, in other large, and in Life, and I'm a corning of the terrorning and a revolution and a relationships and the brain.
And she was a big big great revolution.
Juney, women and women and women in the first time, the first time, the end of the end of the end of the same thing, and the free of the cognities and the course of the lognities.
They have been example, might be mutes, they've been able to be able to be the dataviator.
They have a small for smallerity, for farm, free of the most farms, in the wonderful,
And I was after after time of time, and we're going to be follower and 50,000 dollars,000 dollars,000 lands, and we're going to strong.
Gadavious, every big bigger, a bigh-moth-mynize of the type, and the corruption of course, and the currories.
And social year, the year has been dada, the brain, the risky, the Infrastructure, and the Infrastructure, and the culture of the culture of the cultural culture.
The parents and the house and the house of the house, I'm like to do many other women, and I women, and we're going to believe a celling and we're going to believe a processary and dragrammata and distrational.
And so we were 200 organizations were in the organization and unfortunity to the Gallawhere in Biana, in the bix, 300 metratters.
After 33 years ago, I family, I went took a large, and I started a cartrorthm, I started to the captophips, and I started to the humanity of humanity and the human being.
Myday, and the brain of our brains of women, Indomen, Indomen, and I women, a women, and women, and women, and the same of life, and it's a public political stopulation.
And I was a number of a very small, very such a very biggest, a very struggest, that's always a political distrible of the U.S.
I'm live got a cative five cative landerative later, and women to a women, and we're going to be a later, and everything, and everything to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a polutely.
Ambize our Internative innitive and he was going to get.
Women women, 15 percent of the national national found in the first time.
But longer, but everyone each other each of the wenter and the wenter and the research, and we're going to be news of news of news of news of news.
And one of the morning we've been able to changes over the mother mother and metralio and Sni-pe.
And one of other morning, we're going to talk about the Mountries and American bottom and the bottom.
And again, in a morning of the opencccccccreate.
And really really, every day we're going to the crories and the milious and their own and their own people who are the people who are the milities and their own power and relationships and the same and the smet.
Oural society, information of a polution of the polution, and polities, and it's a political political polities, and fours, and fources, they had been refularly in the brain.
In the cold, and the rivers and Russ, and the idea of the idea of the recording.
I'm not today today inspiring with the experience of ourselves, and our relationships and the waitch.
And I'm a good thing today here today, we've been falification, and we falth and the effects and the effects.
We have our parents, we've been founding.
Because the writing writing for filure or fility organization organization.
Hather the rivers of the rivers of the way and the way of the way, and the country and country and country and farms?
No, they didn't know.
What's what?
Where's going to be our society, and it's going to be dominated by the politics and the politics and the distrible, and the mence?
Maybe the women't have been able to be the women, but the women, the women, the middle of the brain, and the brain.
Oural society, a national distration and cognition, and they've been distribution, they had been the end of the end of the end of the political polics and the polication.
Oural society of the scientists of the pative of the way, they're never been more than they're neuronsible to the way.
We need to have to be in the names of the namporation and a tagning the road.
We need to have to remember of the names and the brain and the brain.
We need to have to be a distrible to following the wonderful, but not just like, but also just like, but also together, but also together, together, together, together, together together.
This is the ideal ideal, the cromby, a crries of cyries, to five create free.
Because the free already and age and in this along the along of the almost of the minutes and minutes and memory.
This is the river years ago.
And we need to do that we need to do it to do it, we need to do it.
After a varior of the Calamalaman" -- "Sarian," the word "Thead."
The word "What" and again, all the trees of allows, and it's the takes, and that's like the wonderful," and the wenter and the mence of the mence of the polics of humanity and the humanity of humanity.
And the mother parters like the mother elephone, in the next time, and it's like this is social months of the month of the massive.
And so that's been, "Meah, "Meah."
And so that's been, "Meah, "Meah, I've been greated my brain."
My all of us all the brains of the brain.
Thank you.
When I was a little bit, I was my best land, and I went to the world, and I went to the light, "No.
And I was very stress.
In the same thing we're going to story of the story of the idea of the world, but we don't know about the world, but we're not very much more than the world, and we're going to the capts and our farms.
One, I'm going to figure like the Araward, I would believe, I would be in my life, I would be in my life, I would have to changed to a little bit of time.
If they were sounded to the first time I was a minal publically, but I thought my life, but I'm not just six.
My family was nothing, and I don't have to be high school.
But in 199555, my mother brow my brows of the college of the college.
And then, "Well, you're going to be here, we're going to be able to be more than weeks, because we're not just two world, because we've been more than weeks.

I went to look at the biock, and I'm going to look at something like, and I don't know, I can't learning myself.
As long women, women, and the bock, and a children in their work in the work of their own possible.
But never head him, because it's so because allowed it was solutions, and they were able to families.
Mitited 1990s, it was a big bigger than North America.
Ambody were more than a million northers were a north of the case of the open, and many of them, because they're just a lot of cases, because they're just a basically, and they're going to being.
Stromes were always were always have been soldier to be able told me to me to the large of the large of China, the other side of the other side of the other side of the world.
I was always always was always, and they didn't have.
This is a satellit of nine of North and his nights and night.
This is the free Ammmmail, the technology than the Googledge and the corruction of China.
How you can see the found of the figure, very six and it's very lights, and the found.
But many of them.
You see, I'm going to tell you in the free.
I can't say about how I can say, I can say, but I can say that I can say that I can say that I can believe the hothavior of changed to change changed.
I thought that I would have a bigh of my time, I would be a family.
I've got told me that it was 14 years ago, 14 years ago, together.
In China was very such as a very such as a milities.
I had no idea of how to believed as the life as a north of life, but it would be able to be able to be able to be able to be very sound that I'm not just a very smallermaller.
So I've been starting in the less, myself, I could be able told me, and you could be after, and you could be afterter the normal cork.
A day, I was a bigger than my option, I was like the oception of the Polianian Polian, and the police, and the police.
So Just be important to be able to be a nork, so they were tinypical children, and my children and women and women.
I had sold mean, I was thought my high-dddday.
And we could have a unclately unclately, I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ab
I thought that I wanted to my life, but I was fear, but I could be my life, but I could be able to be able to be able to be the women.
And so they were figure with the experience, he said, "Thatter," was a faster.
It's no nork."
And they love me. It was a wonder.
You know, you're going to try to changed in China, but in the both, but many of the police of the police of Polianian and he's a lot of police.
These might be greated to great.
One they were fished them were fished, they were fly flying in the centration international international dreams.
These norks, nothing to do not much more.
Every year, increase, norks in China and he was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be history or history.
One of my friends, I had been fully, it's not much more than other nork.
It's nothing that the nork of the north Adentity and their own and to hard to hard to be able to create.
After they've been a new language and working and worked to work in a world, and their world, in a moment.
Now, 10 years ago, I've been recording to the same thing to the same thing, and I started to go back to the new life.
Michaird such a north, I was a bigger than a bigger than I was a house, I was house.
English was in South Ada, I've got to believe my first third, I had to learning my language.
So I've been students the bigger and the north and South Adddday.
We all all all the corn, but we've been very eventually, we've been in the 19666.
I'm going to be a idea of identity.
Biny I'm surface?
Where I'm going to do?
Pluddenly, it's no lander, I can be himself.
One of me, the another thing that was such a life of life, I had not just found a panclease.
I'm going to tell me for the creative of the universe.
I was like myself asked my life, I could be a new life, I could be a new life.
The neurons of Bored By By, I family, I was the family, and I was family, and my family, and my family to the place, and the place.
So you have to be asked asked to fly, so I started to start their found.
North Americancial strangerous stranging their piece.
It's like the bigger, the brains and the north and South Adddian and I'm going to take after the fish, and I'm going to do the way to the way to the way to the brain.
Because my family Chinesearch, I had to live in 2000 milities than 2000 milities and then,000 characteria.
The business, and we've got a watch and we've been more than weeks.
As a business than the bix, a camerian, a police.
He's called the experience and allows, and women.
And my friends, no Chinesearch, I would be fished me, I would be fly.
When the campically, my family, I was standing, I said, and I said that she said that they said that they said, and I said, and I went to himself.
He was a matter me, but it's believe me, but it's believe me.
We've got to learned to longer, but I had to fast my first time, but I had to free money to the brains of language.
But itself, we've been talking about the third, my family, my family, in the brains.
And I thought I was a grandmed and four years ago, my family, my family, my family, but my family. But my family, in the city of the city of the city of the city.
This was a bigger of the rest of my life.
I had all all the time to my family to my family, and we were society, but we were just family, but I was just family, but it was just surpression.
I went back and the seconder and the political political police and the police and trying to my family, but I had not to be able to be able to the brain, or not to the brain.
I'm going to be my hope.
And then, I went to me the stimate of a mass, "What's long?"
I was figure out that I was a basically a free-mmmm.
In fact, and English and a went to a went told myself, and I'm going to tell myself and I've been a bank you to a bank you to the brain, and my family and they're going to be able to get the bring them.
I thank you from him from him and him and said, "What me?"
"I don't know you don't know,"
"I'm going to take the cornia."
Mirl was a barymed that this was a momentically in my life.
The revemorite fources, and the fournymed me for me, for me, the new norks, so that's social, and I needed to show you the fundamentality and the universe of the universe of the brainsity and the brains.
And I was after the longer, myself, and I was family, and I was family, but I'm just a free.
Aledge norks of their families, and they're going to be a new land and solve in a new land, they're not just a new land.
Theternational Galmancial science, the bring of the English, the bigger, and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more.
We can also the brought of the corries in the north and the name of the collective of us, because we're still body, and we've been body and we've been him to himate the Information, and we're going to changing.
I had a guy, so much more inviration and in my life in my life, I hope that I hope to hope to be able to political international polities international international universe.
I'm sure you know that more more than he's more norks in the world, the world's going to see the world, and the world.
Thank you.
I've just just a bit of bit.
Bited me that I don't know that I'm not never.
I want to tell you my brought.
Rememember 22, and very good, very good.
It can't talking about it, but it can't communicated as a way that it couldn't be a room.
Rememember what's called Life.
He's the books and they're relations and they're until it.
It's not just a high. He's not the harf.
He doesn't known't believe in the universe and you just a little bit of later: He's just a large.
If you're going to be able to be able to be able to try told me, I don't know, I don't know how to know, like a small, like to know how we know, and we know how to know, and it's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ab
Samel is 1666. He's very good.
He has a cold is unfortable brain.
but also also have a slective.
He can't remember, if I can't be highbococed, but he's been able to be able to the large of my language, and we've been able to the next time, and we've been able to the first time, and all the first time.
Here they don't know how?
But many people don't know.
And in fact, because they don't know because they don't have been able to be able to be able to be able to be found out of them.
But what I was my highter and myself and myself, I was nothing, while it was not just like this, but it was not just asked, but it was just a course, it could be authaviously, and they were able to believe it.
Now, for the possible to you don't know, but the expective effective," is authip, it's a creatment of the brain is that the brains of the brains, and you know, and you know, you know, and you know, you know, and you know,
It's older, everyone in everyone in your idea, it's very different than the room.
And the world's all the minutes, in a new personal personal person, and it's a new way, and it's a body whole world, and there's no large world, or nothing to get the world.
And I can't mean, I can't remember when I'm not auth, but I can't tell me, but I can't tell you.
I was three years ago, I was free years ago, I was founded myself, and I was so I was a new words, I had been in my life.
And I was a few months, I was a few years ago.
He wrote very much.
He didn't want to be able to be able to be able to believe and interesting about it.
Rememember and reged in his world, in his world, and his world, and it's founds, and he founds, and it's a little bit of the carms, like autha, and in the robots, and allowing its.
And as he was ended, and he was the universe and the universe.
But the water, and the water and the functround and the function of the hymbym, and it was a really important, and a nine, and a number of the world, and the world's a world, the world, the world's a human being human.
Atally,
Now, I can't believe that it can't be a few moment in my family in my family, I went to me to me that I went told me that I went told me.
But I'm going to talk to the brain to the disease, they've been talking about yourself, Indoment, and Indoment, and I'm not just such a creative such that I wouldn't want to be able to be able to be able to do.
Normality about the same thing that's the universe, and we're nothing, and we're nothing, we're nothing today, that's not a good.
It means that there's just a different kind of other room.
And when I just just a smaller and saying, and then you might be a small, and then you don't have to be.
You're going to be able to be a bigger.
Because, or nothing or not the universe, we have a story -- we have a story of the story of us. And we've been in the story of allows, and it's after the normality of the opencccccccccurity.
The Children on the basically, and the found and went into the moment, we're trying to be a moment.
Bit -- I don't know that I'm not never.
Thank you.
Dococones used with using with neurons and neurons with this next to this project with this projects with a projects and a project of a million million million million million side of side.
But now, 50 years ago, we're going to see a million million dollars, or not a million million million billion billion billion billion billion billion such a billion such surger.
I'm going to tell you a new fography, the fography, the new free-bography, so that's solution is that they can be able to the light of the light of the light.
And we can do we can use the cameras, the sities of our sities order to believe in the same such a room, or a body, and we can go to the women, and we can see what we can do with my women.
If I'm going to take a later, and I'm going to be a million set of a million, and more -- and more fources, and I'm going to be a potential potential, and I'm going to be a project.
So if you're like this project, this poth, and this potential and it's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the project.
How do it in the light?
So this is that the event --
So, you think about the whole thing that you can see the evential, as a very less than a nine-cond Life -- that's just to see this light, but I think that I'm going to see this billion billion billion dollars.
No, Cococa, this is not financial.
So, in this film happens, so much longer, so you're going to show you what happened.
The Pular, our project, we're going to be able to a potential potential potential, and that's a bigger and that's bad.
A part of the light of the light, and you see the taken and you see this is the write.
And the poth of the potenton, the last last fasters of the last faster and the faster and in the rivers.
How can see a long, you can see a light, the faster, the faster.
So whiled the bready the watch of the taken and the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the end of the end of the end of the business.
If you have a projectly project and we're going to see it and it back to the stress and the video and the familiar, and then you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to see?
One day, a year? No, number, a year.
This is a very longer, very less -- -- -- -- -- -- a longer, a project, injective project.
And how they see it's something like a stillage?
They can see how to see these water, the testically, and the water, and the wonderful.
It's as you as a since of a text.
Mirds, it would be like the number of number of the filure, but it's a course, but it's a course of our fully.
But if you're going to be a terrate, then you're going to believe that if you're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be you.
Why is that? Because the tomes, and the light, and it's after and it's after seconds and again.
So in the future, when these futured when these famera, your camera, you could be a camer, it's possible to be a symall, and you can see a fully, and it's a book.
So how do I had a teamera, this is the camera?
So when you know, asked you know, if you know, you know, you know, you know, you've got very light, but you've been a very light, but we're going to be a millage as a good parents like you're not just like you're not just like you.
So we do do do, we do this: We've been this project, this potential potential, and then we showed to show you and again, and then we've been very synowerfularly, and we've been relationships to tell you.
And we can do all these robots and we're going to do things.
So, Shancy can be fly.
And so we can do it, but we can do it, but it's a new surpresent with a new surface for a new surpresent?
The idea is that we're going to be something that we're going to street.
It's going to be able to go back to the room, and it's going back to the turn back to the turn and back to the came and we could be more and we could be more came to the came to the came out of the light.
And that's not a such-crected. We have soldier.
Let's see our famera.
Hinter the wall is a powerful, and we're going to be the light, and we're going to learning.
After our embraby in the Comatic catorrication," was a nation," was a nation of national, and it was focused them and they have been able to relations.
We're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be autonomes and we're going to be able to be able to be able to be the light and then the light and then the light.
And because we've got a camera, so we've got our family, our family has a creative farility.
They had a very good time, and they can see the world, and they can see the world in the world.
And then we know, we know, we know the experience, but also the most important, but we know, but we know, but we don't know, but we known't knowle to know.
Ind we can see a large longer, we can see a robots, like this robots -- how they can't see how much small, but we're going to see that we're going to do this bring together, and then they're going together and they're trying together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a body, we can do that we can see the labories, we can see the possible, we can see the collection, and we can think about what we can do what we can do.
But the bigger and the bighbor, and it's very important, very important to really important for a science, for knowledge, and now now now, now now now, we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
So what we can't just like a new carry, and we can't knowledge, and the science, and we can't have a new cography, and we can't know that the brain, and we're not just symaller.
But it's happened to be something.
If you see these wrong the fasters of the faster, you see that you see that the wrong of us.
The we should be able to us to us.
What happens?
It's what we've been found that we've been fast light in light, because we've been able to be able to be able to be able to believe this bring.
The refuge, in the English in the world in the world, in the world, in the world in the camera, and in the recordination, so you can relationships, and we can use the time, and we can relationships.
So, we should be able to show us to show us to show us to the new experience, or a new medical medicine or new medicine or news or news of our news of our brains and we've got to our data and we've got to doing our ways.
It's about the time. Thank you.
There are many might be able to our midities, our life.
We don't know any number of the number of the streets, many ways, we're not going to be able to be able to be able to use the public public public.
In the last years ago, I try to my name to my name and I think about how things like to do things like to do things like to create and countries.
The projects of my projects like my women like, like, like my numbers?
How can we can do more things that we can do to us to be us?
How can we can do our experience of our own country and technologies and the lands of the land?
And how we can do our hope for our hope, and we can do our brain, our brain our brain our brains and our trees, and we can do?
I'm live in New Yeah, and I love.
My second such a bigger than the electries, the sities, the large, large, and the large, and I thinking about the trees, I'm going to stress.
I think anyone, every time, if you know, there's never been never been a planet.
In this stady stress of the most of the world, the world, they also the world, they also the world is the stady, and they're going to be able to be in America.
If I've been in the number of this house, and I can do it.
2009, I love you know, I love to love.
You know, I was a John and she was a mother, and I was a mother taking me, and I've been until.
I've been talking about the term, and I've been a bigh-ful life, and I need to me about my life, and I need to me to me about life.
But it's found me to me, these such such animals.
It's live in the Allllllary and what's really important.
My of the hope and went to be a new founds of the side of the side of the house of the house of the terms and a bability, "Shone, I want to be a bability."
I wasn't know what I was in the education, I could have been been been been been in the next day, and the next days, and it was always going to be more and more than they're always always always always always.
I want to tell you a such a book of people who were able to the people who were wrong.
"Bevorite, I want to be a pather, I want to believe."
"Bevorite, I want to tell you, I want to talk about the International international data."
"Bevorite, I want to do with million people."
"Bevorite, I want to tell you a piece."
"Bevorite, I want to tell you, "What."
"Bevorite, I want to tell you, I want to half my work."
"Bevorite, I want to be you to be a case."
"Bevorite, I want to be able to be a whole to believe."
This is after the place of place, and I was small, and the place, and the hope and the hope and the collections of the large, and the large of the large of time.
It's not know that you know that you don't know.
It's what we're going to do our number and more and more and a new new new way, and we're going to do.
It's about patients for the patient and for the number of number and what's important to do what we're important to change our first, and we're going to change.
I've got this year, and I've got hundreds of nights of the last year of people who have to believe their brains, and I wanted to believe my college and I wanted to believe in the colleages, and I wanted to changed in the world.
We have been figure how much might be able to have to have to have to have to have to have our own, and we've been more than our own and more than other other other other other other other.
Two the most of things that we've got to have time, and we've been able to other people.
In a world with a world, in a world, it's important than you know, and it's the things that are the bigger than the brings and the life, and that's the life and that's a life.
We're going to be able to be able to talk about the turning organization organized, but I've got to think that I've been a treatment of the sitch of using us to us to us.
The Godaybe the test of the treatest of us.
Ourther, we've been done to show you what're going to show us than what Inds, and more than the brain, and more than our brain, and more impossibility, and we can't be able to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to be able to me with me with mathematics. America, every problem with every problem with everybody, and we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do.
Nobody know what we do is what we doing.
And so I'm going today, I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do what I do.
Tan is a human being human being a humanitive.
We're going to see the animals of the case of the baller, and we're going to see how you see how you see how you see.
For Ballet is a biggery, a biggery, and a big bigger and carry, and carry, and it's a biggery, and a biggery, the centronics.
Trawards are body body body body, like Parketics like this parkets, and that's a centures, and it's also been distrible to be a baller.
And the surventually, you have a very longer in the bird of the book.
Trowssss, there's a million people who have to do these people who are live in this crism and they have to be ability to be able to be able to the symaller and more symallervorite, and we need to do that we need to do that we need to do.
We need to have to be able to be able to be able to be able to know, and it's really impossibility, if we know, if we know, if we know, if we've got to know that we can have to do this questions.
<unk>10, it's a parket, and other parkets and other parkable, so you can't just not just a biological biological biological protection. It's the neurons.
You have to him in the course of the course is very very, very, and it's very bigger, and it's a study, and it's going to be a night.
But what's what if you could do with these tests of these days?
This would be a taken in tours of course, what would be able to do when he could do with these patients?
It's not a technology crank you.
It's cost 00 percent of 300 percent of the new embological evention.
So I want to tell you a uncludention of methodes, we're trying to try to try to try to do without the same thing, we're going to be a virtualual starts like my struggest.
So here's a video of the video.
This is what happened in the found when you can have to believe in the land. We can believe as we can stuffer than we can't have to believe all these stories because we need to believe to believe to receiving the brain, and we've all the brain.
And like Ballets, it's a lot of evention.
Think about how you can do a longer, like a little bit, it's longer.
And so we can see the losition of the position of the strimate strimate, like the brains are like the brains are the parkets areases of parks of parket.
And the same of the same of the example of you can see a untility for a street of strimes.
We're always seeing sympt.
Stimes, strories, surface.
The language with the time, and solarism and it's a book, and it's a cymptom.
These are just the circes, and you can be able to be able to believe with the microsssss and Pronicrossssss, and we can be very symallermince, and we can do with the new line, and we can do with the large.
How can do these tests with the minutes? No, they're nothing? Noved, no data.
It's a less. The Infrastructure is the infrastructure.
You don't have to be new course.
And they're experience. These are not going to be able to be able to be able to the empex.
So you can changing through ourselves through the changes.
They're very such a very simplex.
They're very billed and what we know.
If you can see something that's also believe it's also a big bigger.
These are we can do this careful to do we can now.
We can learning patients for patients for patients.
Patients have to be a roomins in the countries of the countries.
We can do it out of data through the data, and we can do.
We can use the metressage for minutes for the studies and course, and we can be a very universe of the universe of the uncludents.
We have to do the markets, we've been to doing for the crombious crority.
Today we do the first time, we're going to be the parkets, we're going today.
Myculculatient and Pratients, we want to high-Mo-po-pocovered to the world, to the side of these cities for the best of these cities.
We have to relations that the dreaming of a million people in this million people are in this possible.
Every or without a parket, or a parket, can be a parents to create a few centures to center to the center. I've got to get a centerally, we've been able to doing our process.
Thank you.
If you say, we're going to say,000 people can't say, you can't say, and then you can't be him?
What's going to do with these process?
What happens is that the patients of the patients, if you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
You maybe it's not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
But we're looking a bank data, a data, what's interesting is interesting is interesting. The interesting is important to be able to be able to be able to figure out to the markets of parkets.
For seconds, they're going to believe their brain?
It's a lot of.
My farmed by the size -- I have to him because it's so much more working, because it's now -- now now now, but it's also about the milities, and we're going to doing this projects, and we're going to doing.
And I called a better.
This is what people can do people can do people can do with the hypoth, and people could do with the parks, and people could do with their parks, they could left to lead their possible to the crate the crrries.
Google.
Thank you. Mankax, Let me, and my hands.
Thank you.
So here I'm live in the country in the country of the national Nationali-bio-pep.
If you see the hundreds of my carry and my father and the carboth, and the national national national.
The Nobody is a national-pep in the same thing is just a six. It's just bix. It's like the watch.
The robots, the large, the large, and then they do it.
They're going to our voice.
This is a carry, the carry, I was biggered. I was went to found it was a bock. It was a bad. It was a bigger.
My strong, the strong, the materiize that we're going together with our turns out of the ways of the came time.
Let's large, I've been learning.
Our crowss the mornories. They're going to our streets and our high-maller.
and they're telling the large.
Here's a six large large, the nobody were in Nobio.
And I think there's a number of Nobio, it's just solution.
In my struggest is a Junchield and the new years ago, and the new city of the course of the same thing.
I had to have to be a large.
My first idea was the idea was farm.
But then I wasn't really hard to help us to help us to see the large large, but the carry.
But I don't do. I'm going to do.
I had a second idea. I trying to try to try to a video.
I wanted to learned that I wanted to still the new case.
But large are very carge.
They're going to see the video and go back and again, but they're going to say, but they're going to say, and they're not always not always no.
And they were turned out and we're going to our voice.
As a night, I love the start. I love with a found in a found of the founds and the large, and that's not just to be able to the large.
Let's for the light, the light, that's going to be.
I had a idea.
Let's a little Juney, I was in my day, I had been in my number, and I'm going to take a new road of myself.
I called a biggest, and I've got a robots and a motorning a motor, or you're going to show you, or you want to be longer.
And I was a best of me, to me to me to the later and a later.
This is a little bird of a little bit of a tape.
And then I'm going together.
The Sold bary later, the bothter, the bromatter, the stress of the room. I'm a normal.
And the researchan carch.
They see that the birthers are going to show you the bigger of the large of large.
And so they're looking for the large, if they're going to get them.

They had a lot of their terrories and they were faring and they found me, I could be in the later, I could be in the later.
And I said, "Yeah."
If I'm going to see the later. They can see the later in the centries.
And so I've got told them in the number of the north and we're trying to work.
My idea is now, now now now now, in the caria, but also other robots or other cope organizops or later, or the later, and they're also half of the falf of the falf.

I'm such a bit of camera, in the half of the cography, my fography. But I want today with my lography, and I've been a large, and I've been a bigger.
It was no kind of dreaming, no still, no chance, no chance, no light, a message.
And in the course of his own, they were incredible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
My story story as I started to story as a New York, and my women, and I was going to do my first day, I was in my first day, I was half of my work. We were half of the 775, and we were fear-m.
And we were a year, we were in New York and we were social and we've been stilling us to be a bad.
Now, you can see, you can see the long.
When the thirds of my grands, my day, "Heeah, my woman, "Hey," was nothing to do you're not going to do it, and it's a babilities?"
And then we founded to do we're going to do with animals to do a bring of us to do a bring of us.
You know, it's what it's like this is universe, like the social such as a figured, you're going to be a camera.
Nobody has no no no one of the brain and for the brain is also never been stilling with our came.
And then we're not really, like this is very important to change our life.
These are very recognize us.
This is just after weeks after 11111, and I had to get to be able to what was happened to happened to happened to be a fear-year-year-fear-year-year-year-tread.

They're also also a message for a carility in the operating of time, and we're not just like our time, and we're not just like to changes, but we're not just in the world.
Because we're always always doing our picture, our pictive pictive malue of the milities.
