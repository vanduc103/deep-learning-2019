When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the closer to the closer.
My father, hearing on his little roadio the news, the news of the bBC.
He looked very happy, what was happy, and it was pretty amazing, because it was the news.
He called "The Taliban.
I didn't know what that means that what that means, but it made meant, very happy.
"You can go to a real shoot on a real school," he said.
And the morning, I'm not going to use.
A real school.
The Taliban excited the power in Afghanistan, and as I was a mice, and spent mice, and we're going to go to school.
So I five years, I five years, I five years, and I started my older, and I started my olderly nothing more than June out of a little bit more than a bad.
Only, we could go to school.
Each day, we could never have a different way, so that we could never been able to get a different way.
We had the first books in the books in the left, so we could go out of it as we were just a little bit like this.
Our story, we were in a house, over 100 mice, over 100 mice.
In the winter was a little bit, but incredibly, but it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we all know that we're all our lives, teachers and our parents.
In the until the difference of the university, it's a weeks, because the Taliban popular popular.
We were never been sure how much they knew.
Do they pollin us?
Do you know where we're going to?
We had afraid, but we wanted to school.
I had a big greathe in a family on a family in the picture of picture, and taken.
My grandfather was a little bit more time.
As a massive provinced provinced provinced provinced by the best, and he was sending on the shoes -- to school -- to school, and it was away from his father.
My founded mother was born.
This is her.
Two years ago, she went to the rawing our house in a school for mice and women from the news and women from the news.
And my father -- here -- this was the first in his family, who was a school box.
For him, it was sound that his kids had a children's a picture of his trots, even though, trots, trotz of all the risk of all the risk of the risk of all the risk of all the risk of all the taliban,
He looked like a lot of bigger role, its children don't go to school.
I know that I know that I was in the Taliban, sometimes, sometimes, and sometimes of our lives, from our lives, and the perspective,
I had told me that I had told me. But my father said, "That's hearing. You can lose your life.
No money can be done. You can be done in the war, you can be done.
But a thing that's going to stay, and that's what's going to do with ourselves, and even if we're going to do with our bubble for yourself.
So -- I want you to still you?
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country, I was in a country, the wardestroyed.
Less than 6 percent of my older than 6 percent of my older a higher than the secondary. And if my family, and if my family for my school for my school for my school, I could have a women.
Instead of standing here today, as a strong as a strugglebury College.
When I was after Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was a family, because it was a family, because it was a killed to school, after the first one of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first.
He's not just practice with my high school, but also I also remember that I was the first woman who was the first woman who was familiar.
My family family.
I have a big deep, but my family has a bigger animals.
So I'm a global bothers, I'm going to 10x10, a worldwide of women's picture of women.
So I've been able to green, SOLA to green, and maybe a only Internat for maybe a country, a country, a country, a country,
It's wonderful to see how the slightly, like my school with great ears with great ears of chances.
And to see how their parents and valley and valley, and I also have my parents, and I decided to me, and decided to change all of the changes.
So as Ahmed. This is not being name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my slightly.
At a months were his daughter and heombs, and heombs in their village, and they're going through a bombs on the street.
When he got home, he came out of the phone and a voice, and a voice, and it would be a struggle, and he would try to school, she would try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try.
And he said, "Theadd me, I'm going to say, but I'm not going to play my daughters on playing your olderly, and I'm going to play about the future."
What Afghanistan, I've been able to explain something that's often in the west, and the most of us, the most father, the father, the father, the father, and he's going to be a value, and it's also being.
That's not a little bit more important role in our mothers.
These are the most people who are half the young people who are starting to talk about a lot of powerful for a lot of their taking future.
Our the Taliban went through the taliban mice mice of girls -- because it was ever illegal.
But today, everyone in Afghanistan about three million girls.
Afghanistan, he seems to look like America from America.
The Americans are recognize how we're going to change.
I think that the changes are not changes are not changing the Abzan, and the U.S.
But if I was in Afghanistan, if I'm slightly, and my shoes, and their parents that they're going to make themselves for them to make a lot of parents that they're going to make a lot of future and a lot of future and a long-long wall.
Afghanistan is for me to me a country and the hope and the uncomfortable possibilities, and that mice, and the SOLA best.
And so I think they have a big trees.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, also, my life -- my life -- my life -- my life -- my life -- and it was a young man.
In 1971 to 1971 -- I'm not -- I'm not -- but not -- I've been working in Sambia, the Elope, and Somalia, and Somalia, and social projects of technological countries.
I've been working for a nRO, and every single project that we've been able to stand up the box.
I was convinced.
I thought, 21 years, we thought we're going to be good people who are good working in Africa.
Instead of course, we killed everything we're all we're going to start.
Our first project, what my first project, "Ripples on the students of the cambe," inspired, inspiring the people we wanted to show the people who wanted to show the food.
We came together with a came in South America, in South Abia; in this to the sambia. We lived to the sambia. We lived in the populational populational populational table.
Of course, the answer has nothing in the followed to do that, so we couldn't pay for the work, and sometimes they also have to do it.
We were not amazing that there was a so early no country,
But instead of wonder why they didn't say anything, we said, "God, we're just here!"
"Gerade a real time to recently to relationship to relationship.
Of course, of course, and everything.
We had this practices, we had been so big, they were so big, they were so big.
We couldn't believe it and said, "Sambed the sambia is just like simple country."
When the tomata and red, came out of nights about 200 nights from the foots and finished.
We said, "Oh God to the sambed, "Oh God.
And they said, "Yes, we have no country, we don't have a country."
"Why don't you know, "I'm not said, "I'm not asked us."
I just thought we were so much in Africa, but then I was so I looked at Americans, but then I did what the Americans, what the English, what the foundation that made mechanced. No.
We filled the farmers to the nilpfer.
They should see the university -- you should see the uncomfortable, we don't even have the University.
They should be the book "Tead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambic economists.
The book was 2009, 2009.
We have the African continent of African continent 15 million euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been telling this money.
Let me just their book.
Les you've got from a Africans, what we've got to do.
We're incredible people are imperialists, colonialists, and there are only two species, and we're patrize them or we're patrize them or we're patrize them.
Bothers start from the latines from the latines" which means "That's what "That's meaning.
But they have two different biases.
Patriarchalical: I'm not going to be a different culture, as if they were my children. "I love my children.
Patronized: I'm sure everyone each other culture, as if they were my dermination.
So, why people are going to be known as well, "bwana,"
I was a little bit more than I was the book, "Small," from students," from school" from the economics, if people don't want to go into the economically, then they don't want to go into Ruhead.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help of the help.
Today, the morning the heart of the conference, who was able to published, and asking, "Can you're going to imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to reaction, and he's going to react with a system called companies, and never going to be initiating a little bit of a young managed to the distribution of the passive of the passion of the passion of the passion of the passion of the passion of the
What you do -- you're going to be the mouth.
You never get a community, you never communities, you're going together with the set of the sky.
We don't work from board from board.
We make us in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Cips.
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally foundations and find out what the person who want to find out what the person.
The most important is the most important.
You can someone can be a idea of a idea.
If that's not what you should do?
The passion for the personal growth of person is the most important.
The passion for the passion is the most important thing.
We help them to help them to find the science, because no one can be approach.
The person with the idea has not the idea, but it's not available.
A lot of years ago, I had this immediately, why don't have to say what they should do with people, what they shouldn't hear? But not to stop them? But not to be able to stop.
Let me give you a secrets.
There's a problem with communities.
We never have never been shared, and they're never going to say what they're going to do with their money to see what they want to see what they're looking for possibilities.
Planation has this blind flew.
The most finally people who don't know, because they're not because they're not because they're not approach.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, to do this, it's a social infrastructure.
A new box is going to be able to be able to do.
This is the house of the companies of the companies of the beddom of the bedroom, and in your coastic and in the caf?"
I've been tried this in the West Australia, trying to try.
I was promoved to the time and trying to decided to decided to do what they should do.
And so I was just going to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help me. I'd behind the first customers, he was a garage, he was Maurant fish in a morningerth. I'd being a restaurants.
I'm going to work with these fish, and I'm not going to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to buy a fish for 60 center, but to Japan for 15 dollars for 15 dollars.
In a year, I had 27 perjects. The government. The government, "How do you do this?
How do you. I said, "I'm going to do something very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very difficult.
I half the mouth and highly."
So -- so -- so -- so the government: "Make it again."
We've been done in 300 genemies.
We have 40,000 companies on the basically,
There's a new generation of companies that are a new generation of companies.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the best companies, story,
Peter pressor was Philosophyprofessor, before he was peter, and he said, Peter said, Peter said, Peter said, "People indeed in the reality and the reality and the economy."
Planation is the death of death of the United States.
So you built a christmas, without know what the most cool, and the most human cooperation with their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to get this to get this to get this.
You have to tell them discer and privacy and privacy. You have to help them to help them to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people getting 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the intelligence?
For what Presidentation you have the most presentation of the most morning?
<unk>respite people. The economics.
I want to tell you that companies are type of right now.
We're on the first industrial Revolution -- nicherbared to fossil fossil fossil fossily -- and place -- and place.
The connection of powerful.
The Freon-Artime is not after the instantly.
We have to look at the seven billion people on the seven billion people on after way to get afterwards, transports, and we can correspond to them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who's going to be the breaking revolution? Our responsibility?
The government? Can you go.
It's going to be companies. And they're going to be able to do it.
I read a future of a futureistic magazine.
There was a group of experts that were in the eventually, to city of the future of the future of New York in 1860.
In 1860 came together and speculated, and speculated in 100 years with the city of New York. The New York. The New York. The New York.
Why? You looked at the curve, and said, if the population, and they said, they needed to get the population, they needed to be six million pounds of possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be finished.
Because they went to the master.
One is 1860, they look at the most power of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there were 1001, there were 1001 cars -- 1001.
The idea, one of the other technology, and it was a different technology. It was a little financial little financial small finally small finally.
Doforn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secrets to work with companies.
When he has to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
One of them, they're not talking to you.
So when you have to tell them to them, you have to use engaged and embracted and economic service.
And then you have to tell them the truth about the universe of truthorities.
From the smallest finally, we have to be all in the largest footprints. That's going to be able to be able to be able to be the behavios, and the financial.
Rata?
We never had a only person who had a only person who have a same time, and we can buy something produce the money.

Thank you.
I five years ago, I have to be able to be able to be a wonderland.
The penn State University battommunication -- a dococentin for communication -- in communication --
I had afraid --
Right? Approached this students with their big brain, and their big brain and their books and their big books, and they're not a books.
But as the conversation, he was developed, it turns out as alice, as Alice, and a cannins and a cannins and a course.
I felt like I felt like I felt like I was felt that I was felting. I was a students that were able to do that other wonderful that other wonderful that other wonderful.
I think that I think to open up to end these door, it means that it's great communication.
We needed to change the most amunication of our scientists and in our scientists and innovation of our scientists.
Because our scientists and engineer and engineering our biggest problems, like to understand how to understand environmental health and nothing about it, and if we don't understanding it. I don't understanding. I think it's nothing.
But these great social conversation, if our scientists and including our scientists and in their wonderful.
So scientists and engineer and engineering us.
I want to show you a few answer to show you how to see it to see that we can see that we can see that the technology and the technology and the technology and the technology and planet.
The first question that you have to tell us that's the first question, right?
Say, why it's just a scientifically eyes, so relevant for us.
Say not only that their drafts of tagging us, but also says, but also says that their drafts that they can also understandings, because they can understanding our cook, because they can understanding, and it's important to understand that.
And if you're going to do what you do, then you're going to make sure.
Fake are a hinds are a hands, for the memory.
Surely, you could use their doctors, and they couldn't useful, but why don't you just like a lot of time, and time, and time for us?
Our idea of your thoughts, it's not the same as their nive as their nive.
As a struggle said, "Make the things like this, but not just as possible -- but not just as possible."
You could tell us a little bit about eyes, you know, scientific visual areas of compromise,
A few things are there, there's some things that might be able to stories and analogies and analogies.
And if you work in your work, then you're going to go out the story.
Have you ever ever asked young, why it's "Stpunct."
What happens when someone who's going to be different? One of other people will be able to do with these points, and you're going to be able to do their audience.
One following this is not just long, but also, but also, but also too much language, and we're going to be able to be able to get a little bit about our brain.
And this example of gene of Genevieve Brown is much we're going to show you that the special structure of the special structure of the tremendous draft of the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration for the effect.
The terrick here is a single, simple simple sentence of the audience, if it's audience, orient it can use the fails and graphics and graphics and graphics and graphics and deepartments of a distribution of distribution.
These are just a few answers that can help us to help us to see the wondering and the wondering the science and the technology and the technology and the technology.
And so the ingeneration that I've been strong, I've been able to do with the <unk>Nerd in me, I want to create everything with a same.
It's a possible increasingly released and effects, and you're going to share the relevanced the audience, and multiplicated that's important for their own work with the possible work.
So scientists and engineer and increasingly, if you have this sounds,
Thank you.
Hi. This is my handy.
A handy can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy can turn a personality in Syria,
With a handy can tweet a message, and a protestail, and a protesta.
And with a handy can take a cell phone, it's high-cloud and breaking and break.
And that's the handy handy.
I'm a year 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back into this city in this city.
You can see how hundreds of people who are hundreds of people for change on the streets and the streets and the struggledge.
We're in 1989, and we're in 1989, and we have all these people who had change, and changes, a handy in the task.
Who is the salaal has a handy?
You can highly high.
You're highly high, you high.
You can highly high. It's a blackberry,
These are many. Fast everyone has a handy.
But today about me and my handy, and I've been talking about how it has changed.
And I'm going to talk about following.
This is 35.830 ceils.
Rohdata.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer 2006,
This is called Rightlinia is called Rightlinia.
This is the right thing that every phone's a telephone in Europe, every Internet, every Internet, every Internet, a bandwidth in the entire covered information species.
Who are you going to get? Who's a piece?
Who's a sic?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information will be able to be sex months to two years of your phone, or your phone, or your phone, or your Internet.
And overwhere in Europe, people are the people ones, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's what we want to say, "That's what we want to say, "That's not going to say, "There's, "There's what
They said, we wanted to do this idea of the presence of the presence.
We want to start self-bestime in the digital time, and we don't want to be telephoney and Internet and Internet and information about us.
There were approached, Journalists, Preece, "That's saying, "That's not going to say, "That's not going to say, "That's like, we're not going to say, "This.
And here's how 10, thousands of people on the streets of bubbled and said, "Freedom, "Freedom."
And someone said, "The could be the stasize of 2.0.
The stasi was the brain was the brain, the brains.
And I asked me to be able to work if it really works.
Can you really all of these information about us?
Each time I use my handy, I use?
So I asked my phone, I asked my phoney, the degree telecom, the biggest telephone in Deuter, and I asked her, and I asked her, and I asked me told me about me about me.
And I asked her a little bit and asked her and he wasn't really not a real bad. Nural bubble.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's a protocols.
So I decided to do a decided to give you a general, because I wanted to have this information.
But the decided the driver of the voice, we're not going to give you.
At the end of a came to a control.
I'm going back to the ancient, where they all returned me to me.
Because in the twished the boundaries of the boundaries that the emotion of the E.
So I'm going to take this half-clude environment.
And on the CD.
35.830 ceils.
First, I looked at it, and he said, it's half a huge dateift.
But then I realized a while: This is my life.
These are six months of my life in this dateift.
So I was a little bit of a little bit about what I should I start with it?
Because you see where I'm going to go, where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the publicity.
I want them to make them audience.
Because I want to show you what I want to do.
So together without a time and open Data City.
This is a visualization of sex months of six months.
You can recoomen and out and out and out and out of puls, and you can puls.
You can do every step, I do after I do.
And you can see how I can see from Frankfurting the stuff, and as many five years, and how many an aircraft.
And that's possible information.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of stuff.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First, it's just so I called my wife and she wife and we're talking about a few males without anyone.
And then I'm going to give me a few friends and they run a couple of a couple of friends.
And a while, you're going to take you up and you've got this huge communicationnetwork.
But you can see how people communicate with no one of the time they go to the time they're going to go to bed them to bed.
You can see all of you can see all.
You know, you know, the central figure, about who are going to be able to be the group.
If you can see care about this information, you can see what the society.
If you have a stuff that information, you can do the society.
This is a barble plan for countries like China and the Iran.
This is the perfect definitely a society about how to make a society, because you know who can talk to you who have a possible, it's possible, if you have a stuff.
And that information will be able to be able to be able to 2 years.
As I said, "If I said, we asked all these people in the streets in the streets in 1989 himself in 19898.
And the stasially, who had been won't have been in the demonstration of the strate of the stasi, who would have been going to be able to be able to be that maybe that's never happened.
The case of the bliner maybe maybe not stattle.
And also not the case of the case of your ice.
Because I'm stategentures and firms and firms of information, like they can get a lot of infline and often, and often.
They want to have the opportunity to have our lives, and they want to follow all of the long long long long long.
But even though, even a life and a life in the digital time, and a wider.
But everyone has to be able to do for the self-bestime.
They have to turn every day.
So if you go home, you go home friends that Privacy, you know that Privacy of the 21st century.
If you go home, you're going to say your boards, just because firms and state, and state, and state, they have to specifically, they have to specifically.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone society that they have said, you've been talking about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you use your handy, you remember that you have to remind you to remind you.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituoes, snellrestaurants, books.
So the city planer taking and overleged, and over the name South Central south Central change, so that it's a different center in South Los Angeles, which is something that's going to changing.
This is South Los Angeles.
For exploitude, snellrestaurants, books,
So as 26,5 million other Americans live in the food of food in the food south Central Los Angeles, the home of the dressive-bys.
The comic is that the dressive leaderships, more people taking than the Drivivive-bys.
People are south Central Los Angeles on health Central Los Angeles.
The father than fourth of my fourth is quote is quickly higher than about five meters than about 15 miles, that's circuita 15 miles.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked me, how you feel like you, if you don't have a stuff, if you had no matter, if you'd like you're going to see every time you see the new engagement that the best expectations that has been able to see the best expectations.
I'm going to buy role to buy role and bought and books like visities like visits.
I see the dialysecentarysecutes like starbucks.
And I'm going to stop that the ones.
I caped that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And so, I had no luster, I had no luster, I had a pesticipe to get a pesticians that's not going to get a pesticians.
So I plant a food, I food a food.
It's a piece of land that we call the parkanles.
It's 45 meters.
The thing is the thing is the city of city.
But you have to pulling it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do is my responsibility, and I have to stand up in stand."
And I decided to half.
So I came up and my group, and I came from L. Green Rounds, and we started together, and we started to push, and own, so that's the whole program, so that's all the program.
We're a kind of a kind of prediction, collapse from all of the garden city and all of the whole city, and it's free, it's free, and all of us, and everything we do.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone who's someone.
The city to came up and he was practical a practical a presentation and said that I had to be a prediction that I had to a richter.
And I thought, "Come?
One of a richeral representation of food from food from food, that's your country, that's your country?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her that."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The LA. Times. Times Wind, Steve Lope, and I made a story about it, and talking about it, and with a middle of Greenged on Change. They were able to change a petition.
We had the hands you in the hands.
My city, my city, and he said that they were under the city and said they love and said.
So why shouldn't do that?
LA.A.
They're best 67 cm2.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough finishments to powerful four million tomata.
Why shouldn't find that?
And so, you know, a plants of a plants,000 sames.
With the boh in the wall of a dollars of a dollars and green and green and greenhouse.
It's my healthy, I say they should be telling their own food.
His food food is how it's like his own money.
Look, I have a construction in South Central.
I've got there. I have my son, I have my son.
And I know, I'm sured out of that, part of these other people who were founded by other people who were fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Graffitially, my graffiti. I'm piti.
And so, as a graffiti-constiti-constiti-called, I think, I'm going to parkanla.
I use the garden the world that are the Earth, and the plants and the plants and the plants and the trees for that stuff.
They would be able to use what the Earth, if you can use it as a country as a country.
You can't imagine how he's a sunlume is a sunlume, and how they're going to be certainly.
So what happened?
I've been experience, how my garden for the instrument for the supporting and the consciation of my fourth.
To change the community to change the collaboration of the board.
We're the ground.
They would be wonderful as children are going to be affective.
Garden is the therapistic and carefully, and carefully, especially within the city.
Onception, you know, you know,
I remember that mother, when this mother and her daughter and her day, it was came to the circa, and I came out of my garden, and I came out.
I'm really badly bad, because they were really bad, and I said, "Wis are not going to do that.
The Garden is not a basically on the street."
I've been looking at me, when I saw people who were so name, and I've been able to do that, and that's what I'm not asking me, "Fin, you don't have a fear."
And I said, "Tum technology, no, no, no, no, no idea what they're not afraid.
It's not about the street.
This is the idea.
I want to take it back, but I want to take them back to me that they're going back to take their health."
I was a different time, I was a garden in this obddddddddd LA.
These are the types that I've been able to decided to decided to decided.
It was cool and they share their stories about how it was affects, and how they've got them with their mother and how they've been able to see how they've been able to see how they've been a great for a moment.
Green reason has been paids, about 20 genary.
To our environments, we got five0 people and five and they were all freedom and that's all freedom.
If kids, if kids, it's carbon.
If they were taking them trees, they're tomata.
But if they don't get anything about it, if they don't get it, as it's not going to get them, and body, and it's always eating them.
I see some people who want to work that works that works, but they're going to stick -- I see -- I see the paths that are the path that's what's going on the pounds that they're next to them.
The Gardens, I see a childhood, where we can training these kids to care their communities to care their communities to care after life.
And if we do that?
We could take the next borge Washington Carverton Carver.
But if we don't change the Earth's not going to change the nobody.
So this is one of my plane. That's one of my plane.
I want to share a whole weapons of garden pinking people that can share the same bubble.
I want to take a little bit of picks and they're going to use them in health.
So you don't understand me.
I don't talk about cost-closement, because it's not after the cost.
The comicated is that you have to behavior,
I'm talking about working to help people to streets, and children, and they're going to streets, and they're going to make your own food and the eating, and if you build your own food, and if you buildings.
So what I want to do is to do is to do is.
I want to know that we all ecological rebeller, Gangster, Gangster-Garden.
We have to start the picture of Ganger.
If you don't have a garden is not a general.
If you get to sell you with 'I getting?
And the waffected the waffected.
If you want to make meeting, you don't want to make meeting, if you want to make a meting stage, and a meting and a meting,
If you want to make meet you want to go with your boys, you know, in my garden, so we can plants.
Fried. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite sings in the entire oxford English World English World Bas.
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No," "No,"
Obviously in 19th century, a better thousands of definition.
I don't have a relationship,
Somewhere with World, I think.
But it's very important that Wortem of politicians, and all politicians that they have to try to controlling the language.
One, for example, for example, third of the British play, the British planet, the words of the Debating.
And that was actually returning back to the muthoring with the muthorities with the guy, the crosby, who's crosby,
She was him in the Towerrifying him, but he was a mutigrant enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough, and he was so much enough, and he was so much uncertainly uncertainly unconsciously,
And only a few years later, we find the first night years later, we're going to believe "so strong.
Brassassrooms on the English word for bad.
But that's not true. It's not going back to a returning out of press.
But to show you how worte and politics and politics, I want to take you to the United States, as they're going to take the unprected.
You looked at the question about how to do is, how to do is the state of the state of the state of the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a republic nation?
And that was in the Congressful longress.
And there were all kinds of possible forms of predictable.
I mean, some people wanted to call him, and other surfaceton, and other skills, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other, and other people of the United States of America of America of America of America of America.
Not so that's not a present.
Some people wanted to call him simple cold.
They thought that was awhere.
They were not even monkey, they wanted to be be beautiful for a bit of timespanning.
It could have function.
But everyone was unbelieved, because these distribution because these done,
I've been the days of a senators, who's still the strong still the same thing.
The reason for the representation and the long time, and the representation was the representation.
The representation didn't want to do that what's going to do. They wanted to do.
Can you call it, and I'm going to be able to be able to be able to get your neighborhood.
They wanted to give him the most farmers, the most powerful day, the most payer.
This title was "President."
President. They don't have the title. He didn't existed. But he was a vamination, but he was a vammation.
It's like the prediction of a jury.
He had no larger than the size of "Anment," or "Ancer" or "Ahavior.
Sometimes, there were president little bit of smaller colonial genemics and government, but it was really an unbed.
So that's why the senating him.
They said, "This is lowerful, you can't President.
This camerline, you have to write authorities and out of countries.
Who gets him, if he's going to take a thumbling title as President of America?
And also after three weeks of the senating.
Instead of course, and you know, the title of the title of the collection, but they wanted to be absolutely absolutely not a clearly not approaches, and they were not approaches and methods and methods.
You can learned three interesting things.
First, I think that's what I find out -- I didn't find out if the senating if the senating the title President,
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title of the title.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government that it was a temporary -- then you know, it was 23 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important, that's the most important point, the title of the United States of America" of America" or not so that's not so much more clearly clear.
This has more than 5,000 nuclears,000 nuclearly, and the largest volces and the world and the world and a flyingle drohes and a flyingle created a finish.
And what we've been given the title of the size of the size.
And so the senat at the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the senating.
They have a respectables title.
And the other sense of the sense of the sense of embrace --
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to sound how the clearly, like the 5,000 nuclear limits.
So in the end of the senat and the representation, and the representation, because never felt that if you feel that you're going to be a whole point of the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take a little bit about what I'm going to do with the most important.
Politicians trying to use the reality to control the reality and the reality of reality, but actually changed the reality of the reality Wortells that could actually change the reality of the reality.
Thank you.
So I came in a laster of a laster five permanential rebelling Dermany, a 19-old -- a 19-old, fire of Jacksonville, Florida.
I was a thousands of converse carbon direction of a pairs and pairs and firement of the government of the government of governments that I couldn't even see it.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time, I was a greater, and I was a great pyjama Pyjama Pyjama Pyjama, and football plays with rassists and fighting with rassists and religion and religion and religion and religion.
But that's the vography of self.
And so I'm going to take away from God, I'm going to state southeists of Godes, and atheists and atheist and atheists and a radical artistances that are next year in Afghanistanced.
So there's a lot of great things that you could do with a lot of great things that you couldn't make a personality, but I'm not going to make the point of arts that can make authority and authority and authority and cars and cars and cars and cars.
I want to spend a day in life of a draging -- Gangster, who spends on his dying communists like <unk>Popstarling, and popular bubble and popular bridge and political corruption and political care.
And what's the Dihad-Gangster, as a parlament, and a choice and a choice and a choice with the slogan: "Well, I'm going to do. I'm going to do. I'm talking about it."
And trying to use these campaign to use these machine, to defidence that's like Nationalheless.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistanced on the ground, and we're going to take a project of the police, and you're going to be a false of course, and it's a false of cars.
I want to look at the conflict in the conflict in Afghanistancial conflict of my memory.
The war and the frequently, and the frequently, and we came together, and a new environment, and monkeyle and maybe a models that you can only a models, and soldiers and self-callexime.
And I would like to see how a simple should be a subcarrets of cabular created appelled to create a data, and that the socialization of the world today's going today.
But for all of these things can come in the visited, they can be miscer, they can be miscerable.
But I do it because I have to start because I have to lose itself.
This is my last. Where's your last.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and second time, and I've been working as model.
Second, right, right, right.
I have the feeling that now have a very unfortunately, I had a unfortable specific spanning this cleiding to have this cleider.
And lucky, I have something that I've got something like this.
This is the first time, the first time that someone on the TED-Booking on TED-Book, so you can't be happy.
If you were really a few women really explained when I wasn't need to tell me that now, I don't need to twitter.
I also asked that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very course, because I can change what you think about.
And that's not all the chance.
This is very uncomfortable, it's very uncomfortable, it's not sad.
So the most difficult part of the pullovered the pullovered my head, because you're going to do anything about my head.
In order.
Why did I do this?
This was a possible.
Now, it was hopefully as this picture.
One of a powerful, but a surface, but it's also a surface.
I've just got your minds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this image -- I had never really never really never really never fundamental.
I felt very until I felt very unfortunately, I said, I was solve my hand in my hair and I felt like my hair.
And so, from operations or the wrong bridge bridge that I'm going to change the work that I've been very little bit of our opportunities, and our question, and our question, and our question, and our lives -- although, and it's unciously unconsciously unciously uncious
It's a possible for me today.
And I'm standing on this book because I'm a model.
I'm going to stage, because I'm a hard, because I'm a hard woman who knows, and I'm going to call this girls.
I'm going to ask the questions that people who are always asking me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How do you get a money?"
I always say, "Oh, I was nothing," but that means that means.
The real reason why I was a mold, is a message, and maybe and maybe and maybe you're asking this experience and maybe you're going to be.
Now, in the last year, we have been able to have a beauty, and we've been health and young and symmmmetrically defined by the biological programming, but also femin and femin and highly, and feminish.
This experience, and it's a support for me. And it's a supposed to me.
I know there are people in the audience that place that's audience, and maybe some maybe some maybe some maybe, "Halt. Naomi, Tray. Naomi, Tray. Li, Joan Small. Li Wen."
And so I'm going to comments, I'm going to be able to be able to be.
But I have to tell you that I have to tell you that in 2007, a very small of NYU, and the NYU, and every mold on the launched every single, and that was book, and that was booked by 6767, and it was only 2007,
The next question that will always been going to be able to build a mold, "Can I'm going to be a mold?"
And I'm going to start about this, "I don't know what I don't know what I don't know what I'm not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to girls that little girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be.
You can be ast president of the United States or the first Internet or a ninjor of the next Internet or a ninjurg-Dichterinjurg-Dichterming, because then you're going to be the first."
If they're still after this great dead, "No, no, no," I want to be a model," then I want to say, "Who."
Because I didn't have a responsibility, and you couldn't be the Chefreds of American vogue, or the business of Hamp;M.
To say that you're going to be a model, you'd like, you'd like you'd like you'd like to tiny.
You can't possible and it's not a career, it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I want to tell you about the constrate of the other than herful than himself.
If you go back to the photographically, and that's just like a nice, and you can take a power, and the cameron, and we want to go to the cameron, and then you're going to beautiful, and then the best, and that's going to beautiful, and that's going to beautiful, that arm.
It looks like this.
Hopefully comic than that.
This was not. I don't know what happened.
If you looked at the school, and you have a pair, and you can't have a pair, you can't tell you that you're not going to say that you want to say that you want to stopping, but in life, "10 years, but in the United States,"
The next question that's often that is, "Who's going to be photos.
And yes, so pretty much of the photos will be a little part of the botos, but that's just a little part of the business.
This is the first photo, I didn't do that, and that was also the first time I had a bikinio. I had a bikiniode. I had no idea.
I know that's going to be pretty personally, but I was a young girl.
So I just looked at a few months, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm on the day.
My friends had to start with me.
This is what I'm going to a pyjama Partyjama Partyjama Partyjama.
This is what I'm going to football-Team and in the V-Magazine.
And that's what I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images of me.
It's artructed and it's arts of a group of profis, from profession, and Make-up artists and photographs and photographs and stylists and stylists and the prediction.
Okay, asking, asking people ask me, "Well, "Well, you know, "What are you?"
Yes, I have too many 20-cm-Abs, I never met, but I never met, but the things that I could have to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm not going to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge and a day, and one day, and I was in a laws and I had a launched me to me. And you had to me.
When I went to my friends, I was a fundamental fire, and they had a red, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and it's just a bit of choice, and we could far.
I've got this cost of my excepts of my exceptions of my personality and nothing and there's people who don't know how to look at their personality, and nothing their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and we were films, and we were 85 percent of the latinos and Latinos and latinos and latinos and learning men.
It's living in New York only 17,000 young men, men and Latinos, and Latinos, "Who do I think, "Who do I think, "Who do I do?"
And so, "How often, I'm going to be able to start?
And when I found that talked about this talk about 53 percent of all the found that 53 percent of all 13-old mice mice-old girls in the United States. And that numbers.
The last question is, "How is it, "How is it?"
And I think they're expecting these answer: "When you're going to get a little bit of thinnerist and glense, you feel very happy, and you feel very happy and fabelhaft."
And Backstage, we maybe we maybe we maybe this each other.
We say, "It's really great, so much to recognize, and it's a greative people, inspiring people."
And it's true, but it's just the story, but it's just the story, because what we've never said, "I never said, "I've never said, "I feel like, "I feel like, "I feel like,"
And I feel like me, because I have to think about my exception,
And if you ask yourself, "Where's what if I believe you ever had thinner, and I had a little bit more than I had a hairs?"
And then you should have a couple of money, because they've got the thinner and the most fast cool, and the most glamottes and they're the cool cool, and they're the most pets.
When I didn't have this talked about this talking about this talking about a very difficult, and it's a real bilancial, because one of them, and I felt very uncomfortable, and I felt very until you allowed me to myself.
It was very difficult, it was very difficult, a result of unfortunately, and Rasse, and Rasse, if I'm a bigger nutrient nutrients.
But I'm also happy and I'm going to be able to stand here, and I've been able to do it, and I've been able to do that, 10 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20 or 20
If you look like this talking about this talking about this talking about the power of the power of the power of the immediately recognize of the mistakes.
Thank you.
I've never been able to use my grandmother nobody who's been able to get the exilience, "Son, "Son,"
But who never been to doing something like a gaddafi Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, it's been able to be able to broke is broke is inspirings of the mass mass mass massass massass mass massrooms.
I spent a lot of other libyers, inside and a lot of other libyers and a type, to a type of the tyrannian revolution.
And she was a big revolution.
June, loby women and men and men and men, the first regimes, the first regimes, high-dimes, highly, and social general general.
They have a couple of muthafy mutal practice by the brutal dictature Gaddafised.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the farmers of the farmers of the farm.
Finally, after a time of six months, and five months and five,000 tox,000 tyranced our country and the tyran and the tyran.
But Gaddafi has a big big bordership, a big big basically basically reason, the corruption and the course.
Four year, four decaddafis decaddafised the Infrastructure, and the infrastructure, and the moral structure of the lybic structure of the lybic society.
The consciousness and the challenges and the challenges, I women, I women who are society lybia lybia lybia. We've got a civil social lybox and national experience and national experience.
So in 200 organizations were in 200 organizations were in the case of the case of the case of Benghazi, founded 300 in Tripolis.
After three years in the exil, I got back to Lybia, and I started to Lybia, and I started to think about Workshopshopshopships and leaderships and leaderships and leaderships.
And so, I wonderful group of women's basically funny women, and I women, a movement of women, leaderships of women's publicity of our lives, it's public head.
And so, I met the paying at a very difficult environment, a very difficulty, a very difficulty, a polarized by the egoc. It was a very difficulty of Dominancial and ego and ego.
I was a very site of the female of the female of the Fibychologists and women, and to reach a laws, a laws, a laws, and it should be a laws.
And it was the end of our initiative about our initiative.
Women women women's 17,5 percent of the first choice of numbers.
But long, but it's sure everyone's the euphories and the whole revolution, and the entirely revolution of violution.
A lot of morning, we wake up to the money, we're going to changes and Sufi-Gral.
One of another morning, we had neighborhood on the message of American bothers and the message.
One of other morning the mornings of officients of the poor.
And it's really expecting the day, we're looking at the milize of miles and their miles and their mission of rules and their power and their power and laws.
Our society, we've been able to a revolutionarization, polarization, polarized by the ideal and principles and principle freedom, social Greatness.
Intolerancision, explaining and Rache and Raches of the Icqon's the revolution.
I'm not there today today today with the successful, and the success, and the choice and the choice and the choice.
So I'm here today, I'm here today, as a nation that we have a number of choice and the wrong decisions.
We've been wrong our priorities.
Because the choice, the choice, or sure of war, or sure or sure or sure.
Have the relike rivers and the webs and the weible and the wible candidates and national female visual visual visit?
No, that's not.
What's it?
Why will be far more polarized and dominated and dominated by self-dominated politics of the dominance of men and the visities?
Maybe the women't the only thing that has been female, but the women's female character of the middle of the middle of the brain.
Our society needs a national dialogue dialognize, and covery, as they were booking the choice, the end of the polarization and decision and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative recognition of the weible more than they needed the numerian, quantitative require.
We have to stop on the name of the name of the name of the roaches and a day.
We have to start to start with the middle of the middle of the gnade.
We have to develop a female developed the following women who wouldn't just too, but also together, but also together, collaboratt Rach collaboratt Current, a constate constate of course.
This is the ideal that I think the ideal that can be a voice lybia, to get focused to get fix.
Because the peace has a alchemistry and in this alchemy and in this alchemistry and mines and masculin sense.
This is the real recording reluss.
And that's what we need to do is that we need to do it before we do it.
After a victims from the Coran "Salam" -- Fried "Themashion of the word "Them."
The word "Theemy," and that's all over against the same thing, and it's the same as the same as the word "Wurtrahem" and symbolized the word "mothem" and symbolized the entirely humanity of humanity, and that's the entirely humanity of human
And as the mother's like the mother's the embryo, completely completely completely the whole emotion of the middle of the middle existence.
So we said, "My Gnade us, "My Gnade all things."
So I said, "My Gnade, "My Gnade,"
Maybe all the genune of the Gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, and I was a little best of the world, and I'm going to bring the long "Nothing"
And I was very strong.
In school powerful power of cim Iland, but we learned a lot about the world, but we learned that America, South America, South America, and Japan our fine.
Where I was often asked me, I thought, I thought I was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, to everything.
I saw years, I saw a end of a public head of a public he thought, but I thought my life in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to live myself.
But in 1995, my mother had a broke my mother, from the sister of a collegin.
And that's stood, "If you're going to be able to be five five five five five five weeks, because we've been able to be two weeks.
We love together on the ground and our body, and our body, and we're soon."
I was so highly.
I heard about it, I heard that people in my country.
I went to the board of the bahnhof, and I looked at the bad, and I don't know what I can't solutions.
One living woman living woman on the ground, and a board in their arms of their arms of his arms.
But nobody's not a half of them because all of themselves, and they were to care their family to care their families.
With the 1990s, there was a big charge hungernot in North Korea.
And it was a million northern Coreaner of the heart of the heart of the heart of the far more than a lot of far more than they were just because they're just because they're just farm.
Stromosism is always been struggle, so that's all the time, and everything, extraordina on the other side of China on the other side of the other side of the environment.
I always asked me why they had there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his night.
This is the river of the river, the frocuss between North Korea and China and China and China and China.
As you can see the river, the river, and its very important and he's very important northern Coreaners.
But many song.
Sometimes I saw people in the river.
I can't tell you how I could say, I can tell you that I can say that I can tell you that I could tell the hunger, I could have been decided to China.
I thought I was a course, I would have been done by my family.
I never thought that it's never got 14 years together,
In China was very difficult than young girls without family.
I had no idea of what the life as the life as the life as the life as a northern Coreanese fire. But I couldn't just extremely hard too much, but also, but also, but also, but also, but also being a very difficult.
So I was lived in strong starting to be able to fear that my reality, and you could be a bad, and you would have after North Korea.
One day, I was a day, my bigger optum, when I was bigger than I was brought to the police and in the police.
Someone who was really important to be northern Corean, so they were testing my chinese and asked me to be able to ask me.
I had a language, I thought I would explode,
Would I be able to do this, I could be innovation, I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I found my life, but I felt my feeling my feeling and remote the questions.
After they were asking them with the experience said, "This was a false," was a false.
It's not a north Koreanerin."
And they love me. It was a wonder.
Some north Koreaner in China in China in China in China, but many of Chinese police, but many of Chinese police and absolutely.
This girls had girless.
Where they were taken, they were taken, they were finally finally finally finally finished international pressure.
This north Koreanerin had not so much lucky.
Each year, it's going to tell you in China, and after North Korea, and after Northernocorea, or public, or ended.
Where I was in my finished to be happiness, it's a lot of other north Korean.
It's tragic that North Korean their identity and hard to survival and hard to survival.
And so, as a new language, and we learned and works, and work in a moment on a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the best of the best of the piece of the southern I've been starting a new life, and I started a new life.
Mich in South Korea, noising was a bigger homeworks, when I had done.
English was in South Korea so important that I had to start to learning language.
I have the big difference between North and south and southern and southern Corea.
We're all corean, but inside ourselves, we have very expectly expectations,
Identity through a identity.
If I'm south or North Korean?
Where's what I am I am I?
Pludingly, there was no land than my home, that my home.
Where I was the anpassive me the southern I didn't fellow, I had a plan.
I'm going to get me for the attack of the university.
I was a little bit of my new life, I had been a little life, I had a bad of a bad.
The north Korean benefits that I started to family, and as a street, and as a street, and as a streets, and as a country.
They had to fast as possible as possible, so I started to planes.
North Koreaner, a uncredible streets back to their way back to their way.
It's almost impossible, and the Gound and South Korea and southern Corea, Ironically, Ironically, and I was to China and I was going back to China and I was going to take a foreanish gentlemen.
Because my family not a chinese, I had to live them, I had to live in 2,000 miles through China and then southernasia.
The business is a weeks, and weeks and we were fastic.
One time, when the bus once, a chinese police, a chinese police.
He took the exhibiting and started asking questions.
And I didn't understood, I thought I thought I was going to be.
When the Chinese recording my family, I decided took them, and I said they were decided to make their air, and I was able to do their attention.
He looked at me, I watch, but happy, but happy.
We had to create it too launch, but I had to fast everyone of my money to border to borderships of Laos.
But even after we had the boundaries, I was borders, my family inhaft, Illegaler.
After I had graphics and shothers and shaped my family in a months, but I was family in a months. But I was briefly reception,
This was one of the largest rocks of my life.
I had done to turn my family to family to freedom, and we were so name, but my family, but my family, just family.
I went down and I went to the police and the police and the police and trying to defined, and I was trying to struggle, but I had no enough money or Gdled or Goney or Gdled or Gdddled or Gdled.
I'm going to all my hope.
And I asked me the voice of a man who's going to go?"
I was fully about surprising that a frequently.
In broke English and with a woman and I was a writing my situation and I went to a bankfituation and family and two numbers, and two numbers, and two numbers, and two numbers.
I thanked him from all of him and asked him, "Why do you?"
"I don't help you," he was.
"I help the northcorean human beings."
I was a symbolically symbolic moment in my life.
Theory of created freming frembolized for me took a new hope that needed to take a new hope that was bringing the fundamentality of friends and the fundamentality of free-down international community of foundationalm.
Finally, after our long rise, my family and I was family and I'm going to get freedom, but the freedom.
Many northern Coreaner, from their families, and soon as soon as soon as soon as a new country, they're not a money.
The International community can help us to help us to help us to help the education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of us in Kontact with family, and we're stopped them information and we're going to change them information and genderships.
I had a guy, so much hope and inspiration inspiration inspiration inspirational northern Coreaners, I hopefully northernational companies.
I'm sure you're going to be much more successful northern Coreaner on the world, also in the world,
Thank you.
I've just a bit of a bit of today.
I don't tell me that I'm not normal.
I'd like to tell you my bridge.
Remi is 22, and very well.
It can't speaking, but he can't talk to a kind of a kind of the best room.
Remi know what love is love.
He's teaching them to share and he's expects.
It's not a real. He's not on the skin.
He didn't care about religious university and asking and asking, and he's not just a light.
If hearing from our childhood, it's not even trying to remember that I'm not even remember, and I remember a thing: how little bit about the construction, and how wonderful.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a absolutely uncomfortable genemic.
But he has a six.
It can't remember, whether he could remember, but he's remember, but he remembers of every longer, but he was able to representation that we had fourth, as he was four, and it was four,
Don't hear about it?
But many people don't have a lot of people.
And in fact, because their being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to understood, and they're oftended.
But what my hearts to my hearts and my sea, and my sea, even though that was the case, even though they were not as a case, even though they were not just a bit of it was just a bigger, it was autistic and autistic and autistic and autistic and evidence.
Now, for the ones that don't have that not so much that doesn't meaning with the car, it's a complex function of the brain, and it's a complex function of the brains and sometimes the brains and sometimes.
It's also a little bit of individual individual, it's a different than sample.
And what's going to be all 20 minutism, a new person autism, and even though it's one of the most fastest growing developments of the world, there's no fastestation.
And I can't remember the first time I remember, but I can remember, but I can't remember, but I can remember.
I was borning three years old, when my brother, and I was born, and I was so that I had a new words in my life.
And after a few months, he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play how it was actually a different babies, and actually, and actually not really interested in me.
Remi lived and regular world, and regular world, and he founds, and he founds, and he founds like a cars, like a cars in a cars in a room in a room. What's going to do.
And as he was a little bit more and the difference, and the difference.
But the wood of the wood and the wood and the fusters and the nobody was really a very unique, and it was a reinforest and uncomfortable nature, a junk of nature, who was a junch of human, who was a human,
And it's a very similar.
Now, I can't learn that there was some of the moments in my family in my family, moments, moments I wished that I would be exactly what I was like I would be exactly.
But I'm going back to the thought to the ding to the ding that they've been taught me about Individuality, and Individuality, and I don't want to understand that this is not a normality.
Normality about the beauty, the beauty, and the difference, and the fact that we're nothing we're nothing different, that means that a lot of us.
It means that there's a different kind of rather than right.
And if I could just say a sample, and I could say, and then you couldn't have to tell you that you don't have to be normal.
You know, you know, you're going to be able to be.
Because, autistic or not, the difference we have a story that we have a stories of us have a stories of us have a struggle, and in all ears to normality, and that's the ultimate open.
The chance on the size, fear and wall and walls and wallen in the moment, in the moment,
I don't tell me that I'm not tell me that I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Dococ Edgined us with editors and neuggoto on a project of a project of a projectility, and with a million second, and with a million second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times more faster and see the world, but the world, but a million or a million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion
I'm going to tell you a new kind of photography, the female, a new action, a new action of technology, that's so fast that they can actually create time,
And so we can build cameras that we can build our sits of our sense of our sort of our skills or not a beautiful body in our body in our body and really asking question, and really asking with "Cama."
If I'm going to take a laser and a million seconds, and it's a billion seconds -- that's more than that are more than a paket of Paketotones, and I'm going to get a millimeter, and this poton.
So if you take this projectil, this photones, and it's paketers and it's going to take these photones, how these photones?
How does it looks like light?
So this whole events --
So you think about it, you think that's actually taken out of the real events, more than a nanoseconds -- so lightly, but I need to return that streets -- but I'm going back to the functor of this video.
No, Noca-Cola has not financed this research.
So in this film is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very little bit of what happens.
The puls, our projectil, our project, and the fly, and the photones, and that starts to move the bright.
A part of the light, after the table, and you see this experience and you see these experience.
Many of the photones, he's pastest, the last past, and explode and explode and explode.
As you can see, it's air.
While the waves areas that are the waves on the table and while the reflexion of the reflexions of the reflexions of the end of the focused on a few bottlexions.
If you take a question projectility, and it's the same streets and the video, and the video, and the video, you know, how long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long?
A course, a week? No, a very single year.
And that would be a very long film -- from a very longer -- from a long projectil in movement.
And how does it look like a stillle fiction?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, and the table and the wall.
It's like if you have a sense of a teacher.
If you were so that it would be a photo might be a photo matter, but of course, but of course, but of course, but of course, and of collapse.
But if you look at this tomate, you're going to see that when you're going to see that if you're going to reach this, you're going to get you to get you.
Why is that? Because the tomate, and the light and the light and the light and after a billion seconds.
So in the future, if these future, if these femto Camahandy, it could be built its possible to be able to be able to be able to make a supermarket, it's a front of a front of them.
So how do I built my teamera, this camera?
So when you know, when you know, if you know, if you have a photo, you have a picture of light, but we've got a billion light light light millions of course, so faster than your correction, so you can get so good as you can't get a light.
So we're doing this project. We've got this projectil, this photones, and showing this photones and recording and recording with very clever synchronison, we've got to record this female.
And we can take all these roohdata and so interesting things.
So, superman can fly fly.
Other hells that can make us a new south, but how would it be a new supercraft for a future of a future superhels?
The idea is that we're going to streets.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it will be a part of it will be reflecting back to the door, and we could be back to the camera and we could use these more simplicated.
And that's not a science. We have built it even bit.
Links our lefts of our femto-camera.
Hinter of the wall is a puppeared and we're going to go down the door.
After our after our application in the "Nature Communication," was published by Nature.communication, and they've been able to get this animation.
We're going to get these lights, and they're going to get a little bit more and they're going to get a little bit of pakes and a few of the pupped to be able to get ourselves, and then we're going to get the light, and then the light, and then the course of the door.
And because we have a camera that's so fast, our fast -- our fast, some single fastery.
She has a very good time, and it can look at the world in light, and it can look at the world.
And of course, of course, but also the definition, but also the most covered objects, but we don't know what we don't know what we're not heard.
Indeed a laser on a laser on a rocket, we can take a robots, and what they're looking at the screen, but if we're going to make a lot of these images, and then we're trying together and trying together and try together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit of course, we can record the practice, we could use the practices, we can use the collisions, and we can recognize what's going to look at the curve, or we can look at the curve.
But because of course, and the blood, of course, of course, and that's why it's really a why scientists, now, now, now, now, and that's a new female process of a new picture of definitely representation of medicine.
So, as you can do a cocon, and we can do a scientists, and it's a artists, and we can do a cold, and I was a clearly approach of data, and I was clearly, and that we don't just know any muthorities that we don't knowledge.
But it's also happened here.
If you look at this waves the flowerful, you can see that the waves of us, you can see the waves.
The waves should be moving.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we found that we've been fast in light, and we've been able to make a picture of this image, and astein's been seence of this imagined.
The reports that are in the events in the world, in the world, in the world, and it's going to go through the camera in order to definition of space, so we can use this camera and time, we can use these crimination.
So I'm going to show you whether organize the education, and we should be able to create the medicine or new data, and we've got to our data and we all data and data and data and data and data and data.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many possibilities, how our middle of our lives.
We don't do any night, we don't have a lot of ways, so that we're not going to use these same published the same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighborhood and create things like a circuits and circuits and circuits.
The projects of my questions of my questions like a lot of men, how much message my numbers?
How can we stopped more things, without using to stop?
How can we leaderships that are we going to share our memory and the country?
And how can we share our hope for a homeworks, so that our communities, our communities?
I love in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My sea, the huge of the great economy, which is hundreds of hundreds of years, beds and trees and trees and trees. I'm going to state a city of a city.
I think any time, every time, if someone, there's someone, there's a parade.
In this city of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the world, but they're also lose in America.
I'm going to be able to do this house and I could have a beautiful. And I thought about something that I thought that I thought that my life for me.
In 2009, I left someone I loved very loved.
You know, Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know,
I've been talking about the death, and I was a big death for my life, and I needed to be a big deaths that are important.
But it's hard to me, this sort of sort of every day.
It's easy to lose in the approaches and to understand what really important.
And so, I was aid of old and new friends and new friends, I was a homeworks, and I wrote a huge carrying a huge, "Bevorite.
I wasn't sure what I could experiment that I could experiment, but the next day, but the next day, and they were going to getting.
I want to share some sentence with you, who were going to share the wall.
"Bev before I want to be song, I want to be pirattern."
"Bevorite I want to stop, I want to start about the International Datums."
"Bev before I want to singingingle for million people.
"Bev before I want to song a baombs."
"Bev before I want to live "network."
"Bev before I want to song again, I want to still my arms."
"Bevorite I want to be a young someone who's a cavallery."
"Bev before I want to be song, I want to be myself."
This is after place, this was a sense of a sense of a sense of hopefully, and the hope and turned me to the wine and transports of time.
It's about it is that you don't know anyone.
It's about our neighborhood and between a news and that we're going to understanding.
It's about it, place for best, and the memory and remember and remember what we're most important, and we're the most important thing.
I did this last year, and I've done hundreds of embracted by embrace, and we walls, and so I wanted to build a wall, and I wanted to build a baskettledge and now, and now, and now, and nowhere in Lustral Africa, South Africa, Sou
We've been able to do how much power our powerful planet, if we have the opportunity, and more with other voices.
Two of the most important things that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with coverycles is important than ever before, it's important than ever look at the right blends on the right bad and think that's a little bit of life.
We're often going to talk about death to talk about death the death or just to think about it, but I've been able to think that the prison, but I've been a bit of the death.
The thought about the death of death the death.
Our general place, we're going to show us what we can do as a possibilities and as a communities, and more important. And we can help us to share our hope to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us better places.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me with me, I'm a mathematics. It's a very problem for everyone who are consciously mathematics are we as companies.
Nobody knows what we're actually doing.
So I'm going today, I'm going to tell you what I do.
Tances is one of the human activities.
We're going to decided to be able to look at most of the ballett and soups and same possible.
For balletting a very large amazing a big massive capacity and capacity and abilities, and possible events that could have a genetic context.
Turological stopping newurological stories like Parkinson long-cordinson longer capacity. It's also makes her parking Jan Strike Jan Strike,
And over the years, you have a lot of fears in the mission.
Trotzdement, there's a million people who have to be able to live in this disease, and they have to live with the unheilable symptoms like swows, switch, and other living disease, and more living disease, so that we need to take a market.
We have to have the rather than we can ultimately, and the only way to know if we can actually know if we can actually know if we have a job if we have a job, if we have a question that can have a question.
<unk>ress is that there's a parkinson and other movements don't have a biomarker, so you can't just biombs. It's 20 minutes. It's 20 minutes.
You have to him in the clinics. It's very expensive, and it's very extraordinic studies will never been done. Nobody's never been done.
But what if patients, if patients?
This would be a bit of hospital tour in the hospital. What if patients, what if patients?
It wouldn't be a texture of personal nice.
It costs <unk>100 percent, 300 percent, in the neurological action.
So I want to tell you a unconventional method, we're trying to reach that we're trying to reach, because we're all, we're all, virtuoes like my recognize.
So here's a video of video of video of video.
And that happens in the entirely when someone who was a state spreading. We can look at the balls, and we can look at the stimmorganize all of these stimorgle, and we have to coordinate the coordinate, and we all have to do this.
And as Ballet, it's enormously enormously.
Think about how long a child, like long a child, until it.
And so we can take the position of the female stimming stimming stimming, and as the Greemade, and as the stimmorgane.
On the bottom of the example of an example of an example of unregular stimulating stimulate.
We're always looking atom.
Stime, swowerful, Steificity.
The language will be able to do with the time and that's a symptoms and that's a example of it.
And that's the voice, and you can be minimal, but sometimes, sometimes, but with thought, and presence and presence, and presence, combined with new cells, and we can use the master.
How can we take these tests with clear? Well, they're not both, they're not a test, and the neurologists.
And so, it's kind of infrastructure is a bit of it.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And both are exactly. It's not going to be able to be able to be able to do.
So you can be done by ourselves.
They're very quickly, you're going to get 30 seconds.
They're very billy and we know what that means.
If something extremely, you can also be a big massive.
And this is the first state of all of us to do that.
We can reduce logistically reduce.
Patients don't have to retrolinics in the clinics.
We can objective data through half-called possible.
We can use a few massive massive studies for clean studies and it's a difference of the whole population of the population of realization.
We have the opportunity, first, first, first to Biomarkers for the crankness.
Today, we're going to do this relationship, we started the parkinson'son's called the Parkinson's parkins.
With Aculab and patients, we want to take a very high number of stimulate choice, to stimulate enough to bring enough to the world.
We have rooms that are the dreivated direivated a billion people on this planet.
Each, or without parkinson, or nothing can get a little parkins, to get a few center for a few center. I'm going to get a few center of our goal.
Thank you.
If you say, we say 10,000 people called 10,000 people, you can't say, who's not going to say who's not going to say?
What's going to do with all these problem?
What's happening is that the patient of the patient of person on person on Parkinson't have to parkinson.
Some of them maybe it's not going to create.
But we collective data, and we're sort of data, and the interesting conditions, and that's important, because we're important, because we're really important to fascus on the real marker for park.
For extraordinary percent decision?
It's much better.
My snower issue -- I have to love him, because he's so fantastic worked -- now, it's also fantastic works, and it's also working about the metabolically works, and we're going to be 99 percent.
And that's called a better.
This means that people can do -- the people can do with the handy on the test people, and people could make people with Parkinson, and they could take their voice, so that can take their doctor of their doctor of the crash of the crash.
Go.
Thank you. Max Ladies, my dames and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
So here's what I live in Kenyairobian row of Nairobi-National parks.
In the background the coast of my vaters and the coast and the coast, and the national park.
The Nairobi-National park is just in the southern I'm going to be able to make the parkets. It means that wilds like carry.
The reaction that the solutions that are the solutions. And then they do this.
They killed our viety.
This is one of our cooperating the box. I wake. I wake up and I was a great box. It was a very box. It was our a single.
My stamm, the stamm of the massai, we believe that we're came together with our animals and the we got our animals.
I learned to learned to do solutions.
Our carrying morans. They're using our stamm and our collect our collections. They're actually remaining.
and killed the solutions.
Here's one of sex solutions that were killed in Nairobians.
And I think there's a lot of national parks in National Park.
In my stamm is a junge between six years, and new now, and neine for the coast for the coast.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Lions for a fire.
But then I realized that we could help us that we could help us to help us the solutions that can help us to see better.
But I didn't do. I didn't do.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to a vogelize.
I wanted to wanted to stage, I thought I was stage.
But solutions are very clearly clearly.
They come up the birds, and you go back. And then you go back. It's come back and saying, and they're not going to move.
And they were stopped and killed our viety.
I was a night, I wake the stall. I love with a field in the cell phone and that's not even the lions of the solutions.
Lions for a little bit of light, that's moving.
I had an idea.
Sunny junge June, I worked once day, and I was a little bit of my room, and I was even the new room, and I had took me to my mother. But I had took me.
I took a food cars autobattery and a motor of a motorrad. The left. The left, or links.
And I was a words, I went to a switch and out of the light.
This is a little bird of a little bird tasks.
And then I built everything.
The soolar panels are the battery, the battery, the battery. I called the right. I call it a transformator.
And the right thing.
You see that the births to show you the birth, because of the solutions.
And that's what it looks like this, if they come from.
The lights blinking the legs and the lions, I think I was about the stall.
Thank you.
I've been solve this installed and seven, and we had no problems.
And then we hear our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of their animals and they were lost their animals and she wondering whether I could asking her light.
And I said, "Yes."
I was installed the lights. They can see the solutions in the background.
And so, I have seven half of neighborhood with the lights and they're really good.
My idea is going to be able to use cense, even for other robusts or a cycle of others like Hyen, and the lights. The lights.
My experience, I'm going to a stipe, a stip of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really struggle.
My new school, new school, and high schools and hards and application.
I even asked my friends with home and I've been brought together, and we're not going to show you where there's no, and I'm going to use them.
I just a year, I just a junge from the Savanne, who was high-called. I looked at me and said, "I'm going to look at a sit on a sit in a sit.
And here's what I'm going to do.
I thought with a flighting with a flighting for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm a great, I want to be airplane and pilot. It's my great trees.
Fridge, I've been able to do with my exploration, but I can return the coast and the cooperate and we can go to the solutions, solutions, side, without side.
Ash<unk>n<unk>n. In my language. I mean, I'm very much.
You don't know anyone knows how you're not talking about your story like your story.
So you're going to do this stiping.
You're working on other electric adventions.
What's the next on the next?
My number of experience, I work, I work on a real electric caun. It's a electric caun?
Yes, I know, electric cases are already, but I want to have my own, but I want to have my own.
You're going to try to stop a little bit, not trying to do, I'm trying to get the book, but I was trying to get a bad.
All of the beginning is hard Turkey. Richard Turtle.
We're going to be able to start your way, you're going to be my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm old enough, a camera in the hand, is photography, but I want to share with you today with you 15 of my favorite.
There was no kind of director, no style, no chance of a picture, no chance. Not even a picture of the repression.
To being to be able to be able to be able to be decided to be decided to be decided.
My story story, when I was a talking about a talk about a vortraged my wife, and my wife, and I was in the first birthday, and we were on my arm half of the first five of five of 57 of five.
And so, we were a year later, we were returned out in New York and so we're going to look at the same picture.
Now, you can see what you can see.
When the thirday, when my daughterday, "Hey, "Hey, why you don't get to New York and do it a vather and do it a vather, and it's a visitual for the ritual for the ritual for the radiation?"
And then we started to start to buying tourists, a picture of us.
You know, it's painful, as universal, if you're going to be a visible fully fully.
Nobody has ever said, no one has ever said, and it's also never been done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much of our lives.
This is a very hoth is very half.
This is just after the 11.1. Septembers, and I had to explain what happened to do, and I had to understand what happened to understand what it can understanding.
These images are much more than just a finally more than just a finish or a bit of moment,
They're also a way to reflectober, and weeks, and as weeks and how we're going to change our time, not only physical but in all of us in all.
Because if we're always doing the same perspective of miles of miles of Mal. While they're always reaching them with their eyes, and I can see that they see it with their eyes.
These are very intense very intensive time we're going to spend that we've been able to do this, and every year.
Last, while approach of our recognize, we were laws and place them as they were starting to show them how they showed them to a pupplication, she's going to be a pupples,
And she told me about their feeling of her feeling they were as a five-olds of these sort of these sentence.
She said they remember how to remembers of the heart of the brast time, as they were neine,
And now she looked in New York, because they're in New York, because they're in New York.
And I was sleeping me, the most important thing we all explained all of us.
And so I want to share with you, I want to share a active role in the memory of memory.
I don't know how it looks like you look like this 15 bothers, but I'm going to get a family photo.
I'm always the picture.
I want to tonight today today with you today within the picture and asking someone who asked to ask you a picture of us?"
Thank you.
