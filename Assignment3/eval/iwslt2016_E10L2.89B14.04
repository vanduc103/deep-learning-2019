When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the clender of the clender.
My father was hearing on his little, gray Radio the news of BBC.
He looked very happy, what was pretty unusual, because of the time was, because of the news.
He called "The Taliban are familiar!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father was very happy, very happy.
"You can go to a right school school," he said.
I'm going to forgether, I'm never forget.
A big school.
The Talibanistan, the power in Afghanistan, when I was sixed it, and they spent the girls,
So I was slowly long, I five years as a boy and I started my older sister, my older sister, who don't have anymore, to a secret.
Only, we could go to school.
Every day, we could take another way, even though, but no one way, we went to where we went to where we went to.
We hidden our books income income, so we would go out like this, so we just go.
We were in a house, we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small wall while.
In the winter was, but incredibly, but incredibly hot.
We all knew that we knew our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
In the painting of the difference of the difference for a week, because the Taliban power, because the Taliban power.
We were never sure how much they knew how much they knew.
Do they asked us?
Where do they knew where we want?
We had anxiety, but we wanted to school.
I had lucky in a family in a family in education as important and turned into the education.
My grandfather was his time.
One of the outside of a province Afghanistan. He was building his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- my mother -- to school and became the father of his father.
My basically, my mother, but became teacher.
It's what they do.
Two years ago, she went to the ruhest of our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here was the first in his family, who was ever received a school education.
For him, it was clear that his children would be a children, even his children, even his daughter, drotz of the Taliban, drotzing every risks.
He looked like a much larger risk of his children, his kids don't go to school.
I know that I'm not exactly that I was in the Taliban sometimes, and sometimes of our lives, from our lives, and the perspective.
I had good lust to give you a good lust, but my father said, "Thather, you can lose your life.
Here's the money can be done. You can be in warside your house.
But one thing is going to be done, that's always going to be here. And even if we have to pay with our blood for your blood for your blood for your schools, we'll have to do that.
So -- you want to still?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I'm in a country that was destroyed by war, the war.
Less than 6 percent of women have a higher than the second higher than the seconds as the seconds, and if my family, and if my family would have been able to have a women.
Instead, I'm standing here, as a stolice as a stolice of the Middlebury College.
When I was back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was my grandfather who was in his family because he was waiting his test, because he was the first one of the first, one of the first, who was the most greater.
He doesn't just like my high school, but also with my high school, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the car.
My family believed me.
I have big dreams, but my family has greater dreams for me.
So I'm global bothers for 10x10, a worldwide for 10x10, a worldwide for the education of women.
So I've been helped SOLA, SOLA, and perhaps some internat for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school book for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the school students of my school with great ears with great earliers chances.
And to see how their parents and various for them, like that time, and I also troting my parents for me, and they decided to change all the voice.
So as Ahmed. This is not his name and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
At the one months ago, and he was his daughter and he's been in her village and they're the death of the death of the roads of the roads.
When he was home, came to home, and a voice, and a voice threaten he was going to be falls back to school, she would try to school.
And he said, "This is, if you want to say, but I'm not going to set up the future of my daughters on playing on playing your older and survival and about the predictions."
What Afghanistan, I realized something that I realized something that is going to be able to be able to be able to be the successful, the success, the success, the success is that the value of his daughter, and it's successful.
That's not too hot that our mothers don't play in our success.
They're going to be the ones that are the ones that are possible and convinced for a lot of their turns out of their tills. But in a society like the in Afghanistan is the unconsciousness of the men.
And the Taliban went to school hundred girls, because it was some girl -- because it was illegal.
But today, everybody in Afghanistan about three million girls.
Afghanistan, from America, from America, so different.
The Americans are seeing how our changes are solutions.
I'm notice that the changes are not about the changes and changes with the U.S. strups all over again.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I look at the school, and their parents who are looking at their parents who are setting for them to use them, I see a lot of promise, I see a lot of future and a lot of wall.
Afghanistan is for me to a country of hope and the units of the unities, and it remember every day, and it remember every day.
I mean, like I have a big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, even though -- my life -- my life was done by seven years of work in Africa than ever.
In 1971, I see 71, I see, I'm not -- I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Kenya, the Elbia, algae and Somalia, algaeks of technology.
I worked for an Italian NROO, and every single project that we're on the legs that we're on the legs.
I was doubt.
I thought, 21 years, we thought that we're good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did all of what we found.
Our first project, which is what my first book "Ripples" inspired by the cambeci, one that we wanted to show inspired the people that we wanted to show how food is going to show how food food.
We came to Italian Saatgut in South America, in this top of Tal, which leads to Sambesi-Flussi-Flussian population, and we led the animals and Zuci.
Of course, the answer wouldn't have an interest in it, so we pay for the work, so we could do it for the work, and sometimes they did.
We were amazing that there was so early an early talent talent.
But instead of wonder why they didn't look at why they just said, "God's simply since Dank you.
"Gerade," to save people to save people to save the people."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these practices. In Italy, in Italy, they were so big, in Sambia so big,
We couldn't believe it and said, "Sook, looked at the same country."
When the tomates were red, and red came acrossss about 200 nights and asked everything.
We said to the Sambian: "Oh God, the Nilpferred!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a country."
"Why didn't say that, "You're not going to ask us."
I thought we were service, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans made what the Englishers do, what the English, which was the French, I saw what they did was data, I was quite proud of our project.
We felt that found the nilporate.
They should see the uncertain -- you should see the uncertainty that we don't see the university of African people.
They should be the book "Thead Aid" from Dambisa Moyoyo, it's a sambian economic economics.
The book was published 2009.
We have changed the African continent 1,5 million euro in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has this money.
Les just take her book.
Lesen you have a African, which we have animals.
We're important people are imperialists, colonialists, and there's only two kinds of ways, like we're patriarchalic. We're patriarchalic.
Both words are coming from the latin of Latin Apater," which means "Vather"
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchal: I'm treated everyone else, when they were my kids. "I love my kids.
Patronizing: I'm treating everyone else, when they were my dying my dyermines.
So that's white people in Africa, Chef, Chef, Chef,
I was growing up when I was the book "Small I'm going to read the books of school," he said, "It's not going to be able to help people, then they don't want to go into Rwhead.
This is the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is Respect.
Today, the morning of the heart of the heart of these conference, a stabet, and asked, "Can you're going to imagine a city?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react on people, and he was a system called company, and he's never been initiated with someone who never motivated, but you will never be able to do that, but you will be the distribution of the passion, the passion of the passion, the position of the p
What you do -- you're doing -- you're going to do the mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you can see with ideas, you're set up with the sky.
We don't work from books.
We're doing in Caf<unk>s. We're doing in Caf.
We don't have infrastructure.
We finally found friends and find out what the person wants to find out what the person.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can make someone else an idea.
If these person don't like this person?
The passion for the person is the most important growth.
The passion for the own growth is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge, because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea hasn't have the knowledge, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this one: Why, why do wearing this community and people to say what they should do, why don't we hearing them? But not in community.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
We never have never been part of the time, and they'll never public, which they're going to see what they want to see what they want to see.
Planation has this blind flow.
The clearly people who knows the community of community because they never do not because they never seem to meet.
We're working to do this, to do this, to do this, to make a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new box is to be created.
This is the house of the company of the company of the bedroom, who is in your house, in your coastic and in the caf<unk> sitting your caf<unk> sitting your passion to food that the middle of life.
I have this in Itperance, West Australia, trying to try.
I promoved to the time and trying to get out of time and trying to do what they should do, what they should do.
And so I love in the first year, and I had just walked into the first year, and I had three days. I'd him. I'd him. He was a garage, he was Maori. I was a restaurant in a restaurant in Perthanism.
I half these fish fishers, and I'm not working on a wonderfish, and I don't look at a factory for 60 cents, but for 60 cents, but for Japan for 15 dollars for 15 dollars."
In a year, I had 27 percent of the government, the government, "How do you do that?
How do you. I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and hope."
So -- so -- so the government: "Make it."
We've done it in 300 community in 300 community.
We have 40,000 companies in the reasons.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go to avoid.
Peter pressure, one of the best companies of the story, starting with 96 years ago.
Peter pressure was Philosophyprofessor, before he was recovered with company. Peter D pressure said, planation is in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, and the economy."
Planation is the death of death of the entrepreneurs.
So you build Christches to know what the clocks without knowing human coastic children with their money and their energy and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these to get these together.
You have to tell them discretion and privacy, and privacy. You have to help them to help them.
In a community of 10,000 people get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and the passion?
So what presentation have the presentation of the most applaud today?
<unk>ral, empower people. They have applauded.
I want to say that companies is that company of the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial Revolution -- nichters are fossil fossil fuels, and suddenly, there's suddenly systems that are not sustainable.
The connection of the future is not sustainable.
The Freon-Aron Atron is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we have to look at seven billion people on sustainable ways, today, transporting, transporting with them, and with them.
The technologies that are not existing.
Who will revolution for the green revolution? Universities? Universities? Do you're you."
The government? Do you're going to be!
It's going to be business. And they're going to do it.
I read a future story in a future of many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were embracted to the future of the city of New York in 1860 to the city of New York.
In 1860 came together and speculated what was happened in 100 years with the city of New York City, the shelter, the city was a city: The city wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population in this tempoint in this tempoint in this tempox million pounds to be six millions of people, and it would be impossible to be impossible to be impossible to be finish.
Because they went to the mistake.
1860, they see the bad technology that lives from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 19001, there was 1001, there was 1001 Automobilher than 1001.
The idea that one other technology, had made the running, and there was little factory in the backside of little factory in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with company to work with companies.
And when he needs to be able to tell them.
And at the first time they don't talk about you.
So when you've got to tell them, you have to tell them, engaged and empathy.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the little biggest company, all of the smallest company, three things out of the sells: that needs to be able to sell the consumption, the consumption, and his financial.
Rates?
We never met a single person who can buy a little person who can buy something produce the same time and sells around the money.
That's not exists.
This person was never born.
We've wrote and we looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Fordinary, Fordinary, Yahoogle, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that allows allowed to have a successful companies, only one: No, just one person was just one person.
Now, we're going to live 16-year-old in Northumbers, and we begin to give them the first two side of Richard Bransons Autobiography Bransons Autobiography, and the first two-year-olds. The first two-year-olds.
No one "I" and 32 times.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody green a company. Nobody. Nobody.
So can we create a community, in the average that you have a little bit of Hinterground, in Caf<unk>s and Bars and Bars and Bars, and your engaged campaign for them to do what someone is going to do with you.
What can you make it? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you're going to sell you?
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Mill you think I'm going to finish?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of freedoms that can be undergrounded by the companies, and we're going to help them to help them. We have found that the wonderful population of the intelligence of the intelligence of the economic economy and the economy.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've got to be true how it must being alice in the woundland.
The Penn State University, I asked me -- a Docentin for communication -- at the communication -- in communication.
I had anxiety.
I'm going to get out of this students with their big brains and their big brains and their big books and their big books, not trusting to be the big big big books.
But when the conversation developed it, he went to me as Alice as Alice, when she looked down to a cannins and a door to a whole new world.
I felt like I felt like I was talking about the students with the students. I was just explored about the thought they had thought that other wondered that other wonderful.
I think that to open this door to open this door, it means it's great communication.
We need to change incredibly great communication of our scientists and engineers and engineering the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that our greatest problems that our greatest problems, like, energy, and if we don't know about it, and if we don't know about it, and I don't think it's not going to believe it in our responsibility as a responsibility.
But these great conversation doesn't come together when our scientists and engineers and engineers don't have a cland.
So scientists and engineers, bits, clearly clearly.
I want to show you a few answer, how you can see it, how you can see that the science and technology and technology and technology, with their technology and planet.
The first question that you have to answer is, and?
Says us why was just a scientific are so relevant for us.
Say not only that their trabells undergrounds, but also says us, that their trabeled to us that their traffic structure in our bone, because it's important structure in our bone, because it's important to understand and relationship.
And if you're going to do what you do is, then you missing father.
From after all, a hinders are a hindness of eurs.
I mean, you could use their doctors and pretty much, but why doesn't just say, "Rum and time," and time," and time, what is a lot of us?
Our thoughts, our thought is not the same as their nive same as their niveaughters.
As astein is already said, "Make the things like possible -- but not easy."
You can tell us something about your scientific own scientific areas, without knowing without compromise, without compromise.
A few things are involved to return, examples, examples and analogies. Atalogia.
And if you're doing your work, then the stories, then the stories.
Do you ever asked you ever asked why it's "Stich Punct."
What happens when someone is that someone else? One, and one of them, and with these points, and with these points.
A following this is not just long, but it's not just slowly too much on the language of our brains and though we're going to be fast.
These example of geneview brown is much we're much more effective. It shows that the special structure of the trabele of trabeled to the inspiration for the inspiration for the inspiration for the single design.
The trick here is, a single thing, just a single sentence, which is the audience, when it's audience, orients can be losing the fax and pictures that can also be used to make our other senses and graphics that are a terrible and terms of distance of distance of distance
These are just a few answer that can help us to help us to see these door and the wonderlands that science and the technology and the technology and technology.
And the engineers I've been undergrounded by the way, I've been able to make me in me," I want to make all with a same with a same with a same thing.
So, in fact, the science of education and education, and your fields, so that's going to tell the audience, which is important, and multiplicated the gender of the people who are incredible for their own work, and it's incredible working. And it's incredible.
So scientists and engineers, if you have these same same thing, clarify me, it's not incredibly uncomfortable.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my handy.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
With a handy can be a cell phone in Syria in Syria.
With a handy can tweet a message and a protestail in Egyption in <unk>gype of Egypt.
And with a handy can take a song, you can take a song-cloud and box and box.
All that's possible.
I've been in 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the city in this city.
There's a hundreds of thousands of people for changes on the streets and the constrated.
We're in the heart of 1989, and we asked us to change all these people who had changed on the tasks, a handy in the task.
Who in Saal has a handy there?
Hald it.
Hald your handy phones, you're high.
Hald it. Aroid, a slackberry, a blackberry, wow.
These are many. Fast everybody has a handy.
But today, and my handy, and my handy, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about following.
These are 35.830 cells of information.
Rohdates.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer 2006, the E.U.Kommission is a reline.
This is called Rightlinie is called Rightlines,
This direction is that every telephone is that every telephone in Europe, every Internetdia, every Internet service in the entire Europe, a bandbread of bandbread.
Who do you get a look at? Who's a email?
Who shark a sentence?
And if you use a handy, where you're using.
All of these information are going to be six months to two years of your telephone from your telephone or your Internetanby or your Internetanby.
And everywhere in Europe, people are in Europe, and said, "That's not going to."
They said, we want to tell these ideas, we don't want to do this idea.
We want to be self-bestimate self-dime, and we don't want to be the telephone and Internet services and Internet services.
There was appliate, Journalists, Prister, who said, "This is not going to."
And here you can see how 10 thousands of people on the streets of Berlin streets and said, "Freeity."
And some people said, this maybe even thought that could be 2.0.
The stasi was the secrets in Ostdeed in Ostdeed.
And I asked me to ask if that really works.
Can you really know all of these information about us?
Every time I use my handy?
So I asked my phone, I asked my phone who was the decom that was the greatest telephone in Deutching telephone, and I asked her, and I asked them all of me, and I asked me all of you.
And I asked her, she asked her and she wondered, and I didn't get a right answer.
But then I said, I want to have these information because it's my life is protocolated.
So I decided to do a general experience, they wanted to have a sense because I wanted to have these information.
But the carry telecom said, no, no, we will not give you this information.
At the end of the end of a comparison with them.
I'll turn back to the ancients where they all sended me all of the information.
Because in the second time, the basically decided that the involution of E.U.
So I'm going to have this half of environment with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35830 cells information.
First, I saw it, and I said, good, it's half a huge datei. Myetwee.
But then I realized a while: That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this datei.
So I was a little bit of skeptical, what should I start with it?
Because you see where I'm going to see where I'm going to do what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information with these information.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people what is the preventing prediction.
So with time oil oil and open Data City, so I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can reinceooms and racooms, you can pull back and back.
You can do every step, I do, I do, after all.
And you can see how I can see from Frankfurt with the full of Frank, and how many antrips.
All of that is possible to this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about us.
First of all, I'm just asking my wife, and we talked about me, and we talk about each other.
And then I called a few friends and they call them a few friends.
And a while you run a while you and you call this giant communicationnetwork.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, they're going to go to the time they go to Bettle, and then they go to Bettle.
You can see all of it.
You know, you know, the central figures, about who are the leaders of the group.
If you can see access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to these information, you can control the society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect developed developing a society about how to do a society because you know who's a email, who's possible, everything that's possible when you have access to these information.
And these information are going to be information for months, in Europe to 2 years.
How I said to say, we asked that all of these people in the streets in the streets in 1989 Handys in 1989 Handys in her pockets.
And the stasi, who would have been wonstration of the demonstration of the visited, and if the stasize that the leaders are never happened.
The case of the Berliner Mauerliner may not states.
And also not the case of the case of the ice.
Because today is stategents and companies like many information, like many information, how they can get about us, online and often online and often.
They want to be able to success our lives, and they want to follow the popularly long.
But even self-bestimation and a life in the digital time, not a video.
But everybody needs to be able to help you today.
They have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you say, you say, Privacy is a value of 21st century is a value of 21st century.
If you go home, say, you say your attractive, just because companies have the companies and state the possibility, they have to do it, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't think about your phone, you ask your phone society, you've talked about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your handy, if you remember your handy, you remember the self-bestimation in the dark.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spirituosens, snellrestaurants, brestaurants.
So the city planets, and so the name South Central South Central to change it, so he's changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that was something that's something that's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spirituoes, snellrestaurants, brestaurants.
So like 26,5 million other Americans live in the food South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-thrus and the Drive-by-bys.
The comic is that the Drive-thrus more people killed than the Drive bys.
People sentence in South Central Los Angeles.
The fatherity is in my father's carrying. B. Five males, five times as about 15 kilometers, which is about 15 miles.
I couldn't go to the more withans.
And I asked me how you feel like you would feel like you'd have a curious food if you had no curious food when you're looking out of the house that negative effects that the best expectations that has been on your food system.
I'm going to buy role stage and sells how buying buying and selling as building.
I see Dialysecenters, like Starbucks like Starbucks.
And I started to stop that this is what I need to listen to.
I captured that the problem is the solution.
It's the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no lossible, I didn't have a luster to get a pesticians to get a pesticians who don't have to get a pestician.
So I plant, I plant a food waldom of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call Parkanlage.
It's 45,000 feeters.
The thing is the thing that it's the city of the city.
But you have to pay it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I have to hold it."
And I decided to hold it into standard.
So I came and my groups that L.A. Green ground, and we started together, and we started together, and observation, and observation, so the whole program, so the whole program, so the whole program,
We're a kind of imagination, and we're made out of genaries from all social signs and all of these social signs, it's completely free, and everything we're doing, and everything we do, is cost.
And the garden is wonderful.
But then someone else.
The city came to me and he took me and he told me, and he said that I had told my garden, and said that I need to be a richness.
And I thought, "Come is, right?
A richters of foods areas of foods of foods on a piece of country, that's trying to be a great dead?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her so. Her so that."
Because this time wouldn't go.
The LA. Times window of it. Steve Lopezzz, and talked a story about it, and talked to the city of Green Breen Green Green Green Green Green Bang.org and 900 different difference.
We'd gave you in the hands.
My city rather than even strates and said they're support and love what we do.
So why would they do that?
LA.A. has in the United States most bridge in the best states in the city of the city.
They're best 67 miles.
These are 20 central Parks.
This is enough flying to plants to plants to plants.
Why is not the task, they shouldn't find it?
And by the approach of a plant, you're 1,000 sames.
With green Bohan in the value of a dollars, you're own and community in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my heilsbothood, I say they should be able to build their own food.
His eating food is how his own money is how his own money.
Look, I have a conversation in South Central.
I grew up there. I've got my sons.
And I'm surely part of this, part of this is a reality that was made by other people who were fabricians and I fabricians.
Look, I'm a artist.
Garden is my graffiti. I plants my art.
As a graffiti-courn artists, the walls, I change Rasen and Parkanlagen and Parkanlagen and Parkanlagen.
I use the gardens that the Earth, like a piece of piece, and the plants are my dreams for these hopes.
They would be surprised what the Earth, if you can use it as a legs as a country.
You can't imagine how it's a sunlume is a sunlume is, and how they're leaders.
So what happened?
I've been experienced to a instrument for the instrument and the construment of my fourth.
To change the community, you have to change the collaboration of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wonderful how kids are going to be influenced.
Garners is the therapistic and coastic and coast, especially with the city.
You know, you're going to get the experience.
I remember this time when these mother and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30s, and I came out in my garden, and I came out.
I'm surely bad, because they were feeling there, and I said, "Wisst you have to do that.
The garden is not without reason on the street."
I've been walking when I saw people looked like this, and I was so close to me, and that's what I was like, "Fin, people asked me, "Fin, you don't have anxiety."
And I said, "Thy teaching, no, no anxiety that they don't know what they're smart.
It's because it's not on the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but I want to take it back, but I want to take their health."
At the other time I lived a garden in this obdession in Downtown LA.
These are the guy who are helped me to decided to decided.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it is impacting how they've been able to see with her mother and her grandmother and her grandmother, and it was great, and it was great for a moment.
Green reason has been planted about 20 garden.
Let's go to our environment, and they did so 50 people and they're all free-free volunteers.
If kids carbon, it eat children.
When they turn tomates, they eat domata.
But if they don't get anything about it when they don't get together when they don't get the food and body eating it, they eat, they eat.
I see people who want to work, but they want to work, but they're in this thing -- I see -- I see in this thing -- I see on the path, who are exactly on the path, and that's what they're going to be in front of them.
The Garden I see when I see a opportunity where we train these kids can train themselves to care their communities to lead after life.
And if we do that, who knows who knows?
We could bring the next few George Washington Carvernment.
But if we don't change the collaboration of the Earth, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want.
I want to share a whole cock in Garden plants where people can share the food in the same blocks.
I want to take shipscontainer and they're using in health caf<unk>s.
So, don't understand me.
I'm not talking about costs, because I don't know, because cost.
The comics of sustainability is that you have to behavior.
I'm talking about people, people working to hold people, and children from the streets, and they're going to record the stolt and the eating the eating and if you look at your own food, and if you can open the buildings.
So what I want to do here is to do here is sexy.
I want to say that we all have ecological rebell, Gangster, Gangster,
We need to take the picture of Gangsters.
If you don't have a gangster.
Ganger will you with '5 selling, right?
And let's just read the waffected.
If you want to make meeting, you don't want to make me when you're in a couple of stage and a meeting and a meeting, where you want to talk about where you talk about it.
If you want to make meet you, you're going to take your garden, so we can do any sort of small snow.
Free. Thank you.
Thank you.
Oxford English words in the entire Oxford English words, "snollygoster."
Because it's so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "No,"
Although in 19th century, a newspaper of a time, a better definition, "It's a better definition, someone who is an astributed, unprecomfortable, program or line, program or line, programming the power of power.
I don't have a idea what "spracheral."
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politicians, and all politicians have to control the language.
For example, for example, for example, the British Parlament, time not the British Parlament,
And that was actually back to the mutes of a man's countered with the extraordinary names Brass Crosby, who was sure with the Parlament.
She was helped him in the Tower of London and he was a muthor, but he was muty enough, he was muthorities, and he was so much unfortunately that he was so much uncomfortable.
And just a few years later, we find the first news, we find the first news for the first night, like Brass."
Brassrooms on the English word for Blech.
But that's not true. It's not going back to a relationship.
But to show you how words and politics are launched, I want to take you to the United States, as they were just going to be able to do the unability.
You saw the question of how to ask the question of Washington, the state of Washington,
You didn't know.
How do you call the leadership of a republican nation?
And that's been debate in Congress,
And there were all kinds of possible proposition.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Gouvernur Washington, and others, and others, and others, and others, and others of the United States of America Washington.
Not so that's not a present.
Some people wanted to call him a nice.
They thought that was during.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king time.
It would have function.
But everybody was uncomfortable because these debate three weeks, because these debate 3 weeks.
I've been able to do this day of a senators who are strong, "Immer even the same is the same subject.
The reason for the connection and the long time was that the representation was that the representation.
The representation was not going to do that what's going to do is not going to do. They didn't want to do it.
Can you call it, and it would be possible to be able to bring it up to the ideas.
They wanted to the most powerful, the most painful title, the most paintings that they give them a game.
This title was "President."
President. They didn't existed the title. He existed. But he didn't exist. But he did somebody else.
It's something like the prediction of a Jury.
He didn't have the size of the recording "Apasser" or "Apasser."
Sometimes, there were president little colonial community and governments and government, but it was really an incredible title.
So that's why the senat him.
They said, "That's long, you can't call it President.
This cerles has to be different covered and explored citizens and citizens.
Who will take it, if he's going to take a dumb small title like President of America?"
And also after 3 weeks ago, not after three weeks.
Instead of the course of the title of the title of the title of the course of the color, but they didn't want to use it to be away from their own respects, and they didn't know how to civilization and methods.
You can learn from three interesting things.
First -- and I think, I've been able to find out -- until now, if the senatisfy the senatisfy.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just been able to just satisfy.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something that's something temporary -- then you've been 223 years later.
Thirds, and that's really important point, that's the most important point, the title "President of America" of America" is not so the clean states, right?
This has something more than 5,000 nuclears of doing something that he's got and the largest volcancial economy of the world and a photte drones and this whole stuff.
And I think we have given the title size of the size of the size.
And so the senat at the end of the end.
They have a respectables of title.
And the other sensors of the sense of the sense of illness -- now it was so.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they want to all sound like the classes with the 5,000 nuclear boundaries, and so on.
So at the end of the senat and the representance, because no one has lost anybody because no one is going to feel like a whole time you feel like a whole president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take with, and I'm going to take me.
Politicians trying to use the reality to create the reality and reality to control the reality, but actually changed the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a laster with about 50 rebelled 50 rebelled approach to Diabadian surface, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I thousands of my black converse Halby country, a pair of lederandal and covered a rocket in direction of governments that I couldn't see any time I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
And I was slowly, I was written with the war, all of the warning new pyjama Partys and football playing with the samstair and footprints with ristic southern Southern Cindncilian southerness and religionalistration.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm going to stand here, citizenshane, Southeast Afghane, atheist and a radical grade of God, and a radical artists, the last nine years in Afghanistan, and covered the last nine years.
So there's a lot of things that we can do is to make a lot of things about the art, but I couldn't make a regenerate arts, I want to make arts that are personality and cars that are personality and cars and cars and cars and recovery.
I want to spend a day in life of a distance -- Gangsters who spend his distance, like <unk>Popstar Bling Communists like <unk>Popstar Bling and political corruption and political corruption and political corruptions.
And what's suns can do is doing the Dihad-Gangster than the Parlament and a choice with the Slogan: "Would I do this slogan: "Whad and I'm talking to you."
And try to use these campaign to use these mafiosiosiosiosiosiosiosize the nationalhels.
I want to take the corruption in Afghanistan, and I'm going to take a project called "Ruth" and called "Ruthorizists," which you're going to take a wrong controls the streets of cars and cars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan of my mind, my mind, and I became the "modical conflict.
The war and the war and the free-free-drived answer that have a new environment for style and models that you can only build a model of source that you can only a model for soldiers and self-moothers, and self-moothers, I've been able to celling a celling a
And I would like to see how a simple shoots from Kabular cabul between cabulating appell of 18999, and that the idealogue that the development of the world today, and they're going to create their woods.
But for all of these things can come into the prison, they can be missed, they can be missed.
But I do it because I have to do because I have to lost the geography of self.
This is my favorite. Which is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and since a time I worked as a model.
Second 10 years, right?
I have the sense that now is now in the room, I've been built on the room, because I wouldn't have to start to start this cleidider.
Fortunately, I've got something to do something like this.
This is the first time that someone is that someone on TED book on TED books, so you can see, so happy to see.
If there was a few women really explored when I got out when I got to tell me that I don't need to say that later.
I also think I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very shortly 10 seconds, because I can think about 10 seconds.
And that doesn't have any chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to train them.
The most difficult thing is to pullover about my head, because then you'll be able to pull out of my head, so long as heads, so long as head.
In order to do it.
Why did I do that?
That was personal.
Now, it wasn't hopefully like this picture.
One is powerful, but a powerful, but a surface.
I just went to my opinion of me in 6 seconds of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been in reality.
I felt very uncomfortable and photographed me, I was so all my back in my hands and with my hand in the hair in the hair in the hair.
And then, from operations or the wrong bridge I'm going to target two days ago, there are only very few opportunities, there's only very few options of our questions -- although it's unconscious and our lives -- although it's a big impactable.
Through to be hot to be honest for me to be honest.
And I'm standing on this stage because I am a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a hill, white woman, and in my branches, and in my branch.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always asked me, but on the real way.
The first question is, "How will you a model?"
I'm always say, "Oh," but that means, but that means nothing.
The real reason why I was a model, is a violence in genetic lottery and maybe you're asking this experience and maybe what this experience.
Now, in the last few centuries, we didn't just beauty and young and young and young, and we're not only defined by the conservation, but also, as biological programmed, but also hospital.
This is a result for me. And it's a same thing for me.
I know there are people in the audience that are people in the audience, and maybe some models, and maybe some models: "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liui Wen."
And I'm going to comments, I'm going to be inside your model.
But I'm sorry, I have told you that in 2007, a very at the year 2007, a very exposed to the nYU all the models on the single, every single one, and that was booked by seven or two seven percent of them were only two percent or less than two percent of the produced by the process.
The next question that I always been said, "Can I'm going to be a model, if I'm grow up?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know what I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer that I want to give these little girls, "Why?
You know what? You can be? You can be all be.
You can be presidentinent in the United States or the invention of the next Internet, or a Ninja Herzirurg Dichin, which is greatest, because then you would be irregent."
If they say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Cameron, I want to say, "Who," I say, "Whode my cameron."
Because I don't have responsibility for nothing and you could be the corner of American vogue or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next sea Meisel.
To say that you're going to be a model, is that you want to say that sometimes you want to say that sometimes you want to win the Jackpotto.
You can't be able to impact and it's not a career.
Now, I want to tell you 10 years ago, I want to know about 10 years, because other than heart, because other than heart, because it can only be just fold.
If you're going to be a photograph, and that's exactly how a nice, and the customers, and the customers, and the cameron, and then you want to go to the legs, and then you go to the legs, and this poor, and this poor, this poor, and this poor, this poor, and this poor, this po
It looks like this.
Hopefully comic than that in the middle of the middle.
That was ... I don't know what happens.
If you look at school and a life, and a life has made a few jobs, you can't be much more saying that you can't say that you're going to say that you want to be a lot of the United States, but in life, "10 years."
The next question that I'm talking about, "Who's all photos?
And yes, so pretty much every photos will be retuse, but that's just a little part of the story.
This is the most picture I did, and that was made, and that was also the most of all the first time I was trying to drug. I hadn't even my piode.
I know that's pretty personally personally, but I was a young girl.
So I saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is what I'm on the day.
My friends had to start me.
This is I'm on a Pyjama Party, a few days ago, a few days ago.
This is what I'm with the football team and in the v-Magazine.
And that's what I'm going today.
And I hope you see that these images are not images of me.
It's constructs and it's constructs of a group of profis, from Hairstylists and Make-up coast and photographers and photographs and photographs and the nonproduction. It's not the production.
Okay, askay, when people ask me, "Cree, you know, "Cree things?"
Yes, I have too many 20-cm-Abship that I never met, but the things I can never be able to get things that I'm going to get things that I'm going to talk about it, and we don't like to talk about it.
I'm in Cambridge and a day, and one day I went to a laden and I had my money, and you gave me the cambridge for the clothes.
When I went to my friends with my friends, a free-free driver, and they were talking about a red launch of course, and of course, we needed to have a redote, "If you have a power," and we could further.
I have these costs of my cost things, and I don't get my personality and not because of my personality and there are people who are personality and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were in the last year, and we filmed in the last year, 85 percent sister.
It live in New York only 17,000 young, men, men, and Latinos, for the question, "Who I'm going to ask you to go to the question?"
So, "How often I'm going to look at? When I'm going to look at?
And I found my rights for these talks for these talks about 53 percent of all 13 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, and these numbers are not going to be 17 percent when they're 17 percent when they're 17 percent when they're 17 percent.
The last question is, "How is it, how is it, how is it, a model?"
And I think they expect them, they expect this answer: "If you're a little bit of harm, and you feel like you're very happy and fabulous and fabulous and fabulous.
And Backstage, we give answer that maybe this eindructure.
We say, "It's really great, so much to record, and it's greative, inspired, living inspired people."
Everything that's true, but it's just a half of the story, because what we never before the camera, which I never said, "I feel like I've never felt."
And I feel like to think about myself because I have to think every day about my exception.
And if you ask yourself, "What would I be happy if I had thinner legs and global legs and global legs?"
Then you should make a few models, because they have the most thinest legs and the most global legs and the coolest coolest coolest coolest coolest women and they're the mostly on the planet.
When I was noticed this talk, he was very difficult to me very difficult to tell me, a real bit of a real bit, because one of them, I felt very uncomfortable, and say, "I got all the benefits, and say, "I got all the benefits." And I was going to believe it." And I was going to belie
It was very difficult to be very difficult, a result of unfortunately and repressed by the biggest nutrients, if I'm one of the biggest nutrient.
But I'm also happy and I'm going to be here, and I'm going to be great, and I think it's great, I've been here before 10 or 20 or 30 years before 10 or 20 or 30 years, and my career, because I wouldn't know how to do I'd like told me.
If you take something with this talk, then you're allowed to take all the power of the imagination of the imagination and mistakes more successful exploration.
Thank you.
I've never forget the words of my grandmother, which is never forget about life, "Son, list of Gaddafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Widdafi Wid Wid Wid Worte.
But who never would never be something like a gaddafi-Revolutionary."
It's almost two years, since the liby school revolution from the libycle of the waves of the waves of the waves of the mass of the oldests as well as in the Egyptical revolution.
I spent myself with many other libyers, inside and extraordinary, and extraordinary, to start a day of the tyrannian revolution to start the tyrannic revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Now, June, liby women and men were stood in the first range, for the first range of the regimes, holding slogans of the freedom, and social generality.
They've been example, they've been able to eating themselves by the brutal dictature Gaddafis.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the most far from the east, until the west, until the south.
Finally, after a time-shaps of six months and almost 50,000 toted to start our country and the tyranians and the tyranians and the tyranians.
But Gaddafi, every big big boring a big bit of the tyrannei, who corruption and the reason for corruption and the reason for cours.
Four decades had gaddafis Tyrannic Regime, the infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The consciousness and the challenge, I realized how many other women, I as many other women who are civil society, and we're reporting approach to Democracy and national extracy and national extracy.
So took 200 organizations were during and about 200 organizations in Benghazi, almost 300 in Benghazi.
After 33 years in Exil, I got back to Lybia, and with a single Enthusiasm, I started Workshopshopshopshopshopshopshops and leaderships.
With one wonderful group of women, I women who I women, and I women, a movement of women, a movement of women, leaderships, and it's opening the goalthy of the public healthy.
I met the payer I met on a very difficult environment, a survey, a survey, a polarized politics. A environment of Dominancial and explained by Dominancial and explained.
I lived a contributed to the peace of peace and women who are women to make a liby choice and paying a law, a law, a law, each citizens, and they should be able to give you appear to be able to country and pold and politize the right now.
In the end of our initiative, and successful.
Women women 17,5 percent of the National Congresses in the first choice for 52 years.
But longly, but the euphory of the euphories and the whole revolution to <unk>n<unk> because every day we watched to new new news of violence.
And one morning, we're looking at the money of the money and Sufi-Gralter Mosche.
One of another morning, we got news about the Mord American bothers and the angriff on the message.
And again, again, the expectations of opening the army of opening.
And really every day, we're going to see different from the milize of the milize of the miles and their own power and their power and their power and laws and laws.
Our society, against a revolutionary opportunity, polarized by the ideal and principles of the ideal and principles, social Gerek, social Gerek, social Gerek.
Intolerancial, explained and Rache was to the icones of the EFolution.
I'm not there today today today with the success story of our records of our records and the choice.
I'm going to talk today today that we have a nation that we've been done as a nation that we've done.
We've been able told our priorities.
Because the choice written written written in Lybia or security in Lybia.
Hat the rubbers of Listen and the wheels between female and men and men and national virtual virtual virtual version?
No, that doesn't.
What is it?
Why is going to continue our society and dominated by self-shinancial politics of the dominance and the explancial, and the explances, how do you know?
Maybe the women didn't have the only thing that has female, but the female women's female of the compassion and the university.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensumption, as they brought the choice, which has the polarization and decision and decision and decision and decision.
Our society needs the qualitative construction of the female of the female, quantitative construction of the female.
We need to listen to the name of the corns and a day of the roach of the roach of the roach.
We need to start to start to create the compassion and the gnade.
We need to develop a female discovered that the following waiting waiting, but also to use: Gnade, and instead of collaborators, approach, approach, approach, approach.
These are the ideal that is a visited by war, and it takes lybia to make peace.
Because the peace has a alchemy and in this alchemics, and it's about the femines and masculines.
This is the real record.
And we need to exist, we need to do it before we do it sociopolitical.
After a message from the Koran "Salam" -- Fried "istmaster God,"
The word "rawing" again, all of the abrahamic tradition, and that's what the same Arabic wonderful as the word "rahemics," and symbolized the mother, and the whole femins that the whole personality to the humanity and the humanity of humanity and the humanity,
And just like the mother's exactly the embryo that in himself in himself, completely the reason of compassion.
So this is why he said, "My Gnade Gnade all things."
So this is why he said, "My Gnade has been a prepared."
Maybe all of us all the guns of the gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country was the best of the world, and I went to bring "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we're going to see the story of clim Il-Sung, but we learned not very much about the world, except that America, South Korea and Japan our femies are.
Although I was often asked me how the outside of my life, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until away from all the time.
And so I saw years, I saw a public head, but I thought, I thought, my life in North Korea,
My family wasn't poor, and I had to live with myself.
But in 1995, my mother had a letter a letter of war, from the Swester a collegin.
Darin stands: "If you're going to be here, our five family, because we've been for two weeks, because we've been for two weeks.
We love together and our bodies are so bodies and our bodies are soon as well.
I was so shocked.
I heard about the first time, I heard that people in my country.
I went to the bahnof, and I saw something small, and I saw something that I can't get more from my memory.
A live woman lay on the ground, and approached a kid in their army, and approached in their face.
But no one was half them because all of them, because all of them were so that they were sured to care about themselves and their families.
In 1990s, there was a big hunger in North Korea.
At the end of North Korean, who was fallenging the open, and many more than they're far more about, and many other people, because they're based on the side.
In the middle of the challenge, so that's been so that it's going to be done, excepted by China on the other side of China on the other side of the environment that we're going to where we've where we've been.
I always asked me why she was there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors.
This is the Fluss Amrocast <unk>, who is the border between North Korea and China and China.
As you can see, the flow of flows, and it's very simple north Koreaners who are the flights.
But many sentence.
Sometimes I saw people in the flower.
I can't say much about how I can left North Korea, but I can say that I can say that I was during the hunger of the hunger of the hunger.
I thought I was a short time of my family of my family.
I would never thought that it was 14 years to take it back together.
In China was very hard to live as young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be as northcoreanic flying, but I would be able to be extremely extremely difficult, but I don't just extremely difficult, but also, because of I'm not just as illegal.
So I lived in strong, I could fly including my reality, and you would be able to fly in a bit of Sendalf after North Korea.
One day, my biggest alptraum, when I was found from Chinese police, and in the police and in the police, and in the police.
Somebody else me, North Korean, so they did my Chinese scientists and they asked me to tell me about my chinese questions.
I had solidly, I thought, I thought, I would exploding.
Well, for anything else, I could be experience, I could be egggged and absolutely.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I did it, but I'm survived my feelings and answered the questions.
After they were finished with the example, said, "This was a false.
It's not North Korean."
And they love me. It was a wonder.
Some North Korean, in China in China in China in China, but many of the Chinese police and a lot of Chinese police and absolutely.
These girls had lucky.
Although they were expecting, they were free, they were free international pressure international pressure international pressure.
This North Koreanerins didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, until we're going to be in China, and after North Korea, where they're going to be followed or published or published or public.
Although I had been lucky, I had lucky, it's not so much other north Koreaners.
It's tragic that North Korean, their identity and hard to survival.
After they learned a new language and worked on a moment, can be found their world in a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the hidden of the concerned about seeds, and I started to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
Mich in South Korea, was a larger challenge, a larger challenge, when I thought it was thought.
English was so important that I had to start to learn how to learn to learn.
And I've been talking about the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all corean, but inside, we've been very expanded by 67 years of 67 years of participation.
I fly through a identity.
Bin I'm South Korean?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Plike, there was no lander, that my home, my home.
Although I was the anpassion of the south Korean life, I had a plan.
I'm asked to the attention of the university of university.
I was asked to my new life, I was going to be able to get a bad called a bad called an eye.
The North Korean Behold, the money I family, and when I was sent to my family between my family between my family between place on the country.
They had to fast as possible, so I started to plan.
North Korean, you have to go back to the incredible streets on their way.
It's almost impossible to convinced North Korea and South Korea, Ironically to China and I was took a plane and made me back to China and I was on the north Korean Grence.
Because my family didn't have to live them, I had to live them on more than 2,000 miles through China and then after Southostasia.
The bush is a week, and we've been almost almost almost almost almost.
Once when the bus on the bus on the bus, a Chinese police,
He took the except of all the except of all the ways.
And I didn't understood, I thought I thought she would be followed.
When the Chinese example, my family, I decided told him, and she said that she was going to believe it, and I was going to be since.
He looked at me, he looked at me, but happy, he was happy.
We've got it to read it to the laotic border, but I had took almost all my money to bring the border of Laos.
But even after we had the border of the border, my family inhaft, I illegal garrency.
After I had money and shooting money, my family, my family inside of a month, but course, my family was repeated in the mainstad of Laos.
This was one of the biggest running of my life.
I had done everything to help my family to freedom, and we were so close took it, but my family was just family, just my family.
I went back and I went to the involved and the police and the policeistation, and try to family, but I didn't have enough money or money or money or money or money or money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And so I asked me the voice of a man, "What's los?"
I was completely surprised that a friendly surprised.
In broken English and with a wordship and I was explained my situation and without a bankomat, and he went to a bankomat, and two other north core, and two other northern North Korean, and two other northern North Korean.
I thanked him from all the heart and asked him, "Why help me?"
"I don't help you," he was.
"I help the north Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The before theory of Frembolized frembolized for me to a new hope that the North Koreanerany, and he showed me the friends and he showed me the friends and the university of the community of the community as the Northern Germany.
Finally, after our long journey, my family, and I remained family, but the freedom.
Many North Korean, they're done by their families and soon as they're in a new country, they're not going to start with little money or not a money.
The international community can help us help us in education, the English, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of us, because many of us have still in contact with families, and we're sending them information and generation and generate the money, North Korea.
I had a happiness, so much helping and inspiration inspiration in my life, I hopeful North Korean American northcorean corean successful.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful North Korean, also see on the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a bit of a bit.
I don't say that I'm not normal.
So I want to imagine my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't talk about, but he can't communicated free, like some of the best reds.
Remi white is what love is.
He's participate it, and he expensive it uncomfortable.
He's not just a real thing. He doesn't look at the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences and imagine, and imagine, he's never tell you a light.
If he singings from our childhood, it's trying to remember the words, I remember one thing: how little we know about the understanding of how little we know about the unknown and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16th. He's very good. He's very good.
He's absolutely uncomfortable memory.
But he also has a selective.
He can't remember if he remember my shocolate, but he remember the public, but he remembers of every long on my iPod, conversation that we had been four, as four, as he was fouring on my phone.
Do they don't know incredibly?
But many people don't stimate.
And in fact, because their understanding of the society of normal pased by normal past, they're often wrong.
But what my heart was the heart and my soul, and my soul, though this was the case was that the case was not as a similar to be able to look at it, that it was just a good thing: that they were extraordinary -- extraordinary and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who don't use the people who don't trust the terms of the brain, it's a complex function of the brain, which is social complex function of the brain and sometimes the social skills and sometimes.
It's like every individual in every individual, it's roemiating as a sam.
And the world is going to be all 20 minutes in a new person Autism, and although there's one of the most fastest growth, there's one of the world, there's no known association.
And I can't remember the first time I remember when I remember autism, but I can't remember it.
I was born three years old when my brother was born, and I was so on, and I was so on, and I was so on my life.
And after a few months, he was different.
He wrote a lot.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, and in fact, he didn't really interested in me.
Remi, and regulated in his own world, with his own rules, and he found out of your own rules, like a cars, like autos in a series in a series of what machine cars, and allowing it to eather and everything it.
And when he was older, he was different and the differences were significant.
But then the woods and the funny and the frustrial hyperactivity was something really a really unique: a very unique, a junny nature, a boy that had never been a junky, a human, who had never been a human, who had never been.
Onception.
Now, I can't live that there was some of the moments in my family moments in my family, moments I wished that they were exactly how I would be exactly how I would be exactly how I would be exactly how I would be.
But I'm going to go back to the thoughts that they've learned me to have individuality, communication and love, communication and love that these things I wouldn't want to thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of things
Normality about beauty that beauty that beauty that we're going to give us, and the fact that we're different, that is not that one of us is that one of us.
It means that there's another kind of responsible.
And if I just want to say a thing to say and say to Sam and then you wouldn't be normal.
You know, you know, you're extraordinary.
Because, Autistic or not, the differences that we have -- we have a story! Everybody from us, and in all of us, and in all the streets of our own lives, that's the ultimate open-foresty.
The chance on size, the progress and Wallel stirt in the moment that we try to be trying to be different.
Please -- you're not saying I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edggerton has a leader and neuriosity, and neuriosity, with this photo on the projectil, and with a million seconds of a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times, and see the world, and see the world, but you can't see a million or a million images per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography that photography, a new education that is so quickly the most so quickly is that they can buy time in movement in movement.
And so we can build cameras that we can build cameras that we can look at the skin or without a beautiful picture in our body, and really can actually go to our body and really in question, which we can ask with "Camera."
If I'm going to take a laser and a million-stelf-the-source, and I'm going to be more femtoseconds -- that's a packet from Pakethotones, and this is a millimeter, and this is going to be a message, and this project.
So if you take this projectil, this photones, and it's going to take it into these flashes, how will be breaking these photones in the flashion?
How does it look like light in time?
So this whole events --
So think about it, the whole events are actually less than a nanosecond less than a nanoseconds -- so light, so light to get this stream, but I'm light, but I'm lighting this video to see the factor 10 billion.
Noca-Cola Coca-Cola hasn't financial.
So in this movie happens very much, so let me show you what happens to show you what happens.
The Puls, our projectile, our project, driving a photones with a photonpaket, and that's starts to move and that's always inside.
A part of the light, after outside the table, and you see these expensive.
Many of the photones are reaching the past last last potential of the flash and exploding in different directions.
As you can see, there's air, air, which is airles that are in the flash.
While the waves are ready to the waves on the table and because of the reflexions of the reflexions of the flexions of the focuss on the end of the focuss.
If you take a piece of project, and it's the same street and the video back to the video back 10 billion, and the video, you know how long you have to see how long you have to see here?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very long movie -- from a long movie -- from a long-term project.
And how does it look like a little bit of still botography?
You can see how these waves the table, the table, the table and the wall in the background.
It's like when you put a sentence in a teach.
I'm going to make it as if the nature as a photo males, the nature, the movie, but of course, of course, but of course, our eye.
But if you look at this tomate, you will see that if you'll see that if the lights the lights, that if the lights, you're going to be done. They're not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the tomate is reified and the light in their light and a few million seconds.
So in the future when these femto-Kamera in your camera in your camerahandy, it might be able to be able to make a supermarket, and you can see if a fear, if you're going to be able to build a fear without.
So how did my team at MIT this camera?
So as photographs know if you're a photo with course, you have a photo with course, but we've got a billion times a billion times as your citizens as your citizens, so you get a light.
So we're doing this: We send this projectil, this project, this photones, and show you this photones and show you this gigabynchronization and repeating this gigabytes of data to show you this female.
And we can take all of these roohdates and doing very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other hands can make us feel like if it could be able to make a new supercraft for a new superhelful surgery: to see ecks?
The idea is that we're going to stand up on the door.
It's going to go back into the room, a part of it, part of it will reflect and reflecting back to the door and we could reflect these more simples of light.
And that's not a science fiction. We've built it even built.
Link of our femto-Kamera.
Hinter the wall is a puppeared and we'll be able to let the door.
After our attention in the Nature Communication, and it was published by nature.communication.com.com.coming them.coming these animation.
We'll be able to fight and they'll be able to help them and they'll be able to help and this photones will be in all directions and some of the photones will be able to reach our light, and then we'll be able to let the light and then repeat the trees.
And because we have a camera that's so quickly -- our femto-Kamera has some single camera.
It has a very good time, and she can look at the world in light, and it can look at the world.
And then we know, of course, we know, but also the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point of the point.
So what we can see is that we can see a rooh-by-based on the screen, and how they see on the screen -- not really, but if we're going to take many of these images, and then we're going to try and try together and try together and try together.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit of doing this, before we can see the practice, and we can build the collisions, and we can build the collisions that can be able to see what's going to do with the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the lights.
But because of the blood and the tissue is very, of course, that's why this really is a way to think about scientists, so that's why a new photography photography, because a new picture of medical education of medical education of medical education.
So, like, and we can do this, and we can do a scientist, and we can have a scientist, and we can have a art of the ultra-constraphy, and I realized that all of these gigabytes that all of these gigabytes we know every time we don't know every time.
But it's happening here, something lust.
If you look at these waves under the rivers of the rivers, you see that the waves of us.
The waves should be moving to us.
What happens here?
It turned out that we're almost in light because we've almost in light, and incredible effects and astein's incredibly walked this image.
The regularly, in the events in the world, in the world, he seems in the world, so that you can see the camera in the camera, so by space and time you can see the space and time we can create these conservation.
So, if we should be able to show you whether we should be able to build the exploration of a new data, or new data, and new data, we've allowed us to do all of our food and datails, and we've been able to do with our weapons and data.
It's about time. Thank you. Thank you.
There are many ways of our opportunities, how our lives can improve our lives.
We don't meet every night in the street, so many ways of wisdoms don't use this same public places.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and share things like a call called things like a job, shablones and circlones.
The projects from my questions, how much matter how much matters?
How can we listen to more things without us, without us?
How can we share our memory of memory, and how can we understand the country?
And how can we share our hope for living houses, so our communities, our communities and dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My selected by the huge each other, the hundreds of years, the since hundreds of years, and trees, and trees line, I'm trusted to be a city where there is always a city.
I think every time, every time someone nobody, there's no one parade.
In this city is some of the most beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city with most of the city with most reason.
I'm going to be in the name of this house and I've been beautiful. There was something that I thought about something that I thought about something that has changed my life for always changed.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
You're Joan and she was like a mother for me. You know, your death.
I thought about death, and I thought, and I was a big disease for my life, and it brought me about the things that are important.
But it's hard to me, this sort of evidence every day.
It's easy to lose in the Alltaga and try to forgether.
With the help of old and new friends and new friends of the old house of the old house in a huge tafle and wrote with a shock, "Bevor, I want to be satched."
I wasn't sure what I could expect on experiment, but I was able to expect the next day, and they're going to go on.
I want to share some sentence with you, who were written by the wall.
"Bevor I want to sterve, I want to be piratter."
"Bevor I want to stervey, I want to stand over the International datums."
"Bevor I want to singinging for millions of people."
"Bevor I want to sterve a bate power."
"Bevor I want to live, I want to live "netzunability."
"Bevor I want to sterve them in my arms."
"Bevor I want to be stervey, I want someone."
"Bevor I want to be stervey, I want to be myself."
This is a laughter place was to be a sense of place, and the hope and dreams of people needed me to be the laughter and translated me while the hard time.
It's about knowing that you don't know everything.
It's about our neighbors and understanding our neighborhood and in a new way and way.
It's about being place for best for best and remembering and remember what we think about, and how we grow up, while we grow up and change us.
I made this last year, and I made hundreds of living in the last year, and I wanted to build a wallower with their community, and I wanted to build a building and now, I've been building in the world, and now, like Kasteria, like Kas, Africa, South Africa, Afric
We've been shown how much powerful public places, when we have the opportunity to share our voices and more with other people.
Two of the most valuable things that we have time and the relationships.
In a world with a world with two-down corporations, it's important than ever looking at the right blending things with the right blend and think that life is course.
We're often going to talk about death, about death, or even though, but I realized that the death, but I realized that the process of death is one of the death is one of the things that we are at most strong.
The thought about deaths of deaths us.
Our common pollines of places that shows us what we're important to us as individuals and more important. And with more opportunities, and we can't help us to share our hope to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I decided to me with me with a particular mathematics. A special problem for everyone who are considered to each other, is that we're going to be as company.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to tell you about today, to explain what I do.
Tances is one of the most human activities.
We're returned out of most of most of most of most of most of the balletts and sentence, like you see the same thing.
For Ballettles a extraordinary massive massive science and abilities, and abilities, and possible events that could have a genetic common.
Tragiled to destroy newurological stories like Parkinson, this exception of the extraordinary capacity. That's what I did was doing at my time.
And over the years, you have a lot of research in the mistake.
Despite, there's a worldwide 63 million people who live on this disease, and they have to live with the uncomfortable symptoms like symptoms like symptoms, and other people live that disease, and so that we need to do is whether we need to do is whether we need to make the poses.
We need to measure the progress of whether we can measure, and last possibility, whether we have a projective market, if we've got a projective massive massive market.
<unk>rigger is that there's no parkinson and other movement, so you can't just no biomarkers, so you can't just be a blood best in the 20 minutes.
You have to leave it in clinics. It's very expensive, and that means, and that means that never behavior. No one.
But what if patients could do that patients could do this test?
That would be a describe a hospital inside hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't be a texture of hospital.
It costs 300 percent of the neurological action in the neurological action.
So I want to tell you a unconventional methods, with the exciting we're trying to reach the senses. Because we're all, in a senses like my Because Jan Stripling.
This is a video of video of vibrate vibrate vibrate.
This is what happens in the healthy condition when someone speaks. We can look at our stimmories, because we can look at all these voices because we have to build all these voices, if we have to build all these guys, and we've allowed to do the genes.
And as Ballet is enormously enormously enormous.
Think about how long a child, like long, until it to talk about it.
And by the louds, we can use the position of vibrate vibrate vibrate, and as the game the game stimmorgane from Parkinson's done.
On the other way, you can see an example of instance, you can see an example of unrequences.
We see this same symptoms.
To true, swful, switch.
The language will be suffering and it's a symptomsymptomsymptoms.
These expectations, and that's the voice, sometimes you can be digital microphones and presential microphoney, combined with new software, combined with new laware, which is very formed with new learning with new critical laws, we can now.
How can you feel this tests with clinical mes? Well, they're not both-invasive. The Test before.
They're infrastructure. The infrastructure is there.
You don't have to build new clinics.
And they're exactly. There's nothing the voice is not experts of experts.
So you can be done by yourself.
They're very quickly, three seconds.
They're very billed and we know what that means.
If something extremely billed, you can also use it into big mass.
This is amazing slightly, we can now.
We can reduce logistic skills for patients.
Patients don't have to leave in the clinics in clinics.
We can see ifjective data through half-day data.
We can get aware of massrecy massive for clinical studies and first of clean studies, and it's a difference of the whole population.
We now have the opportunity to look for Biomarkers for the disease, before it's before it's before it.
Today, we're doing the first step in this direction, we started the parkinson's settime minsonitiative.
With Aculab and patients LikeMe Meean, we would like a very high-footing expanding enough to best enough exciting for the exciting of these slide.
We have rooms that are the divided to a billion people on this planet on this planet.
Everybody, or without Parkinson, can be recorded to get a few center for a few center to a few center. I give you a few center of our goal is six percent of our goal hours.
Thank you.
If you say, if you say 10,000 people call 10,000 people, you can say, who's healthy and who isn't it?
What are you going to do with all of these problems?
What happens is that the patient is that the patient of the callson's suffering whether this person on Parkinson's ec.
Some people will not be able to create it.
But we slightly a huge database, under different environments, which is interesting. These environments are important, because we're important to make these extracts that are the real markins are the real markins.
For the second, their 86 percent general skills?
It's much better.
My school -- I have to love him, because he's so fantastic worked because he's been working on the mobil functional works, and now it's also worked on the mobil function, and we're in 99 percent.
I call this a conservation.
This is called people -- people can do with the handy on the handy, and people can do with Parkinson's might be able to take their voice, so that their doctor of the doctor of the doctor of the disease of disease.
Goes.
Thank you. Max Long, my dadies and gentlemen!
Thank you.
Here I live in Kenya in Kenyairobi Nairobi Nairobi National Parks.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the cows is the nairobi-National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is in the southern is in the southern Everybody. It means that Wildtians like cebras the park every single time.
The raughts that the solution, the solution, and then they do this.
They kill our vieties.
This is one of our cows that were killed. I wake up. I wake up, and I found it was great. It was a great boy. It was our only bully.
My stamm that the stamm of Massai, believed that we're going together with our animals and the way we came from the sky. That's why we're so much.
I learned to kids to eat.
Our warrior warriorans. They decided our stamm and our hearts and our hearts. They're involved this problem.
and killed the solution.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobiobi.
And I think there's no idea of it in the Nairobi National Parks.
In my stamm is a boy between six and nine years ago, and nine years, and so I went to me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was Fewer. Lions for the fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us to help us to see the solution that helps us.
But I didn't go on. I didn't go.
I had a second idea. I tried to try to do it with a vogel.
I wanted to think that the solution, I thought, I was strong.
But solution are very clearly animals.
They come up, the vogels and go back again. Because the next time, but they're going to move, and they say, that's not yes, that's still here.
And they were taking and killed our fields.
One night, I watched the stall. I love with a packle in the hand to him and this time, and that's not at the country.
Lions for the light, light, that moves.
I had an idea.
Since as little boy worked on my room, I was working all day in my room and nobody took my mother and I took my mother. Another roadio, but I had a lot about electronics.
I took a old car, and I took a car, and I showed a motorrad. The left or left or left, whether you want to go down. He's blink. He's blind.
And I was a shocked me a shalter, and I'm switched a switch.
This is a little birne of a capture of a capture.
And then I built all of it.
The solar panels the battery that battery, the battery, the battery. I call it a transformation.
And the recording less blind.
You see that the birth, because the birth, because of the solution of the solution.
And this is what it looks like for the solution when they come from.
The light blinks and the solution that I think I was going to believe that I was about the case.
Thank you.
I've been so at home installed installed and since we didn't have problems with solution.
And then we heard our neighbors.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had many of their animals and she was lost their animals and she asked me if I could put their lights installed.
And I said, "Yes."
If I put the lights. They can see the solution in the background.
I've seven houses, I've been able to try and they're really good at the lights, and they work.
My idea is now used to be used in all cases, even for other raubts like Hyes or Leoparden. The Lichters, the lights of farms.
My exploration, I'm going to be a stipendium at a stip of schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International school, and I'm really excited.
My new school engaged and helps and helps through spending and recording.
I even have my friends with my friends and I've been asked together and I'm going to show the light where there are no, and I'm going to show the people how to use them.
A year I just a boy from Savanne, who was the savanne hills. I saw airplane. I saw myself, "I'm going to sit in a sitch!"
And here I'm going to stand.
I thought with a plane, I was going to start with a plane for my first TEDTalk.
I'm big, I want to be airplane and pilots are my great dream.
I've been talking solution. But through my invention, but through my father, I can save the cows and the solution, and we can live without side, and we can live without the solution.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language means that: I thank you very much.
You know, you know, it's not how long it's like your story like your story.
So you've got this stipendium. Yes. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list of the list?
My next invention, now I work on an electrical dotion. A electrical dots?
Yes, I know, electrical dune are already, but I want to found my own.
You've got it already trying to try, not trying to give you away, but I've trying to give up, but I got a shoot, because I got a shock.
All of the beginning is hard Turere, you're doing something very special.
We're going to be in every steps, and we're going to be my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm since I'm a camera in the hand, is photography, my passion. But today, but I want to share with you 15 of my favorite, and no one of them.
There was no way to do not a kind of director, no chance, no chance has been a picture. Not even the examples.
In order to be able to be most of the most people who were completely discovered tourists.
My story begins when I was a talking about a talk in New York was and my wife, and my wife on my first built on my first building on my arm. We were at the ecke of 57th and 57th and 57th.
So, we were looking back in New York and we've been decided to look at the same picture.
Now, you can see what you can see.
When the third birthday, my daughter said, "Hey, why don't you bring to New York and makes it a father to New York and makes it a father for the ritual?
And then we started to make sure days ago, we started to make a picture of us.
You know, it's notice, like universal, as universal the face is when you're talking about his camera.
Nobody has ever said, and I've never been lucky, and it's not done with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these risks would change our lives.
This is very hard to us very hard today.
This is only one weeks after the 11th, and I had to explain what happens when I had to understand what happens was happening on the day.
These images are much more than just a moment, or a particular moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a way to do for us to be a week in the october, and how we change our time and how we change our time and how we change our time, not just physical, but in all of us.
Because even though we always doing this image, changes our perspective of males. While they always see new miles, and as they're always seeing the life with their eyes, and how they see it.
These very intensive time that we spend with each other, which we've been able to expect and every year.
Last, while we're talking about one of our risks, and we're playing them how they're suddenly standing how they're showing them how they're going to be a red market, and they'd learned as little kids who love to love to love to learned.
And she told me about her feelings that she had been able told me about this sort of exactly this sort of exactly this sort of exactly.
She said she remember how to remember the heart of the breast, when she saw the first time she saw the first time,
And now she looked in New York, because they want to study because they want to study in New York.
And I realized, I realized, the most important thing we all created, memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of you, an active role in the most expective role in the most experience.
I don't know how it looks like it, but I'm looking at this 15 pictures, I'm on a family photo.
I'm always the picture.
I want to start to talk today today with you today and you're not going to ask you to ask someone, "Would you do a picture of us?"
Thank you.
