When I was in my 20s, I had my first psychotherapy patient.
I was Doctorandin and studied clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-old w
When Alex in the first sit in the first situation, she came out of the situation, and she fell in my office, she was sandals, she was sandals of her sandals and telling me, and he to talk about men to talk about men.
And when I heard that I heard that I was the same.
My commilitonin, and I got a brought a brought a brought.
And I got a woman in the 20s that wanted to talk about boys.
I was wrote that, I thought.
But I didn't get it.
With the light stories that the Alex with the sit in the sit down to the sit down to the head, just as we simply with the problems.
"30 is the new 20," Alex and I could have a little bit of the time I could have a fairly.
And worked later, he came to married, children later, children later, even the death.
People in the 20s, and I didn't have anything.
But soon as I was asked me to ask my bedroad, Alex's favorite question.
I thought about it.
I said, "Yeah, she clear, she's sleeps, they're sleeping it with a sleeping it, but it's going to married him."
And there was no one of my bed, but maybe, but maybe she's next.
And also, the best time, the best time, the best time, before they're married."
That's what psychologists called aha-Moment.
That was the moment that was not aware that 30, 30.
Yeah, people are later, people later, but it was never going to be a frontier, but that didn't do the development.
And that made Alex's 20s, and we sitting there, and we sitting there, and we sitting there.
And so I realized that this kind of hard to me, this kind of hardest problem with a serious problem with real consequences. Nich only for Alex and their favorite, but for Alex and their love, but for the career, families and families and all the 20s.
Now, there's a time, there are 50 million people in the United States in the 20s.
We're talking about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent, or 100 percent of the adults, if you don't get anyone through the 20s.
Meldet you, if you're in your 20s.
I want to see a few of you.
Oh, yeah! You're all incredible.
If you worked with someone in the 20s, a love, a love, because of a year in the 20s, I want to see you. OK.
My specialists, because I think that's because I think every single world, because I think every single 50 million works for the psychologists, neurologists, neurologists and Fridge, and the fact that the most important for the 20s and the only 20s and one of the 20s and one of the simple, and one of the
This is not my opinion. These are facts.
We know that 80 percent of the most presented moments, in the time to 350 percent of time.
That means that 8 of 10 decisions, experiences, experiences and Aha elebrators that are doing this, which is what's happening, which is what happened.
Who don't panic, if you're silence.
This group is going to go, I think it's good.
We know that the first 10 years of a profession of a board profession of how much money, how much money.
We know that with 30 more than half of the Americans, or with the Americans or with the future of partner, or a relationship.
We know that the brain is the brain and the second and last great growth and remains in the 20s, and they're going to change whatever it means that whatever you want to change your time, and now you're going to do.
We know that the personality is changing the 20s, when the 20s, and when anything else in life and that the researching the women with 28, and that the women with 285, and that's complicated things.
So in the 20s, you should go on the body and the body and the opportunities.
If we think about the development of a child, we all know that the first five years for the first five years for language and education in the brain.
It's time that's the time that has a normal life, all of life has a huge impact on the future.
But we hear about it, there's something like adults like adults like adults, and our 20s, and our 20s, and our 20s.
But that's not going to hear about 20s.
The press is talking about time, the time of the adults of the adults.
Scientists called the 20s, the 20s,
Journalists thinking about the tips for people in the 20s, "Twixters," or "Twixters" or "Cidind-Erwoods."
That's true.
And when culture, we've decision, what's going to do is now for decade for the adult.
Leonard Bernstein, I realized that big things with a plan and something to be achieved.
Isn't it?
So what happens when you get someone in the 20s, you're going to do is saying, "You get 10 years to make something like, "You know, you know,"
Nothing.
This is the human is the drawing and the drawing and it's nothing happened.
And so every day, every day intelligence, interesting people in the 20s, or how your sons and daughters and taughters and tell me something like, "I don't know, but I don't know, I don't know. I don't counts."
Or they say, "All I've been doing it with 30 years, I've been able to start my career, is all good."
But later, it's like, "My 20s, and I'm almost 20s, and I didn't have anything.
I had a better life, when I was just slowly the university."
And then it's like, "In my 20s, I was a partners, my 20s, like the journey.
Everyone, and they had fun, but then the music, but then the music, and then everybody fingle and everybody finger.
I didn't want to be the only one who stayed. I think sometimes I've got my husband, because he was in my 30s, because he was in my 30s."
Where are the people in the 20s?
Don't do that.
OK, that's a light, but it doesn't make a lot of mistakes, because it's about very much.
If you have been talking about 30s, there's a huge pressure, there's a huge pressure, a career, a career, a city to have a city to have a partner and two or three kids and two or three kids.
Many of these things are incompatible and how researchers are just moths, and you just show up in the 30s, and stressful in the 30s.
The post-Milleniums midlife crisisisisis, it doesn't buy a red lawagen.
It means that you can do the career that you can't do anything you want to do.
And then you realize that you can't have that you can't have a twister, or the kids.
A lot of people in the 30s and 40s and 40s and say, "What did I do have done about their 20s, "What did I think I've thought, "What did I think I've thought, "What did I think, "What do I think, what did I've been thinking about it?"
I want to change what people do in the 20s and think about 20s.
This is a story that shows how it can show you how it can be able to do.
It's the story of ema.
Ema came to my office, when she was 25, because they had 25, because she had an identity crisisisisis.
She said she would like to work in the media, or in the artainment, but they didn't have decided, so she would have not been able to decided them into the last few years.
Because that was cheaper, she lived with their friend who was more of his friends than his temperament than his embitions.
And even though their 20s, their 20s, their years before they were even worse.
She crying in the sit in the sit down, but then she said, "Do you can't look for you, you can't look for your friends, but you can't look like your friends."
One day, one day, Ema, and they never crying, and they're almost all the hour.
She had a book, and she bought, and she spent the whole morning their whole morning their a lot of contacts, but then she strong, she was simplests that came up with the words.
She was almost hysterically, and she said, "Who is when I got a car accident?
Who is, if I've got to create cancer?"
And in the moment, I had together to say, "I don't have to say, "I"
But Ema, no therapist, really, really, really, really, really, really careful.
Ema brought a better life, and I knew that was her chance.
I've been since I had to look at the first patientists too much of it, just too much like Emasterns of embracted in well-making in charity.
The next weeks and months, I gave emails that every 20-year-olds that every 20-year-old, or woman, or woman, or woman,
First, I told you, I wouldn't have identity crisisis, they would have an identity crisisisisis,
And so I thought they were looking forward, they would go on.
Powerful thing that is a investment is investment investment, which is what you want to be next.
I didn't know about embrace and no one knows how the future of how the future of the future of the future of the works. But I knowdentity capital.
So now, the time for this international job, this practices, this practices that you wanted to try to do this startup,
I don't care about the discovery of the 20s, but they're not counts that are not counts that are not a discovery of discovery.
This is procastination.
I told me, I said to Ema: He's working, but what you do.
Secondly, I said, "The Sippy is overcome is overlooked.
Good friends are primate to get to fly to come up together, but 20s, but 20s, and they think about how they think they're thinking about how they know what they know, they know what they know how they're working, how they're working, how they're working.
This new personal new person to come up with new person to come from the outside of the most extraordinary.
New things like this. "This is what we're looking at friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of frien
It's true: The half of the 20s, or even if you don't get accountable.
But the other half the other half the other half the books, they've got there.
The half of the jobs are never been written by the cows. So if you're going to get the neighbors, you don't get out of you.
That's not a bed. That's not spreads.
The last rather: Ema believed that you couldn't look like the family, but the friends.
This is true for them as they were looking for them, but as 20s, but as 20s, she would look for her own family, if they looked at a partner, and a partner and a parent family.
I told her, I took a new family, I would have to look at that.
You may be thinking that it's better, it's better than 20 or 25, and I'm going to be age 20 or 25, and I'm going to be age.
But someone who you're sleeping or lives, or lives, or lives, if everyone in your life, if everyone is not a rather than any progress.
The best time to planning your earning, before you have a habitat, and that means that you're going to be as much as you can be as much as you're working on your work.
Eur family out of your family, and it means and it doesn't want to do what you want to do, and not because it works, or with someone who's time, or with someone who's time.
So what happened to do with ema?
We went through a dropped by the middle of a cousin of a cousin of a cousin of a cousin of museum.
This is a half of her, and they're going to get a work.
This works for a long bottom of their friend, their friend who lived with the friend,
Now, five years later, it's Event Planerin for museums.
She has a man is a man who's aware of it.
They love their new career and their new family and her new family and she sands, "You know, "You know, "You know, "You know, you're not enough."
Emas story is sounds like this, but it's just like everything I love to 20-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-y
It's so easy to help them.
20-year-year-old flight-old flights that are just leave the plane and sort of the plane and sort of the West.
And that's what you can do is a little course, you can do is to make the difference in Alaska or in Alaska or in Fider.
That's the same thing for 21-year-year-year-year-year-year-old, a great conversation, a great deadly, a huge impact on the EDTalks and even over years, and even over years, and even over years.
This is an idea that all the idea that all 20s, all the 20s.
It's so easy to Alex said.
I've got the privileg, this 20s, like Emails, the 30s, the 30s, the new 20s, so you're not going to be an identity capital, you're using yourself.
Definated you don't know what you didn't know what you didn't know.
You're decides now, right now.
Thank you.
In the entire computer screen, it was always been able to relatives us and digital information between our physical world and the lyings of our physical world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the image.
And this is a smaller, smaller, and now, and now, and now it's smaller than a millimeter, and now a touchscreen, and computer, and computer.
But I asked me, how it would be like it wouldn't believe it wasn't a border.
I was like to look like this.
First, I developed this tool that we've developed in the digital world. So if you're going to be strong, so if you turn it into the physical figures the physical figures.
Designers can be directly in 3D materializing and surgeons can be in the virtual places under the screen.
So with this tools, the bordership,
But our hands are still still outside the screen.
How can we interact with the digital information, and we interact with the digital information and use the whole story of our hands?
And when Microsoft Applied Sciences, I've got together with my mentor Cati Boulanger, the computer, and a little room, and a little room, and a digital workplace.
And that's a transparenter screen and taken cameras to the supply and face, and health and face, you can now be used to be able to get to the three-D-Rumbs and Pixel with the blocks and pixels.
There's a window and data, you can have a position in fact, you can choose it's so easy to make a book of a regularly.
And then you can see through this book, and you can marking and words and words and words. All of the virtual touchpads.
Architects can be directly with their models, and they can rotates and red.
So in these two example, we're in these two digital world.
But how about that if we were going to reach the whole thing and the digital information and the digital information?
Surely, many of you have done a lot of you have done to buy some kind of the article online and later.
But now you don't have to worry about it.
Here's an "Online augmented a boxide cabine.
And this views you're going through a head, you're in the head or through a critical display, if the system of our body, the system.
And this idea of leaders, I started thinking about it, I realized, but they don't just in the room, but they can't just start to make them physical, and we feel them.
How would look like this?
In MIT MIT MIT MIT MIT MIT MIT MIT MIT Mitary and my middle of Pixel Pixel.
Now, in this case, this case, this rounds like a three-dimensional pixel in our world. That means that we can do this object, and that means that we can move this object, and that smaller than people in this small rooms in this little 3D room.
Effective, we've got the hardwork and control the movement, by movement by using magnetic levitation, mechanical levitation, and these supply.
And by using the object of digital programming it from the boards, we can record it to the terms of human evidence, and now we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be receive in the real world.
So, like, like, Choreographs are taught or Michael Jordans, or Michael Jordans, and again and repeated and recovered and recorded to be recorded.
If you can use this to use complex concepts like planets like planets and physics and physics and physics, and other than the computer screen or textbooks, and it's a remarkable experience that you can powerful experience and it's very powerful and feeling them
And then, as just the same thing that we have to do is to moment, to materialize materialize how the programming the programming our daily activities.
As you can start to show you, you can't just show us something that we don't just start to interact with us, but with us, as part of our physical environment, without our physical environment, without our real world.
Today, we started talking about the bordership, but if we're going to remove this borders, the only bordership.
Thank you.
I was taken two years to be a turner to become a Turner, China, China, China, in the 1970s.
When I was in the first class, I wanted to send the government, all the unkosts, all unkost all the unkosts.
But my mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to be engineering.
And after they had the culture of the culture, they thought they were survived that the only way to believe that the only way to be sure, and well, and well-d job.
It's not important, whether I like that.
But my dream was to be a Chinese objects.
This is how I'm in the day I live in the day.
Operns of approaches to the early early early, and I started to go to the early tried to go to the opening all the open-ship.
I even wrote the schools of the schools and I wrote the moderator of a radio.
But the adults, my idea didn't.
The adults, they didn't think it wasn't seriously.
Only my friends, but they were also supportunity, but they were also makes me.
And with 15 years, I knew I was to old to old to old to the training.
So my dream would never be true.
I was afraid of my life that I could only have a lucky to my life, I could only have a second choice.
But that's so unexpected.
So I was sitting in the head, another profession.
None of them to teach me to teach me? Again.
So I went to books.
I silence my hunger," I was a book about a book about a significant and musician and musician and Musician Family of Family of Fu Lei," I found my family, while the confused woman, while the confusion.
<unk>"Sanmaos," <unk>"Lecom" <unk>"<unk> <unk>" from Nan Huaijin<unk> 1995 came to the United States, and what books?
Of course, books that are both in China.
"The good earth" is a chinese farmers.
And the eventually, I can't understood. Have.
The Bible is interesting, but it's collective.
But that's a subject for another time.
But that five building a kind of experience: "You should you be your father and your father and your mother and your mother."
"Ihre" I thought, I thought, "the-like, and much better than Goram."
That was my way of thinking about the way to fuzian schools and the relationship to my parents and relationship to my parents.
And by the way, I started with a new culture, I started with the new culture.
This is a lot of insights.
I found this map, I didn't really example, because Chinese students because Chinese students with this one.
It was never coming to meaning that China, it doesn't have to be in the world.
So one cards says something about the personal view of view.
The same thing is actually nothing new learning is nothing new.
In the Academic world is a standard process.
There are even research programs like religional religion and compared science and compared science.
Compare and opposite a complexity of a complex minds of a themas.
So I thought, if I couldn't work in the research, why not working in the daily lives?
So I started reading two books.
You can see, they can do <unk>"Benjamin Franklin Franklin Franklin" John Adamson<unk>" John Adamson<unk> the same evid McCully events, or friends.
<unk>"We're going to be a catharine Graham<unk> <unk>"Whampion," and the life is like a snowledge," by Alice Schroeder. I'm going to compare the same stories, "Cing-James -- "The Bible <unk>Can Bible <unk>C.
And when Christus were the trials, we were political, political and spiritual nature.
And when Buddha, they were all psychological nature: Lust, fear, and social plant.
If you're a friends, it's also makes fun, it's fun, the love of languages.
<unk>"Sinfony for a seavogel" by Thomas Merton<unk>"""<unk> <unk>"The Life, the lifestyle of alan Watts<unk> Anstatts, I found out instead of translating me to found out how much I could win.
And by translation is to me, for example, for example, "Gless" in Chinese word "Good" in Chinese faster."
"Braut" in Chinese means "ne new mother means "neue Mother Mother Mother."
Books are like a magical tor. It's a magical tor. And I have a connection and violence and violence.
I don't know I'm never going to feel more a little bit more.
A crosss a dream is nothing in the compared to what many other people have done.
I'm a convinced that it's not the only dream of a dream of a dream.
His importantly, it's to bring us to bring us to get to the mountains where our passion and where our passion and our passion and our passion and our happiness and our happiness and our happiness.
Even a couple of dream, it can be avoid.
Because I'm suggest, I'm happy today, and I'm smart books, most of time.
Going books, always being with you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was 8 years old, a new girl, and she was so expression, and she was so expression, and she was always seem to be a new girls.
She had long, she had a little bit of a little bit of a smaller writing was good in Geography and in Geography and in bookstably in the bookstably.
In some school, I rasted to switched a technically until I had a team.
So I stayed a day, I remained a lot longer, and I'd girls, and hidden in the girls.
When the air, I was came out, I got took me to the classroom, and I took me to the nodes of the teacher's book from the teacher.
And then I did.
If you were took the Nots of my rivalin, just a few single one.
All of them.
When I wanted to return the book, I realized that some of my other classrooms had a good nodes.
So I correctly correctly, I had all the nodes, all the nodes,
I gave all four and I was an inser, because I was application, but I was application.
I'm still uses to behavior.
I don't understand where the idea where the idea.
I don't understand why I've been so good at this.
I felt really good.
I don't understand why I never been taken.
It was obviously obvious.
I never got never been expecting.
But most of the most amazing me, why did it so much, why was so much that this little girls so good at the bookstably?
Eifically, it's sounds me.
It's so deeply so deeply deeply.
We know that babies undergrounds.
And as Primates. Hills are made by nature, of nature.
We know that eventually, the main cause of the murder of murdership in the United States.
But I never read a study that had reading me to her intention, their long-long-cover their cability or their cover.
And we have to do is we have to read the literature, because the lab, because the lab, the lab, in all of their possible forms of all of their possible forms.
Is it a surprising transition to say that if we didn't have a literature, we don't have a literature?
So no intriguous hands, no "Odyssee"
No effort, no-ray, no "Ats, no "At 1001 night.
No shakespeare.
And so the Leselists of the U.S. six-ship, because we lose the great and Well, "Thall and Well," "Madam" "Madam Bovary," "Ana," "Ana Kary,"
No one of the effect, no proust. I know it's come to say that there's a proust the answer to everything, but in the possible, he's really experience.
This year, we celebrate this year 200th, Jubiles of his mastery of the search for the sexual analysis of the sexual analysis of sexual eventually, and the normal weather, and that we can have hope.
Think about proust, we think about proust, we think about feeling?
We think about the little boys, the little boys,
We think about a piece of cake, in Lavendel teavendingetail.
We forget how raw, how raw his vision.
We forget how he's suspect.
These kind of books are for virginia Woolfulfillarm.
I don't know how catch is, but we say, but we say, it's a pressure.
Let's see why the raoman and the eventually, and the event the effects and proust.
Is it so obvious that eventually reduces, reduces -- history, like this, like this, a story of basis, is a story?
I don't know. I think it's just hard to the painful, because you think about what happens when we think about what happens when we're effort.
If we're effort, we're telling us a story.
Tell us ourselves stories about life of the other people, and they're doing it, because they're so conciples that it's so conciples.
And when he tells the story, and the audience, we know what details, they have to stand the message to streetails in the rips. Ripping?
Eifically, it makes us all to Amateur Romanautor, and so that's what it could be.
And so, "In Swann's woman," and I love," which is a series, one of the protagonists, which is very love, and how deeply love, and how dead, and suddenly, and suddenly, and sentences, and so they're sentences, so they're sentencial, and
Everything they're already and what I could also ready to me, maybe someone else, maybe even in this moment."
This is the story that he's story, and it's a writing from there, and that Swann every new recovered in his guy who he's detected to be instrumental collection in his private following in his private fammer.
We have to give you that Swann and Proustically never been necessary.
Prousts have to leave the country, if they had to do with him.
But you don't have to be simply effort to be a single day. Right?
Eifically, it's encouraging.
It's a hungry, it's a hungry that's just to be danger.
What does the eventually?
Eifically, information.
Eifically, Details.
Eifically, it's long, and small, and little nice and small nearly small.
Eifically, I like photos.
And so it's why instagram.
And the reason is connecting the language of science and the event.
If Swanning these eventually, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, and the door, and the door, and the served this behavior.
He says, "You maybe that's nothing that's nothing, but it's nothing else, an an an anticipate or a drugs or a thinking about it."
He says, "It's scientific intellectual value."
Prousters trying to show that Eifically, and it's impossible and our old, but in their core, but in their core, she's after the truth, and what painful truth, and what Prousthafter the truthority, and what's more painful.
And so, the dumbling, loss, that's for Proust of the wisdom.
He says, "It's a woman that we need to have a bigger, we need a larger, and it's a bread and breaks us feelings as the genius of a man who's interested in a man who's interested in a man who's interested in a man who's interested in a man who's a man who's
Says he tells us that we should look for us?
No. I think he's trying to say that Eifically, it tells us something about ourselves.
Is there a different feeling emotion that we opening us?
Enthnths, anyone else, and we feel our attacks, our early emotion, and our attacks and our attacks?
Teach us anyone else of else of emotion with such a slowly intensity?
Freudy should write about it.
One day, Freudio, Freudy of a very best man who was looking at the thought that was the thought his wife.
And Freud says, this guy is kind of sort of collection, because he doesn't even see what his wife.
Because they're unexplicitely, and everyone knows.
The poor creature is basically underground.
Instead, he looked at things that wife, who doesn't realize its wife, so independent behavioral behavior.
Smile, they're smiled too much with a man?
<unk>Freud<unk> saying that the man to the hills of the difference of the unconsciousness.
The Romean is very good at this point.
But the Romean, it's very good, very good, very good at the middle of the intensive, but not just to look at the moment.
Because the more effort, the more than fantasia, the more fantasia.
And so I think Eifically, I don't need to do that, or illegal things or illegal things.
Eifically, it turns out to be very supporting.
And I think that I think about 8 years, but I think, but I think I've heard about the story I've heard about the news.
A five-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-Acount of Facebook Acount of a year, which was written by itself.
All right.
She tried to turn it to the new friends in their ex-free friends in the school, and I heard the high school, I was listening to the reaction.
Because. Let's being honest.
What is the unfortunately, even when it was deployed, creativity. Right?
This is something from a novel.
This is something from a novel from Patricia Highsmith.
Highsmith is one of my favorite sings.
It's the brilliant woman's the most American literature.
From you're a moment, and "The Talentation," and "The Talent," everything books," and everything about how Eifically, and we're using our spirits, and we're going to be in the mind, and we're in the membrane.
Tom Ripley, their brought their best figures.
First, first of all, you have to be a little bit, and you've got, and you've got away, and you're like a board, and you're wounds. He's reacts. He's smelling your bank account.
This is a way of method.
But what do we do? We can't do it? We can't do it.
I can't be the world, even if I'd like to do it, even if I'd like to do it.
It's a sand, because we live in a new time.
We live in a "eifically,"
We're all good citizens of social media, where the during neid?
So let's take the roman the tissue? I'm not sure.
Now, let's do what Charakthrough when they're not sure if they're not sure of a puzzzzzzles.
Let's go to 221Baker and asking after Sherlock Holmes.
Think of the people on Holmes, they think about his nemesis as a professor Moriarty, this genijor Moriary,
But I always like "Inspector<unk> Lestrand, the Chef of Scotland Yard with the face of a rat, the height of the wood, the holmes, but it takes it.
That's so trust me.
So let me tell you need to be aid, its helps him and it's smooth in the stories in the stories of the stories.
But when they work together, it starts to change, and finally, and finally in "The Six Napoleons" as a holmes, and everyone with his solution, and they say, "We're not news, "We're not news.
We're proud of you."
And he fills to be able to give you a Scotland Yard Holmes, who didn't want to protect the hand.
This is one of the few times that we see him in his stories in his stories, and I find these little scene, and I find these little scene, but also goes, and I'm going to be. Right?
It seems like this, it seems like a emotional, but a physical problem.
In a moment is a waves on another waves like Lestrands like Lestrands.
And in the next moment, they're on a waves.
Suddenly, it's learning to remove this genius, this genius that he's got him.
Is it really simple?
What if Eifically if Eific problem is really just a physical problem? If it was just about how we just went through the other in terms of the other in Because"
And we maybe we wouldn't be anyone eventually.
We could look at us. We could stander.
But I like Notfall plans.
And as we waiting about it, we still have the literature as trost.
Literature of all the evolved the eventually.
Literature, it can be country, it can be country.
And who's all come together, the good light, the good literally, who's fully, who's went to Marcel Proust self.
We're in excellent society.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old and I was about 10 years old and I was airplane, with my father in the Adircraft, a wildness in the northern part of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun is the sun, the blowerful guards, and if there was no path, and if there was no path, you could have been able to take the first people that we could have the first people that we could go through these forest people that would go through these forest people.
We came to our tent to our tent.
I saw the little hut, and I looked at a cliff and blicked a crystal clarifying a little bit of slightly slightly slightly.
And then the roof, a mothers, maybe 4 percent of the core, meter, with apple cored with apple collapse, and age balltery and an old days.
I was amazing, I was a grew up and I was awared.
The tenthood was too launched too long, what they thought they were, who thought, would they thought they were going to him?
The question, and I remained me and I remember.
Who's after us?
How do you do it or where the "uns" or where the same thing," who's going to behind us?
Who's behind us in Rio on Rio?
Here in New York, the city of New York, every day, and every day,000 tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons.
I wanted to know them -- as individuals.
I wanted to understand who makes the job.
How is it, how is it to wear, and these citizens?
So I started a research project with them.
I went to the lashed, and I went down and interviewed people in Bure and interviews and angle, and I learned a lot of city, but I was still a lot of eyes.
I had to go deeper.
So I took a job as a job as a religation.
I'm not just going to do with the lashed. I went on the laser.
And I was the most mechanical best and plants and plants and plants.
It was a remarkable privilege, and it was a privilege experience.
Everyone asks after the idea.
It's not that, but it's not as you think about how to think about the days, and you're really bad, you're really bad, you're right quickly.
The weight weight, you can only be hard.
I know the people who were doing this job more years. The more years. The more lives, and the weights, and the weights, the weights, tons of mothers on the week.
And then there's the danger.
After statistics of working ministeriums is the city of the city in the city of the city of the most dangerous jobs in the country. And I learned why.
You're the whole day in the traffic, all of the day.
Everyone wants to pick up the car, and they don't have enough.
That's really bad for the worker.
And the mothers itself is full of Gife from the mothers and swallows and swallows.
I also learned about the uncomfortability of the mothod.
If you go from the boards and you see the back of the back of the mothers of the city of the city of the city of nature, you know that mothers itself.
He doesn't hear it.
It's also like a kind of attention or circulation.
He has to be in movement.
And then there's the stigma.
You don't want to be able to get us to be able to get a little bit of them -- while you're always wished because you're just going to take a pause of their home, or a pause of their coffeeeeeee, or a coffeeeeeee, and they say, and they're going to knowing that they're going to knowing
I think that stigma is especially ironic, because I believe that the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city. That's the most important working on the streets.
They're the public health.
If they didn't take the mothers, every day, and efficient and effective, and it would be connected to the treatment, and the danger.
Disease that we had been able to have decades and decades, and centuries were able to centuries and we were going to get out of ourselves.
The economy needs.
If we can't get the old cramps, we don't have a new place for the new. The motors of economy, when the consumption.
I don't admitalism, I just wise just to the same way.
And then that's what I call our average, all of our average, all of the speed of speed.
And so I just think, how fast we're using movement today.
We don't care about our coffeeeeeeeee, our pockets or our water bottle or our water bottle, or to make it.
We take them, they're going to forget, because we know that there are people on the other side, because we know that there are people who are care of it.
And so I want to be able to proposed today, how we can think about city to improve the stigma and make it in these difference, and they can make a city to create a city that's city and human.
Their work, I think, I think, is kind of sort of sort of liturgic.
You see the streets of every day, they're rule.
They're wearing in many cities.
You know when you know when you can expect it.
And their work is that we do our work.
They're like a crazy.
The drawing up, the remember, holding us to be safe, ourselves, ourselves, the Absolutely, and that's always have to be able to be able to get every price.
At the days after the 11th, I heard the thunder of a mothers of a mothers on the street, and then I got the son, and running down there, and then the trepecycling his paper Route, and he was like every moment, how every mouth route it was like every might,
And I tried to him for his work, and I started to thank every days, but I started to crying, but I started to crying.
And he looked at me and he said, "All right, and he said, "All right."
"All you know, well."
First, I started took my neighborhood and we met with the man.
His name is Paulie and we worked, and we've been working, we've been working good friends.
I wanted to believe that Paulie.
Everything well.
But in our touches that we have to change the way we change in this planet as a species, we have to look at all the cost of the cost of the cost of the work.
And we'd have to be able to do the people who are going to do the work that we can do their experience, how we can make systems, how we can make systems that we can make sustainability and solve us from streets, which is a remarkable successful results of the last 40 years, the last year,
Cities, if we think about mothers, if we think about mothers, you're talking about mothers, three percent of the national automs.
It's a remarkable statistics.
In your life, in your life, in your life, in your life, if you see that if you see that if you see that, you see it's behind you, you're going to take you set up a moment time to take you.
Take a moment, to make a moment.

Many people don't know, but my parents don't think I didn't believe in a "known."
The manrand of my father was, "Yeah, you can do that! You can do that."
So if I was my three older sister, I wish I wish I was with.
If my three older sisters on a public schools, I couldn't system, my parents, I could go to the school system, and if we couldn't get all the panels, we all have the pantopels of my mother.
My father brought me when I was five, when I was five, by surface, and I just foot and just simply place.
Another one of his tactics, a dollars, a dollars before my nose to my nose to let them far as I'm going to far.
My internal strong, and I was very strong, and as a -- yes, so I went on the first day in the kids, I had a champion that had a champion that had a champion,
And then there was just six Arabber in my city and all my city and all my family.
Today, we have 20 Arabes, and they're still all my family.
I think that no one has ever been thinking that we're not a nobodyalia.
This was in the 11th, and before Politicians before Politicians, "I hate," as a choice," as a choice," as a choice.
People who I grew up with, I didn't have a problem with my belief.
But they were cared to Ramadan maybe I could be able to relationship.
I explained them to me that I could live from my body father, so I could live a months, solar suns of suns of sunshine,
I've been taken on the Broadway.
Yeah, on the broadway. Total.
My parents couldn't afford to send a physiotherapy, so they send me to the tancy.
I learned how to do is dances, so I can use on Abs.
And I'm from Jersey, where it's really important, so if my friends, so if my friends, then I also went too.
And when my friends in their summer of Jersey in the coast of Jersey, I don't know.
I spent my summer in a war in a war, because my parents had not been fearing that if we didn't have any summer, if we don't go back to Palestina.
The summer fatheries, I was to be cured me to be cured me to cure my father, so I was dranked to the brain, and I was surprised milk, and I know how the water, and I thought, and I thought, "I'd worked.
But a wonderful, we found: Yoga.
I have to say it's really boring, but before I didn't have Yoga, I was a stand-up Comedian, I couldn't even even even even stand-up Comedian,
Now, I can stand up on the head.
My parents were always a blood that I was able to be able to do that, that no dream, and my dream, and my dream, and my dream, and my dreaming Hospital Hospital Hospital."
And so, I got to fundamental state of minority, I got a great state University, the Arizona State University, because I'm survey every minority,
I was squasi's house game.
Everyone loved me.
I remembered all the homework of the children, they got to get in all my courses, got in all of my courses.
Every time I played a scene from "The Glasms," I slepts,"
But I never got a role.
In my eventually, the ASU, the ASU.S.
A piece of a girls with CP.
I was a girl with CP.
So I was a person, "Indian, I get a role.
I've got a couple of course.
And then, free! Ende.
God is thank you, I'm ending.
I didn't get the role.
Sherry Brown, the role.
I called the course of the challenge of the challenge, I'd have ever been as if someone, and I wondering my cat, and she said, "Why didn't have the stunts.
I said, "I can't do that, but if I can't do anything, then it can't do it."
I was born, I was born, and they gave them a challenge, and they gave them without CP.
The university of life.
Hollywood is known to be known to get a healthy should be healthy should be able to player.
After the moment, I went back home. My first role, I was a statist in a souap.
My dream was true.
And I knew I knew I was basically, "Restaurant girlfriend" to be friend" to the friend."
But instead, I stayed a glorified mind, I realized minds that was only inside the back of the background that Casting Directors, and I realized that Casting Directors, ethnic, ethnic, ethnic, ethnic,
They only got perfect people.
But exceptions, the rule.
I grew up with Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr and else all these women had a common: They were common: They were common.
So I was came out of comic.
My first job was to be a famous course, it was to Shows in New York City to synows in New Jersey, and I'm going to forget the first comics that I'm going to forget that he was smart, he was on the street.
I'm in Clubsidered all over the U.S., I also have done in the Middle East Arabically, unexpected and unexpected.
Some people say, I'm the first comics in the Arabic world.
I don't like to call me, but I don't know they've never heard about the bad little gradually, and they're not small groups are not going to find us, and they're not going to find us.
In 2003, my brother and father, and father, Dean Overidallah, and I was with the New Yorker Arabican Comedy festival, which is now already festival,
Our goal is to remember, the negative image of Arabican hard to change the media and to change the media and to remembers and remembers and Arabia and Arabia and Arabia and Arabia and Arabia and Arabia.
The same thing about Arabic of Arabically, much easier than the challenge, against the stigma of the stigma.
My big deal with 2010.
I was as a gast in the news, "Countdown Countdown Countdown Countdown.
I came out like took me to the ball, they sit down, they sat down to a studio and sat down to a studio and sat down to a studio and situation.
So I looked at the stage of the stage, and said, "I can I get a different chair, I can get a different chair?"
And she looked at me and said, "Five, four, four, three, three, three, three, three."
And we were live!
So I had to table of the gastic of the gasture, so I didn't know while the scene, and when the screen, and when the interview, and when the interview, I was also a little bit of me.
And so my chance, and I had been trying to do, and I knew I had never reading me.
But Mr. Olbermann ludge me, but I didn't just recorded to a valuable middle of my chair.
And the work of the work with Keith Olbermanned something to do something to say, all of the Internet, three-drights.
People say, kids are grandushed, but as a kid or a children or a funny.
In the World Wide Web, I'm suddenly place with my type of volunteers.
If I look atline videos, I see Comments like, "I see how, how do you look like, "Ey, how do you do?"
"Ey, is the most finally?"
And my favorite: "Arorists.
Did they have near disease?
We should have to kep them."
One of the smart, my tendency in the credits: Drehbook: Drehbooks, comicist, comics.
A terms of appearance is as the heart.
If a role of caves can't play a Rolliest, it can't play a role of caves.
The terms of the biggest -- Yeah. That's applause. Los.
People with terms of minority in the world, and we're the biggest minority in the unlike.
The doctors said, I could never walk, but I could never sitting here.
But I would be social media, I wouldn't be here.
I hope that we can create a positive positive image of education in the media and in the media and in the media.
Maybe it's less hass on the Internet, if it's more positive images.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it's still a village to tell a child.
My journey with Uvironment, I was very special places.
I thought about the red lucted tepet copern Susan Luci and the iconic luci and the iconic lorcy.
I thought in a movie, and Idam Sandler and Idam Sandler, and Idol, and Idol, working with my idols, working.
I'm a main capture with the Comedy Tour Tour," to Gone Wild."
I was representantin of the big basically, New Jersey in Democratic National Committee 2008.
I've been asked "Mays Kids" a wealth," which is tried to give a palestin, palestinian flights, palestinian flights, the breaking my parents that my parents.
But the one moment that most of the most important -- before this -- the moment, the moment, the most important thing that I was the man ones I was the man ones that I fly strating and how a bees, and how a bees like a bees like Markinson and as I got to move.
That was the only time that my father was the only time, and I saw a live from me, and I saw this talk, and I went to genement.
: Mays you're going to be a soul, Papa. Maysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zays."
There was a time that we have a big problems.
At the 21. Juli, Juli, Juli, from Mola in 1969, and the Molaefullo 11 and stand up to the sea.
Armstrong and Aldrong and Aldrong, but their opportunity on the surface was the surface of a community of a community.
The Apollo program was the largest peace mobile photographicization in history of the United States of America.
To go to the moon, investigating NASA is about 180 billion dollars, or four percent of the billion dollars, or four percent of the bundament of the bundament of the bundament of the basically.
Apollocked workplace for 400,000 people and approaches and collaborators, and the companies, Universities and treatments and treatments.
People died, the best pollo 1.
But until the end of the Apollo programs in 24 people to the moon.
From the second surface that his surface, is Aldrin, after the death of Armstrong in the last year, now the last year.
But why did they went to?
They didn't need a lot of milogram, 380 kilogram, and something that all 24 later -- a new sense of this new sense of our common small and collective small and crime.
Why did they went to see? Aynically, because President Kennedy, because President Kennedy, his nation that his nation that his nation.
But Kennedy, in 1962, in 1962, the Rice University University University University.
For time, for apollo is not just one of the West is not just a cold West Cold Western war.
And at the time, this was the most strongest feeling a sense of the first sense of the first senior of technology.
They flying for the moon, because it was something big.
The moonland, the moon to a long-culisse of a long-like technological triumphe.
For the first half of the 20th century, and the flight century, and the flight, and the airplane and airplane and a vaccine and a vaccine.
In the middle of the century, and the polio and the polio.
Technology has been to have something called Alvin Topler in 1970, a "buts" called a "board."
For the greatest part of the human history, we couldn't faster than a boat or a boat, but in 1969, but in 1969, but in 1969, the maneuvery 10,000 kilometers per hour.
Since 1970, there were no human beings,
Nobody has ever been moving to faster than the bright, and the battle, and the uncomfortable optimism, and the power of technology is problems that we've got to solve the big problems that we've hope to fly.
I remember, I remember when I was a five-year-old.
The addition of the apollo 17, and my mother was not too much in the celebrate celebrate textbook.
I had an exciting that this was the last mission, but I was hundreds of mission, but I was sure that it would be in my life, I would give colonies.
The explored "etwhattle with our ability to solve our ability to solve technology to a platform," is to a platform.
You hear it everywhere.
We've heard it in the last two days in TED.
It's a little bit like this, we would have technologists, and they're reloading with themselves with themselves with things like iPhone, like iPhone and Apps and social media, or algorithms, or algorithms.
It's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've longer, and they're remained.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What's happened?
There's a critical explanation from the Silicon Valley, where you're going to be less earlier, where you've been remotely in the years, in the years, in the years, Microsoft, Microsoft, Apple and genes.
In Silicon Valley says, you would say that the markets, in the best guilts, which risks, which risks.
Silicon Valley says that Risks, Risk of it, and they've been moving and students, and to supporting ideas, and states, and invented problems or even invented problems or even fundamental problems.
But this explanation is not good enough.
It's explained what's really explains what happens to Silicon Valley.
Even to their risks, they're friendly risks agostories of little angle of little angle investments with a tiny investment investment investment in the middle of 10 years.
Investors had always had always had a highly energy as energy, which is a huge enormous enormous enormous enormous enormously, and the development, and risks and risks and risks.
No, the reasons why we can't solve problem, are complicated, and deeply deeply.
Sometimes we decide, we don't know the big problems.
We could fly fly, if we want to fly.
NASA has been designed a plan.
But for the Mars to fly a political decision of public decision of public relatively, and that's never happened.
We're not going to fly because everybody thinks that there are important things that are important things that are done.
Another time, we can't solve the big problems because our political systems.
Today, less than two percent of the energy consumption of the Earth's critically remove the solar energy, like solar energy, wind and biocraft, and the reason for it is reason for it is reason.
Coal and earth are more serious than solar energy and wind and wind and wind and wind and wind and winds.
We all want to all of the alternative energy that can't exist. But it's not exist.
Now, it's so that development, companies and economists and economists in principle of the same might be able to do is, which is the same practices and international practices and international energy.
But in the moment, there's no hope, there's no hope that the energy politics of the United States or the international actions and records.
Sometimes are deeply problems that are not solve the technical problems, but it's not as well.
It was long time, it's been prediction of life-called career.
But 30 years of research has taught us that hunger-cost-cost-costrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catast
Technologies can be things like healthy or systems like Lageration and transportation and transportation, but there's going to be a hunger, but there's a lot of governments.
And finally, sometimes are sometimes the solutions, because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon, the Capacity, but you're going to get the war, but you found out that there are many species of cancer, that most of the capacity of cancer, and that's proteins.
Swesome problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve with technologies.
We can have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to solve the publicians and the public, and the public, a problem, and institutions, and we have to understand it.
The apollomision that was a kind of metaphor was the ability of technology, big problems, it filled this criteria.
But this is a model of what's going to be able to be repeated.
It's not the year 1961.
There's no dramatically dramatically dramatically, no politicians like John Kennedy, who's hard and dangerous and dangerous and dangerous and not popular system, and no population of the Science fiction of the system of the system.
But most of the most exists, it was the end of the end of the moon.
He was just three days.
And it's discussing whether this is really serious problem.
We're on ourselves and we're going to be hard to be harder to be harder to be harder to be harder to be harder.
You know, it's missing us all the challenges.
Thank you.
I want to fly to close your eyes.
Imagine you, you're in front of your carry.
And if you look at the door, and the door, and the material from.
Now, you're going to take a group of course, a carbon flying on their bicycles.
It's a naked a bicycle and they come up and you get your carry and your carry.
You have to imagine that really have to imagine.
They struggled, and they were switching yourself.
And then they all crap of your hands.
Bicycles, races, all flying and signs, and signs. Species.
Now, the swell, your wave your wave your living in your wave your wings, or what your wing on the other side of your water, and the side of your windows, and just like the light.
The lights up to the crumble monster.
It's tiny from the back of a yellow brown pathway.
One of the path.

You running the chococoke, because it's writing in the mouth.
Go him ahead of him, in your living room.
Here's your idea of your business, your idea of your imagination.
Their clebrators only the most important, they're sings, "Hit Me Baby One More Time More Time More Time More Time moth.
Now, I'm going to follow me in your kitchen.
The ground was same plants, the same plants and out of your oven and out of your village, and you get the mind, the cogels, Vir Dorothy, and the lions of Ozayer of Oz" and hip.
Okay. Now, open up the eyes.
I want to tell you about a very bizarre weather, which is going to tell you that every year in New York City in New York City.
He's called States Memory Championhip"
A few years ago, I wanted to do this weather, as science campaigns and expecting the year, and the year, and the same year.
It was a home guy and a few dames, and some distinct, and age, and hygience.
They were pleased to be after a hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of numbers.
Larning the name of Dutdens and useful and useful.
And I realized, and they're just a few minutes.
They could be able to focused on who could be the regular cards of a great cards the fastest a card.
That's crazy.
These people have to have to have to have to have to have.
I started to start with some of them.
This is Ed Cook, a guy who's from England, and there's one of the most certainly one of the most important memory.
And I asked him, "It noticed when you realize that you've got this particularly?"
And Ed said, "I'm not an island.
I just got average of average memory.
Everyone who's going to be here, you're going to be average, or she just average.
We all have to do with the technology, and we met with technology, and we've been able to use this incredible memory, and technology, and technology that have been invented in 200 years ago. This is the same technology. This is using his speakers to be using his speech.
And I just thought, "Wow, how comes it's never heard about it?"
We stood outside the weather, and weather, and editors and Ed, this beautiful, and something except for me to me, and something except for me, "Josh, you're a American journalist.
Can you gu Britney Spears?"
I said, "What? Nee. Why?"
"I'd like to teach Britney Spears, how to recipe, how to a great detection of a great cards.
It would prove that the world is that everyone can prove that this is a little bit of everyone can do this."
I told him, "I'm not Britney Spears, but you could bring me to me.
I mean, you have to start somewhere, right?
And that was the beginning of a very smart journey.
And one of the next year, I spent the next year, I didn't just to train my memory, but also to understand how it works, and to understand how it works, and why it works, and what it could be.
I've actually met a lot of interesting people.
This is for example E.P.
He sorrying under the memory and it's probably the most bad and it's bad.
His community is so bad that he doesn't even remembers, it's not even remember. What's amazing.
While it was so tragic, he was a memory, as much of our memory, how much of our memory, who we are.
On the other side of the spectrums, I learned.
Cim Peks.
He was the prediction for Dustin Hope Mans Character in the movie "Rain Man."
We spent afternoon together in the public books in the public books in Salt Lake City Telephone books. It's a fascinating.
And I came back to read a whole stack of a collections about the memory about the memory, Abhbhoods that were in 2,000 years ago, and more in Latin and later in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the
And I've learned a whole thing about things.
And especially, I realized that there was a time to train the idea of training the idea of decipline, to decipline, not too cultivate so free.
There was a time to the people in their memory investigated, it's possible.
Over the last few years, we've been invented a series of technologies, we've been invented by the Alphabet, to the photography, the photography, the photography, the smartphone -- the smartphone -- that's always have made our experience, our experience, and
And these technologies have changed our modern world, but it's changed our modern world.
They've changed us, and I would say that they'd be changed that they've changed us.
Without the need to remember, it seems to forget it seems like this.
One of the last places where you can find people who are still people who are still always training their memory, and they're decipline, and cultivate, and cultivate, and cultivate.
In fact, it's not as a unique, there are weather, there are weather in the world.
And that's what I wanted to know, I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a research group of London, London a group of London, a group of memory in the lab.
They wanted to know, the structure or anatomy of their brains.
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than we do?
They gave them a stack of cognition, and the answer was, and the answer was,
There was a lot of interesting, and there was a lot of difference between the brain of a brain of a brain of a brain of control person, and the control.
If you put them in a fMRI-Machine, and you're inside the brain, while they're snows and images of snows of snows of snows of the brains of the brains of the brains.
It seems like they were using the part of their memory, they use the sense of their memory and navigate respond to the navigate.
Why? And why? And we can learn from that?
The competition to the best memory is going to be a kind of competition of a weather rest of a weather rest of any year, in which every year with a new technology to a new technology to the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of
This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three times more memory, three times.
On the table of himself, 36, 36,000 cards that he's invented by a technology that he's created a technology that he's got a single time.
He used a similar technology to make similar technology to four 140 to four 140 to a half an hour and half an hour.
Yeah.
And even though there's a computation of technology to depress the most competition of these weather, but all of these competition, but all of these technology, all of these technology, the psychologists called "elaborative ecoding."
This is the same baker Paradox, and it's kind of illustrated this concept, it's what's going to be like, if I asked two persons, if I say, "Mer, and I say, "Merman, and I say, "Merman."
That's his name.
And I'm saying, "Merk you to be a person who's a person who's a baker."
If I'm going to come back to you, and I'm going to come back and say, "We know, you know, "We know, I said, "Weah, a few times?
You know what you know, what's the words?"
The person who remember the person named Baker, remembers, it's probability to the words that person who should be the person who should be able to remember.
The same word, different memory, different memory, it's collection.
What's going on here?
Well, the name Baker, you don't means.
It's absolutely unpreciated by all the memory of your head,
But the profession of the baker, we know.
Baker carrying comically knows.
Baker mistakes have missed their hands.
Baker baker, if they're smelling home.
Maybe we've even know a baker.
And if we hear the words, we hear the words, we can do this approach this easy to the word and recalled, the memory, the memory.
The secrets, and what's going on in the memory, and that's going on in the brain, and the secrets, and the secrets of the same way to find the name of the name is to find the name baker in the mountains in the mountains -- the information -- the information -- a career information -- and
One of the exposed technology can be data can be data can be data,
She was known as the memory.
The story is the story is how following, there was a drawing a poetry that was a followed Simonides.
He was a big difference, because when you wanted to do that, because if you wanted to a really big party, you didn't want to make a D.J., but a doctor.
He's got his poems from the poems of memory and reliable, and in the rooment, and the hell, and the hell and struggled the him.
Not only is that they're all dead, they're all unknown.
Nobody can say, who said who never seen, no one knows where who's been obsessed.
The body can't really certainly being certainly.
It's a tragedy after the other.
Simon's out there, the only survival of these catastrophe. He survival of this catastrophe, and he suddenly, and he can see that he can see that he's been obsessed.
And so he takes the popularly, and it leads, and it leads to the tears.
In this moment, in this moment, something that we all know that we all know that we all know that we all know that we all know that we're also never even name, telephone name, or what we can do is well, we can have a very good visual anticipate.
Would I ask you to ask you to find the first 10 words of the story about Simonides, so you would find it difficulty.
But I better if I'd like to remember who would like you'd being in this moment on a language brown path in your foyerd in your foyer, you could sitting the problem.
The idea of the idea of the memory is to make a building, it's a buildings and make it inner crazy and it's crazy things -- you know, it's funny, bizarre, bizarre, less, less, and it's social, it's social, society, it's social
This is a rather slapped on the 2,000 years old latin textextempts about the memory.
So how does it work?
You know, you're invited to keping here at TED a talk to hold it and you want to him out of the poems of the memory, just like Cicero, just like Cicero, it would have been done 2,000 years ago.
You could go to the prediction: I want you to predict your head.
Imagine a madly crazy and remembered story with unpreciated story to remember that you remember that you're going to talk about this great weathered to talk about this great weathered to talk about this great weathered.
And then you go to your house and they're going to get the crumbs on the back of Mr. Ed. Ed.
And that would remember that would remind your friend Ed Cook.
And when you go to Britney Spears, you remember, you're going to tell you a funny, you want to tell you.
You're going to talk to your kitchen, and the fourth, and the fourth, you know, this strange, this strange, and you've been to help you remember, and you've got some friends that you've got a few friends.
So memory remembers of the memory speakers -- not word for word for word for word, but that's just a subject for Thema.
The English eventually, "topically," a sence," which is the sentence, comes from the word "topos" which means "Stopos" which means "Stopos"
These are overrespond to what people think about the people who were talking about respond to the rhetorics in the terms of the terms of the terms of the terrible.
The formulation "an," is called "An't really means "An't really amazing significant significant."
I found that all fascinating and I'm still fascinating and I'm still fascinating.
And for some more memory, a few memory competition.
I maybe I wanted to write about this subculture of the complicitive respond to write.
But there was a problem.
The problem that the memory of memory, the memory colds are deadly colds.
It's like a group of people who sitting there, and they sitting there.
It's already when someone who's sleeping.
I'm Journalist, I need to write about what it's local.
I know that the most atemberating things in the creatures of these people in the head, but I don't have access to it.
So if I wanted to tell this story, I had to try to use my face.
And so I started to get 15 to 20 minutes before I learned to learning my time, I'm going to learn something from something.
Maybe a poem or a poem.
The name from an old year-old year-year-book that I bought.
I had to find that it's amazing a lot of fun.
I could never imagine.
It's not done, because it's not about it, because it's not about the memory.
You want to be better and better and better and better and better, these crazy, these color, funny, funny and hopefully images.
I found myself.
Here's my standard Gemory, and I'm significant memory.
A couple of ears and a small stripe, and a little stripes that were small strips, because Ablenecked fighting the greatest fights of the greatest fight.
I went to the same weather, I had a year I had a year, I was looking for a year.
And I silence, and I'm going to share with just as younalistic experiment.
It could be a nice epilog for my neighborhood.
The problem was that the experiment is not like an experiment.
I won the competition, what would happen. Now what's going to happen.
It was nice, Redene, and they couldn't be able to play and telephone, but that wasn't what I wanted to do.
These are just terricks.
Tricks the function because they're simple ideas about the function of our brain.
You don't have to build a memory or you can build a cards or you can do a conversation to make you think about the faction of your memory.
We're often talking about people with good memory, it would be a particularly be a particular terms of the strong.
Good memory is intrained.
We're thinking things better if we can fit better.
We remember when we're engaged.
We remember, if we can figure out why information, and why information and experiences, and that's meaningful for us to change them, and they can make meaning and figure out what we can do for us to do in terms of our other memory. If we can sense. Iful. Ifill sense. I
The thoughts of memory, these thought that memory, they're all sorts of current.
In fact, it's not even realize,
They work, because they work for us to work.
They're going to be able to be able to be in a way that we don't think we're not normal, in which we are not.
But it's not a recent current.
So things are going to be done in the brain.
And one thing I want to give you a little bit of the way to the way I'm going through E.P., the man who don't even learned to be remembered, and our memory. Our life are the sum of our memories.
How much are we going to ready to ready to lose our own lives, we're going to lose permanent on our iPhone, or our iPhone to look at the people who are rediscovery to rediscovery, how much face we're already because we're soulfill soul, because we are so we are so we
I learned that the memory, in every one of us, in every one of us, incredible capacity.
If we want to be a remember life, we have to be avoid the person who don't have to remember.
Thank you.
In the age of 27, I finally remotely in the companies for a companies: instead of a business: instrument.
In the public schools in New York, I was in New York for you.
As any teachers, I led to tests and Pres and Pres.
I gave up homework.
When the work, I got back to work, I got back to Notes.
And that was the only thing was the only difference between the best difference between the best students.
The I<unk><unk>'s a little bit more stratospharian.
Some of my smart kids don't have a very good.
That's what I was thinking.
What you're in the 7th. She's already, is difficult: Rational numbers, Deczimal numbers of a parallelogram.
But unmannot believe that concepts, I was convinced that all my students could learning that all my students, if they worked, and hard enough,
After a few years, I got to school, I got to the school, I realized that we've got a much better understanding of learning and learning from a perspective of the psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological p
What we can measure in educational creatures, but what if you can see when you get to learning, and life of many more fast and lives from a lot more quickly and learning?
So I left the classroom and I made a remove a task of psychologist.
I started to children and adults and adults in all sorts of olderly, I started looking at all, and I asked me, and why?
My research, and I went to West Point Militarian.
We tried to predict what we were trying to stay in the troops in the troops and what wouldn't be.
We went to the national bookstable bookstable and tried to predict the kids, which children would come up.
We studied jungle teachers who worked in very difficult wondering a lot of teachers, and they asked to the end of the school teachers, and what would be undergresses and what they would be better at the end of their students.
We sleeping partneries with Privating companies and asked to ask the colds, which they're working their work.
And who would be the money would be services.
In all of these different contexts of these different contexts, as a result of human beings of success.
Our course, it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good exception, and it wasn't I.<unk>
It was a half-making.
And by the way, the passion is passion and expression and expression and expensive goals.
And so, by the way, skills.
And by the way, if you're in a future plane, not just a future plan for a week or a week or a week or a month, and really hard to do this planet, and really hard to make this plan.
And by the way, it's life like a marathon, not sprint.
A few times, I started public schools in Chicago Difficago Different.
I asked thousands of students in the under the both survey to see the diversity to see who was waiting about a year, and then I waiting about who made the a year.
It showed that kids with higher-maker deeply, probably probably the approach the probably, even if I could all be able to do things like families, things like families, things like families, even if they were in the same way that they're even safe in the sure of the sure that they'retu
So by counts of counts, not just in Westpoint and in Westpoint and books, but also in school, but also in school, especially for children with Abrisk.
The most exploring thing about this issue for me is that we know that the science is so little bit about how to know how to built it.
Every day, "How do we asked me and teacher: "How do we use the kids?"
How do I listen to children a children?
How do I hold it for Distancialistance?"
The real answer is, I don't know.
But what I know is that you don't know is that there is no diversity.
Our data shows that many talented people who don't just doing their hands.
In fact, it's a sustainable exploring our exploring, but it doesn't talent decrelated, but even inversity, but even inversity.
And so, the best idea that I've heard about the best possible of deal with deal with the so-called conserved an institution.
This idea was developed at the stanford University of Carol Dweck and to learning that the ability to learning that the ability to learning that it's not found itself.
Dr. Dock has shown that kids, if they read about the brain and learn how it challenge, how it challenges, and it's probably challenges, because they don't believe that vacation is probably because they don't believe that vacation is a permanent.
This growth is growth is a great idea is a great idea for the terms of development.
But we need more.
So here's what I want to do is, we're already, we're so far.
That's the work that's the work.
We have to test our best ideas and strongest intuitions and testing and testing.
We have to measure if we've got to be able to be able to have to be able to learn to learn to learn to learn from preparing and from precisely.
In other words, we need to be able to give us more distribution, we need more during our kids.
Thank you.
In the center of my work is the connection of my working of survival of our community and part of the environments of the environments, where architecture of course, and conditions.
Today, I've been as an example of this, <unk>
Both projects are in Swaves, one in Ethiopia and one in Ethiopia.
They also have a common is that the different analysis, different analysis, different perspective perspective part of the final architecture.
The first example, I started with an invitation, a more sticky in Ethiopia, a center in Ethiopia's Haudis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Ad
This is the kind of buildings that we should design my team and I was designed to design what we should do.
First, I thought I wanted to know.
After we saw a few of these buildings -- there are many of them in the city -- we realized that they've realized that they have three wonderful merculate.
First, these buildings are almost empty because they can't afford to buy things that can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, they need to be energy, because the surfaces are made of glass, which is the heat, and then you need a lot of cool, and then you need a lot of cool.
In a city that shouldn't happen, because they've been quite milding, because they've been in the year between 20 to 25 degrees.
And thirdly, she didn't have to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
This is a place with a place with a place with a place and tradition.
And also, I was in our first ethiopia, I was really smoking from the old market with this fascinated markets, where thousands of people, where thousands of people, and a day, and a day.
It also has this idea of public space that's using the outside of activity to create activity.
So I thought that's exactly what I really want to do is not want to make a shopping Mall.
But the question was, how we could do a little bit more stuffic buildings with these principles with these principles.
The next challenge is came to the basically when we looked at the basically, because it's in a real growth, because it's the city of the city that you see on the buildings that you see on the screen.
And it's between two parallelstreets that have no connection.
And the first thing we created a connection between these two streets, and they were all the edge of the buildings.
This is sit down in a generated Atrium that's a freezing space in the buildings, which is creating a form of his own form itself and rainforest form itself.
And to do this highly, we small carbon directly with little caves, which is in every power of the high-down form of the high-being.
I also survive, how do we flying the building?
I really wanted to find a solution that reacts that reacts that reacts.
I started thinking about textiles, like a switch of Bed by Beton with perful, and the air, and the air, but in air.
And then, I was inspiring these beautiful color, and they're ethiopic women.
They have the properties of a fractal geometry and that helped me to give me to give me.
We build this little bit of little bit of these little bits, the windows, the air, the air, and light on the air.
And that's going to be able to use these little lights, which is the light from the buildings that are buildings to require buildings.
It wasn't just begin to convince the businesses, because they thought, because they thought, "Thopping Mall. That's not best."
But then we all realized that these idea of the market is much profitable than the idea of a profitable than the idea of an eyes, because they can sell the idea.
And the concept of the concept of the facade was much, not just because of the materials of the materials, but also because we didn't need anymore, because we don't need anymore.
So we created some costs of costs that we use the project that we use the project.
The first environment was thinking about how we could do the buildings, how we could do the buildings, in a city that could do in a city that had almost during the almost every day.
We created a valuable brought by using solarpanel on the roof.
And we put this panels, we started took the room with the new public space with trees and bars and Bars and Bars and Bars.
This vordinary collection of the roofs the water to the water to the sanitarian eventually.
Hopefully to the next year, because we have the next year, because we've been five. Stock.
The second example is a machine is a master planning and institutions in Tunis.
To such a big project that I had designed the biggest project that I had to design the city I had to understand the city of Tunis, but also the environment, but also the culture.
While this analysis, I was particularly on the medina, which is the 1,000 years old structure that was made by a master of 12 toreging through 12 table, and through almost almost.
When I was after I was the first step, the first steps that were the best streets to create the first 12 blocks, to create the first 12 blocks and engages like the size of European cities like the cities.
And in additionally, we choose some strategic points in the concept of this tape, and they spent the country, and they changed the original patterns.
The last step was thinking about the cell, the cell, the little cell, the little cell, like the project, like the project, as a wider.
What if the best exhibition in a mediterrane for a mediterrane?
This is North South, because of the temperature of the temperature between the two house, and a natural diameter and a natural diametery.
So let's take a pattern that most of the most wirelessly, most of the high-controlling.
And that's the result, it's almost like a combination of an european blocks and the Arabic city.
There are the blocks and the blocks and in the earth, there are these whole connections for footprints for footprints for footprints.
It also fills the local progress that regularly higher distractor in the top of the higher distraction in the earth.
It also understanding the concept of the torn.
The volume has a connection that are community, and they're going through three different water, and they're also making a lot of drawing in very drawings in the middle of the inside of the inside the inside of the inside of the insights.
The roof, my favorite project, the community of the community, the room, which is going to be the room.
And there's all the neighbors and make things together, and things like a 2-cm-calls on the morning.
These two examples have a common set of answer to the development process.
They're in Swaves, you can see the cities that you can see the cities of cities.
In these cities are changes the effective of architecture in the future of the local communities and economic communities like the buildings like the buildings.
And so I think that architecture that architecture, but I think architecture, but paying for the relationship between the community and the environment and the environment, and the environment and humans.
Thank you.
I want to talk about trusting to talk about trust to remember the survey mission.
They're so all of them are so they're all the clifficient.
There's my view of my view.
First of all, a mind-trace, trust, believe, believe a lot of them.
And then a goal: We should be trust.
And one of the task: We should be trust and repeated.
I think the target is the target, and the target, and the tasks of imagination.
I want to tell you another story about a target, and a target, and a lot better an approach to the thing that makes a much better answer to the thing.
First of all, how do you think that why people think that believe that trusted?
And if I really think about it with my actual knowledge: I don't know.
Maybe it's been able to get in some activities or an institutions, and in other ways.
I'm missing the survival.
But I can look at the environment, of course, the young people who are the source of belief that the belief that the belief that the belief.
Look at the materials of persuas, it's not a lot of evidence of evidence.
Social is going to be the people who were miserable, the people who were mainly Journalists and politicians, still misle.
And the people who were very suspended to be very crage, it's still very signed, racial, disease.
We're other is that we're survivalent is the average citizens of citizens.
But is a good movement?
My following -- I think, clear -- maybe -- maybe.
What could they get them sun?
So they look at the general in general information of the people, if they're asking them questions.
Do you trust you trust, you know?
If you ever wondered: Do you have Gembers?
Do you trust to change fish?
Do you trust, you know?
And then you would say, "Inwhere, "Inwhere?"
And that would be a future response.
And if you understand the answer, you maybe you maybe, "I don't trust them."
Allig rational.
And just told you, we're trusting to teach our lives, trusting to teach them.
We don't go from that, we don't know any representing or a clean or institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional
So I could say about this, I could say, I could tell me that I could get to known to go to the first classroom, the first classroom, but I wouldn't be able to teach them, but I wouldn't let them go to schoolbus.
Maybe I know that they're not good auto well-time.
I trusted that my bad news that my bad friend's a conversation on the running, but maybe they're not about it, but maybe they're true.
Simple.
So we know from our attracting how different beliefs that we can look like this knowledge, but how blinds, if we're going to think about trust, if we're abstracts?
The environments are very bad expliciting about the actual confidence because they're absolutely ignored, because they're using the healthy.
Secondly, we get to the goal.
The goal is to trust to trust.
And I think, I think, I think, I think that's why.
And so I wouldn't go to play.
I would trust to trust the trustworthy more trustworthy, but not trust, but not trust.
I even turned on that, I don't trust to trust, not trusting to trust.
And those who were the ones that are. B. Partness in the hands of a certain madoff, and then, like the name of a certain amount of the name of the name of the streets" -- "made" -- "man," I think, "I think," I think, I think, I'm going too much trust me.
"More trust is not a cluster is not a clustered a life.
Deply, smart and trust and trust and be able to be the goal.
And then you say, yes, okay, okay, is not the most important, but the most important, but trust.
The trustworthy of people can be appreciate.
And to do that, we have to look at three things.
Are they completely? Sind? Sind? Sind?
If we're a person in the devoiding to find a good reliable and honestly, and then we have a good reason, and then we have a good reason, and it's trust.
But the person, but unpredictable, then it's probably not.
Some of my friends are completely, and I wouldn't letter, but no letter, because they're compared to them, because they're compared to them.
I have friends that are very in their own communicate competition, but they trust, they're surveillance.
And I'm very happy to be a lot of friends, I'm not a lot of friends, but unlikely.
If I didn't realize it.
But then we look forward, we're trustworthy, then we trust.
Dep trust is the response.
The trustworthy, we have to do is, of course, we need to be hard.
Over the last decades, we've tried to do control systems in all sorts of institutions and institutions and parents that make us feel that we make our trust to make their dignity.
Many of these systems have the systems have the effect.
They don't work like hard.
One home told me, "This problem is that the paper is that the paper than the baby on the world."
Everywhere in our public actions, in our institutions, in our institutions, this problem. This is supposed to beliefs, and beliefs, but for the credit.
It's people like hebs from their hard tasks, by their half-based by half of their bags.
And this is a surely every examples.
So much.
The goal is more trustworthy, and that's going to be trusted if we want to be trusted and the other communicate and when we want to be able to communicate or politicians, or politicians, or politicians, or politicians.
It's not just. You have to decided. It's not just reactions or half the rich.
And now, now,
These as a represent the representing the sense of trusting to describe the thing.
Because it's development, and I trust and trust and trust.
We can do that, of course,
We can win a little bit of trustworthy.
So two people can improve two people in each other.
But finally, the last is trusting to trustworks, it's going to be another.
You can't be able to build what others.
You have to give them a basis, they need to be trust.
So you have to be trusted.
And of course, you know, you can't be usually anyone can't all people to the nose.
But you also have to move to prove that you're trusting to be trusted.
How about that?
And that's happening everywhere. Normal people do it, effective.
Here's a simple commercial example.
The launch I buy my skills, and they bring me back to my skills and they don't ask me.
They take them back and they give me the money, or a few of the sockets in the small color.
That's great. I'm given me to give me a lot of sense.
This is a big moral.
And you're sure that as a vulnerable, it's a very good harvestigation is that you're a very good harming your own words, and that you're going to believe its own words.
So our goal is not very difficult to see very difficult to see very difficult to see.
It's relationships between people, and the increasingly people, and whether the other people, and whether the other.
So the morality is, very less about trust, very less about trust, or intuits, or intuits, or increasingly, or increctly, or increasingly, and how to be more confidence, and how to use people, and how to use people, and how to use humans.
Thank you.
You know, the best participate of the father's films that I can look at the films that I can look at the films.
I love my own favorite films with my own children with my kids. When my daughter four years old, we've been looking at the oz.
The movie, she didn't let go.
You know, of course, of course, of course,
And so she had a good exciting, a glitorize, and a small clean clean clean.
But if you look at this film often enough, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's actually extraordinary.
We live in the day, and we live in a way, and we're living in a specular kids in a specular industry big.
But "The Audience was different.
He didn't have this trend.
It's got 40 years, until this trends up to this trends, with -- another film, a guy, a guy, and a guy, and a girl, and a girls of the girls of the fasting of the enemy.
You know where I'm talking about it, right?
That's what we do.
Now, there's a big difference between these two films, even more differences between "The German "The Audience," and all the films that we look at the films that we look at this today.
First of all, there are a little bit of Ozayer of Oz" very little violence.
The monkey are pretty aggressive, like the apple battle.
But I think if I think, "The Today," today's produced today," would have said, "Thy, you'd say, "Thy, you're a prophecy, you're going to be a perphecy,
Benefit your magical schools to enough to create the computers of computers of the West, the West, the West."
But it doesn't happen.
Another point I think, "The Punctice," very unique," is that the most unique that the most amazing and even closest and even nevertheless and even female.
And I realized the first time I realized my daughter, "Stars," which was just shown, and the situation was different.
And at the time, I had a son.
He was to the time, he was just three years old.
He wasn't a cinoa. It wasn't set up.
But he was the second kid and he was far more important than his sister.
So he's a sense, and he's got a movie, like a piece of his mother, and I don't think he's not think he's not sure that he was sure that he's got to believe it's quite sure itself.
And I asked me what he's asked me.
Did heads up, he's about muthority and Loyality and Loyality and Loyality?
Did heads up to stay attacks of a army to storm the government to storm?
Happed to be able to do that, it's just boys in the universe, and of course, and of course, but of cool, of cool, but while the most time, but while the most time, and it was just waiting the hell of a medailes and an eyes and an eyes.
Compare that with "The Cauberer of Oz" by 1939.
How does Dorothy her film to a good end of a good end?
And by set up with all of them, and a leader and an emotion.
This is the kind of world I would love my kids would be a great deal with each other, right? <unk> and not in the world, in the world, in the world, which is pretty much our world today.
Why is there so much power -- big power -- in the films that are so little bit of our kids, and so few money?
There's a lot of good literature about the influence, the films, the films, and they should read you should read this.
But I didn't have so much about how boys, like J young boys.
I know that Prin Legoing that Prince, Prin Leia didn't use the adults that I could have been using the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the girls and girls and boys.
I think there was this moment with the first covered the first cuss when I was really expecting that the eye, because the aspect of the film, because so ends a movie, right?
I've been taking my mission, I've telling me.
Why are you stand up there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are very excited about its badly to bad and its bad and rewards, and there's no many room for other relationships and other relationships and other relationships.
It's almost as if you're a young girl, and if you're a girl, you should be better, you should be better.
There's a lot of exceptions, and I'm going to take the discovered the discovered every one of you.
But they give you a message to the boys are not the young boys are not the goal.
They're fabulously, the girls, the girls, how they can sit down to watriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarching the patriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarch.
There's no images for them.
There are some grandiose women who women who are writing new stories and so wonderful horrible horrible harmine and catness, and they're still war.
And that's the most successful studio of all time, of course, and of course, and every single one of them, and every single one of them, or a man, or a man, or a man, or a man and his son, or one man and his son, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men
By -- like many of you think about this year, as they're sure that when they slept the movie, "Merida -- Legendership.
I'm going to tell you all. He's in the Internet.
Rember what the critics said, "Merida,"
"Ah, I can't believe that Pixary processinessiness.
It's very good. Let's not there.
But as good as a good as a movies have the piece of these films.
I don't know if you heard about it.
He didn't get so hard to won't getting conditions, but maybe we're going today.
Alison Bangel is a computhorin and has authorin and has taken in the middle of the 80s, who had seen with a friends that they had seen before.
It's just simple. There are only three questions that you need more than a characters in the female, who is female, and says something that's female and says something like this?
Try to replace this process to fill outcomes.
And talk to some women to any other women's time on the film.
And it's about their unlike about something else to something else to kids that they like to both?
Does? Thank you.
Thank you.
Two women who are talking to each other, and with each other,
That's what happens. I've seen it, and I see it, I see itself, I see itself, and love.
In fact, I went to the cino, I went to look at me to look at me, "Argo.
They remember that? All right, well, great in the Oscars, a great position, a common survival of what a good hollywood film.
He falls with white falls with white figured the test.
I don't think that shouldn't think that's not because a grandmes -- I don't know if you saw him, but a grandmother, a message in a message, and women and women and women and women's hidden.
There are some good several sences, in the men in this conversation, from fears, and the great moment, and the great moment, and the great moment, and the game, and say, "Come on a door, you go to the door, "Comebling?"
So some of the hollywood.
So let's take a look at the numbers.
In 2011, under the 1001, under the 1001, what many of the films, how many of the women's actually female main cases?
Else. That's not slight.
It's not as many protects like the number of women that we've just choose in the Congress.
But there's a number that's more than this is the greater than that is going to be.
Last year, the New York Times a study has a study that has led to government.
She says that.
One of five women in the United States, they've been in their lives.
I don't think that the school of all the time of all the business culture.
I don't think that kids have anything to do with it.
I don't even think that music videos and Pornography and pornography, but something that I think that's something that I hear this statistics, and if I think that's one of the things I think that's one of the things I think that this is a lot of sexual statistics.
Who are these guys? What do they learn?
What do they don't learning?
Take itself in the story of a menuing the task of a men's the skills with violence and then the rewards, and then the rewards, which is not redesigned a woman who has no friends and not redet?
So let's take this story?
You know, as a parent, the privileged the privileged, a daughter, just like the ones that are doing this, we find these statistics, and we want to find these statistics, and we want to read.
We have available to the center, and we hope, and we hope that the helping me, but I also asked me if girls, but I also asked if we're going to teach our solutions, or if we're going to teach our sons.
The Netflix-wart, a middle, and I'm talking to the middle of this, and I'm talking about the fathers.
I think we have to record our sons, we just have to receive a new definition of men.
The definition of men's already to change.
They've reading, like the New Economy, Rollen and Brigu and broughts.
They're going to be connecting.
Our sons are going to find a way to find a way to find a new relationship with each other relationship with each other, and I think we have to show you that a real man who's a real man who is a real man who is respects and they're really respecting and they really want to be able to ask and they really want to ask forth and they're as
I think we should say, "Theype of networks," and they're going to find the pieces, if we can find them, and they're going to find them, and they're going to move together, and we're going to bring the people together with these sons.
When I asked my daughter who said, "Stars," you know what they said, "Stars, you know what they said, "Stars?"
Whether Obian.
Whether Obi and globi and glinda.
What did these two common?
Maybe it's not just the glital.
I think these two cases are experts are experts.
These are the two characters in the movie that are more than all the other and their knowledge and they'd like to help them to help them to help them to help them to help them.
And they're also leaders.
I'm like this kind of tasks of attention to my daughter and I fallence for my son.
I want to give more tasks like this.
I want to say, "I want to be in my son," and I said, "They," and they're going to be able to fight," and more efforts to be a team, maybe a team that he's going to help someone to help other people will help to help other people, and helping people will help people will help people, and help people
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about the story of a clinstad city.
I don't know his name, but his name story.
He lives in a small village in the southern Somalias.
His Dorf is in the mogadically.
The thirdly caused the poverty of this village and the village and the hunger.
When it wasn't sort of what he was there, he was there, and he went into the city, and he went into the city, Mogadicu, Mogadicu, the mainstadias.
And when he comes up there, there's no way to work, no way to work, no way to do not experience.
And then he's comes in a tenthood in a tenth of Mogadicuously.
It maybe a year, but it maybe a year.
One day, he's going to be a man who's a man who's a management, then the middle of the night, then the fruits, and then the fruits.
He's true this dynamic group of young people and they give him a chance.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes and to send money to be money to be sending home.
The young woman who's going to be.
And finally, he married.
He starts a new life.
His life has a sense.
As a beautiful day in Mogadicu, under automobomblue home autombs in the air.
This city city city city city city city city city city, the self-makers and bombs and bombs and bombs, and these therrorist group of terrorists with connections with connections.
How could the story of a clinstad city, just tried to urbanized in the grandstadiancial to the air city to reduce itself in the air.
He had waited.
He had an opportunity to a values, and it was the future, and it was the first opportunity that he was the first opportunity to him.
It was the first thing that we call it out of a state that we call "Waithood," which we call "Waithood."
And his story again, and over again, and over against the urban areas.
It's the story of the story of working on the joining johannesburg and London Unruption and London Unrupt and London Unruited and after something else."
Now, people are promise by the city of their grandstadiums, city, city, city, but young people, but young people have no anticipate, but young people have no anticipate.
Often, it's the youth, the youth, the highly highly.
In 2030, three of five-free of five cities in the cities of being age than 18 years.
If we don't know, if we don't have a cities, if we don't have a possibilities, "Waithood," which is the terrorism that are the terrorism," and in the cities of the cities.
In my birth, Mogadicuous, Mogadicuous, mogadic, people under working under work.
70 percent have no work, don't go to school.
They're nothing.
Last months, I went back to Mogadicu, and I went to Madina Krankenhouse, where I was born.
I remember, how I was like I was in front of this hospital hospital, and I never asked me, if I never thought of this?
What if I was when I was to the same state of "Whather?
If I was a terrorist?
I'm not sure what I'm not supposed to do.
The reason for my job for my eye, this month, it was actually the exhibiting of a gipful for young leadership for young leaders and entrepreneurs.
I brought about 90 young boy collection collapse.
We sat down together and we made a brought a brought to solutions for the greatest challenges of their city.
In the room was a young man, a young man,
He was looking at the university in Mogadic and made his appears.
There was no way to work and no way to work and no way.
I remember, as he told me that he had a university, who was working on, working on, working on, the perfectly and frustrated goal, membershaba and other terrorists.
They looked at him.
But this story is a different running a different running.
In Mogadicallyual historically, to get from A to Binders to Bind.
Two-year-year-year-year-driven the street, so that's the best floating the best floorcycle.
And then the opportunity and he realized it.
He opened a motorcycledged.
He started to motorcycles to place to place that they couldn't afford to be surprising.
With the help of his family and friends and friends and he was driving 10 motorces, and he's dreaming in the next three years.
How do we decision of the other?
What does the difference?
I think it's his ability to recognize a new opportunity to use it.
It's the entrepreneurs, and I believe that we can be the most company that we can be the most effective."
It's boy people who are young people that we can create the economic chances that they're looking for.
You can bring young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to young man who speaks to young man who was participants, Mohamed Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.
He helped me to give me a young people who are a young people who are participants, and show them how to show them how to show them how to show them how to developed and entrepreneurs.
It's actually the first florist, the first florist, the Mogadicuously, and until about 22 years ago, and before Mohamed there, you know, you know, you know, you know, if you wanted to be period, if you wanted to be hearts.
If you ask someone asked, "When did you see the last time you saw the last time?"
So Mohamed a ge opportunity.
He founded a landscape, and heating flowers.
He lived a plantage, and he started to survived a mogadically, tulpes and Lilies, and Lilies, which he said, "What Mogadiano,
He started to remove the wedding businesses, and he started private garden and businesses and businesses around the city and he's working on the first public parks in Mogicaluing parks in Mogicalu.
There's no public parks in Mogadic.
He wants to create a place where families and young people come together and how he says that they can enjoying things of life.
Only, just like this: He doesn't need a lot of water because they need too much water.
So the first step is, young people to inspiring, and inspiring, and in this room had a lot of people in this room.
They never thought about it, a companies to green.
They thought about it for a NGO, or for the government, but these story, but these story, his innovation, his innovation,
He remarked them to look at her city as a place of the possibilities.
He remarkable, she could be companies can be entrepreneurs could be full-called.
And at the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges of their city.
They had an entrepreneurs for local problems.
The inspiration of young people and the sharing of a big screen, but young people to have a really big steps to capital, to capital, to capital to the tather to make their ideas.
They need things to be subjects and support and support them to develop their business and start to start to start to start to start to start to develop them.
Bring young people with the resources that they need to be able to give them the connection that they need to use the support the insurance that they need to catalculate ideas for catalystic growth and you're going to create ideas for cities.
For means, for means, I think, more than just the reasons.
It's about the creature of social effects.
Mohamed not just sells not just sells.
I think he's selling hope.
His such a "Free peace is going to be created when he's created the sense of the people on their city.
Adddd streets, the streets that help him to help him to make motorcycle and instanding and instance.
He gave them the chance of the chance of the line of the "Waithood.
These young business effect on their cities.
So my proposed to be able to leave young people to leave their own innovations, and you're going to get their own innovations and you're going to get more stories about cars and "Waiting about Autombs and "Wood Wood and "Wood."
Thank you.
As my childhood in Maine was one of my favorite business, after Sanddollars to look for the coast of Maine, because my parents, because my parents.
But these mushrooms are hard to find.
They're sand to see sand, you know,
But after a certain time, I had a routine.
I started to see found, and I started to see patterns that help me.
And that's developed to find things to find things to a passion to a love for past and the archaeology.
And when I started to study, Egyptology, I realized that the sound that the sound that the sound of my blocks.
Because suddenly wake up in Egypt in Egypt in Maine street in Maine, achth-hour miles, and my sanddollars. And my sanddollars.
And that led me to use satellite images.
I had to see the past to see the past in a map of cards.
So I want to show you how we see how we see infrared to see infrared infrared infrared infrared.
This is a struggle that's an eastern Egyptian Delta.
And the struggled, well, we're using it. We're using it, and we're going to work with false, it's going to be suddenly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly wrong.
What you see here are the chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemicals and -- the old gyption.
What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite satellite an older to find an older city to find a name of years, and for thousands of years.
And it was the main city was the main city of the altitude, more than four hundred years ago, in a hundred years ago, a hundreds of thousand years ago.
The stricts in the Egyptian al-Fayy and it's very critical algae, because it's a big rich response to older range of architecture and religion.
Egyptologists had always knew that the struggledge of Itj-taui, where the pyramid of the pyramid of the pyramid of the red circle of the red circle, but somewhere in this massive swords.
This area of the area of huge -- the flowerful, four times.
From the full of Nil directly, and while, and while he was going to changed in the direction, and he was in the worlds, and he discovered the city.
So what you find is a city in a city in one of the city.
They're to find the equivalent of the equivalent of the equivalent to find the nadel in home and baseball homeball hands and baseball hands.
And so we used NASAs Typography of the landscape of landscape to see a country to see through easy to see through easy to see a change.
and where the narrative,
But you can see exactly, and that's very interesting, this is very interesting, and it means that we can do with the circle that's a position for the city of the city of Itj-touched us.
So we worked with <unk>uite angyptic scientists together to caves to caves, which you can see what you can see here.
This is like high-being caves instead of the ice, just instead of the slimate change, you're looking for human beings, you're looking for human beings.
In a deep of five meters, under a thick slightly from slightly, we found a distance of Toncus.
And this is what we can do is that in this position for Itj-taui, in five meters, we can find a hundred years, we can find a hundred years, we can find the middle of the exactly, to exactly the exactly the exactly, in the existence of It's using the existence of It's.
We found outside, we found a nonclear, quartote, quartz and Achat -- which is a jewelry, and a jewelry.
This is not a lot of it, but if you look at the most smallest smallest smaller riches that were used by Juwels, you find exactly these stone.
So we found a data of the struggledge of this struggled on the middle of the middle rich.
We also found a jewelry for a jewelming for the government, which is a very important city, that's a very important city.
It's not a couple of another one, but we're going to return to these states to show a map.
What's important, we're fundings for youngyptians that are being in the satellite technology that are going to be able to make them the satellite satellite such as big detections.
And so I wanted to learned with my favorite singingings from the middle of the city of It maybe in the city of It was written by It was written by the city.
"We know, is the largest of all the biggest mountain.
There's nothing the same."
TED, it wasn't been four. Chr.
But ideas, but actually, actually, in 1984, Chr. Chr. Chr. Chr. Christmas,
You can compare with the mushroom with the streets are similarly more.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I grew up in Taiwan as a daughter of a counting, and the most beautiful memories, like my mother, like my mother, the beauty, and the chinese signs of Chinese signs.
Since I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for an outside, it seems like this, it seems like the great master of China.
And in the last few years, I could ask this mall, I can do this master, so that everyone who has learning that complex language, and also learning, and it's also learning.
I thought that a new fast method, Chinese method, Chinese, and useful.
Since the five years, I learned every single strips for every single strip for every single strips in the right away.
And the next 15 years, I learned every day, I learned every day.
And we just five minutes to have faster, and it would be a faster and simpler method.
A Chinese leaderships,000 written about 20,000 written.
They just need 1,000 writing 1,000 simple simple simple simple simple change.
The most important 200 percent of you, 40 percent of the simple literature -- enough to understand streets, species, spects, and the basically, or time.
Today, I'm going to show you how the methods to show you how the methods.
Are you ready?
If you open your mouth, as possible, until he's possible.
And that's a "Mouth."
This is a human beings.
"Man."
If the originally, "Fire" a human beings with highly," as if he seemed like, "Help! I'm going to type!" I'm going to take you on the forms of the forms of the forms of the forms of the forms of the forms of the familiar.
This is a tree.
"Bum"
This is a "Berg"
The Sun.
The "Molon."
The signs for "Tor" looks like a saloont door," from the West.
These eight schools are radics.
They're the reason to make a variety of signs.
A human.
If anyone's standing there, then it means "fold."
Are there more, then, then, well, "Begledge" and three a "Man,"
If a human beings, then, then this is the person: "It's like, "It's so 'There's the great."
The human in the mouth, it's like embrace.
He's a "Gefancial" like Jonas in the forest.
A tree is a tree. Two trees forests forests forests forests forests.
Three together for a "Wald"
You can put a plane, and you have a planet, and you have a "Basis."
You can put a mouth, you're going to take it, it means "idiotic."
Simple, because a little bit of tree, because a pretty idiotic.
Rember the fire?
Two flowers come from each other, "he meaning."
Three fire together, many "Flights."
You can put the fire the firees, it means "burns out,"
For us, the sun, the sun, the source of the right.
Two suns together, "though."
Three, "Funks."
If the sun and the moon and the moon, it means "Hell,"
In the next day, it can also stand for the next day.
The sun is about the horizon, sunshine.
To. A breadtts in the door, "Riegels."
Platzing a mouth in the door, it means "Fraging,"
Sounds, clop. Is anyone?
This person is badly bad. "flowing."
Links is the "Frau."
Two women together for a "Streit."
As approach three women: "Incy.
We now have 30 schools, we known for 30 schools.
With this methods, you can take out of the first eight radicals.
The next group of eight signs with eight signs together.
With a little bit of fears, you can learn a few hundred school, like a hundred school child.
If we can start to use these signs, we can start together.
Fift example, Berg and fire and firefer, so the fire, so a "Vulkan."
We know, Japan is the country of the land of the sun.
This is the sun, the Sun, because Japan, because Japan, because Japanese.
One sun, one sun with the origins, "Japan"
A human behind Japan?
One "Japanese."
The written the left is two mountains are two mountains are two mountains.
In the classic Chinese Chinese chinese chinese chinese coffe, because Chinese coffs in Exily considered their political focused on the mountain.
Today, "Exil" today."
A mouth that says, where it goes out, "Ausgang"
That's the slide that reminds me of this stage. Thank you. Thank you.
