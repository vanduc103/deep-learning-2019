When I was in my 20s, I had my first psychotherapy psychotherapy.
I was Doctorandin and studied clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman called Alex.
When Alex in the first situation came, she came up Jeans and approached the sofa in my office, and she was sitting their sandal and tell me how they would be talked about men, and he told me about men.
And when I heard that I was similar.
My commilitonininines, which is a brandstifter than first patients.
And I got a woman in the 20s, who wanted to talk about Jung.
I wrote that I thought I thought.
But I didn't have it.
With the lust stories that the Alex with the situation, it was easy for me, it was easy to take the problems, while we're going to give us the problems.
"30 is the new 20," said Alex and I could have appreciate that I had a bit of it.
worked later, he came later, he came later, children came later, even the death came later.
People like Alex and I didn't have anything.
But as soon asked me to ask my bedroom, Alex's Liebes.
I'm going to go.
I said, "Yes, she sounds with men, she's sleeping their nive, they're going to be sleeping with a sister, but she's not going to be him."
And there said, "Well, not, but maybe not, but maybe they're the next.
And then the best time is the best time at Alex's early attachment that before she's worry."
This is what Psychologists called aha-Moment.
This was the moment that was not aware of me that 30, not the new 20.
Yes, people later, people later, but it's never been never as early as early 20s, 20s, 20s.
The map of the optimal development, and we sat down there, and we sat down there, and we sat down.
And I realized that these kinds of harmless value of harmless vision was a serious problem with real consequences. Nich is only for Alex and their love, but for the cartrate, but for the carrating and expects of all the people in 20 people.
So at that point, there's in the United States 50 million people in the 20s.
We talk about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent, or 100 percent, if you think that no one of the adults without the 20s.
Meldet you're in your eurs,
I want to see a few of you see.
Oh, yeah! You're all incredibly all incredible.
If you work with someone in the 20s, a love, a love, because one in the 20s, I want to see you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
My spectacials, people are in the 20s, because I think everyone's going to know that everyone's going to know what psychologists, which is psychologists and fears, neurologists and fears that are just longer and the most simple of the most simple of the most simple of the most simple of the most sim
This is not my opinion. These are facts.
We know that 80 percent of the most present moments, in the time to 35.
That means that 8 of 10 decisions, experiences, experiences and Aha-Erlebnces that are going to do what it's going on, until her middle of 30.
Well, if you don't panish if you're talking about 40.
This group is going to go, I think it's good.
We know that the first 10 years of a boy 10 years of a board of a bit of money, how much money you've been used to be money.
We know that with 30 more than the half of Americans, or the American or with the future, or a relationship or a relationship.
We know that the brain and last big wake and last last growth in the 20s, and for the 20s, and for the adults, which means that whatever it means that whatever it would be trying to do that.
We know that the personality of the 20s of the 20s of the 20 percent of the 20s, and that the fruit of women with two in life and that the women with 28 her high-five things that complicated and that's complicated.
So in the 20s, you should go on the body and the own own own own own opportunities.
If we think about the development of a child, we all know that the first 5 years for language and least 5 years for language in the brain and eventually.
It's time in the same time, all of the same life, all of a survival lives on the future.
But we hear about it, there's something like this, there's something like expectations and our 20s of the 20s, and our 20s of time.
But that's not going to listen to the 20s.
The presses are reded over time, the newspaper of the adults.
You know, scientists called 20s, 20s,
Journalists thinking about the spitznames for people in the 20s of people in the 20s," or "Twixters" or "Kids."
That's true.
When culture, we have the trivialized what's going to do is for the adults for the adults.
Leonard Bernstein, my big things with a plan and something about a plan and something to be a little time.
Doesn't it?
So what happens when you're going to happen in the 20s of the head and says, "You get 10 years," and says, "You know something out of your life?
Garn't.
This human is the humanity and the distribution and the distinction, and it doesn't happen.
And so every day intelligence every day intelligence people in the 20s, like their 20s and tills and tills and till me in my office and say, "I know, I don't know, I don't know, but this relationship. I don't sleeping the time."
Or they say, "All say, "All I did it with 30 years ago, my career, my career, everything is good."
But later, it's like, "My 20s are almost 20s, and I didn't have anything.
I had a better life when I was just a better life when I was just going to be able to decided."
And then it's like this, "In my 20s was partners, my 20s was partners like the journey.
All right, and everybody was suddenly, but then with 30, the music, and everyone started to suddenly and everybody went down.
I didn't want to be the only one that I've been standing my man, I think I've been going to be in my 30s, because he was in my 30s."
Where are the people in the 20s here?
Don't do that.
OK, that's a light, but doesn't make a mistake, because it's about a lot.
If many of the 30s, there's a lot of them is there, there's a tremendous pressure, a career to start a career, a city, a city and two or three kids to have a lot of time.
Many of these things are incompatible and how researchers are now showing you just just show you just might just like this, and more than all of these 30s.
The post-Millions of Midlife crisisism doesn't buy a red sports of sportwagen.
It means that you can do the career that you can do not do.
For me, you can't have this child, or the kids you want to give you a business.
A lot of people in the 30s and 40s, and 40s, and say, "What do I do have made me thinking about their 20s, what do I've been doing?"
I want to change what people do in the 20s and think about 20s and think about the 20s.
This is a story that shows how it can sell.
It's the story of Ema.
Ema came in my office, when she was 25, because she was 25, because she had an identity.
She said they would like to work in the middle arts or in the entertainment, but she would have not decided to have been able to have been able to have been done in the past years.
Because the bill less, she was lived with her friends who were more his temperament than his temperament as his embitions.
And even though their 20s, they were still hard, their years before.
She winten in the situations, but then she sat down and said, "You can't look at it, you can't look at it, but your friends.
One day, a day, very never magically, and I finished the whole students almost the whole stounds.
She had a great book, and she spent the whole morning all the morning contacts, but then she starts to the listening, but then she starts to the words that they came up.
She was almost hysteric, and she said, "Who's going to be a car.
Who is going to try and I've got cancer?"
In the moment, I had together to say, "I"
But Ema needed not therapists who really needed to be really, really, really, really, really,
Ema needed a better life, and I knew that was her chance.
I had been since my first patients too much of its first patients too much of how emasy in the emasy of decades in wealth decade.
In the next weeks and months, I gave Ema three rocks that every 20-year-old, whether Mann or woman, whether Mann or woman,
First, I told Ema, I would have an identity, she would have no identity, they would have a lot of identity.
And I was looking at them, they would look like this, they would go on.
Does something that's a investment is investment investment in something that you want to be.
I didn't know about emasily wall and no white and no white, like the future of works. But I know how the future of works. But Identity.
So now, now the time for these international job, this practics, this practics that trying to try to try to do.
I don't smaller here's not the discovery of 20s, but the 20s, the early not countries that are not a discovery.
This is procastination.
I said to Ema: Healthy works, but what makes you do.
Secondly, I said, "Irbane Sippiecy is over-bane.
Good friends are primate to get to the airport, but 20er, 20s, but 20s that are hocking with people who think they're thinking about how they know what they're know how they're know what they're going to know how they're going to talk about how they're working.
This new person to be coming this new person to be coming from outside of the extraordinary environment.
New things that looks like this. "scape," so from friends of friends of friends of friends.
It's true: The half of 20s is undergrounded or not clearly.
But the other half of the other hands, and they've been there, they've been there.
The half of Jobs are never been written by the jobs. So if you could be able to contact with the cows, it doesn't get away from her job.
This is not a bed. So that's not a bed information.
The last Rat: Ema: Ema believed that you couldn't look at the family, but the friends.
This is true for her as she was looking for her, but as 20s, she would be balded their own family, if they looked at a partner from a partner and a few family family.
I said, "You know, a new family, a new family.
You may think it's going to think that it's better than 30 or 25, and I'm going to stimply being in 20 or 25, and I'm trying to you.
But anyone who's sleeping with your life, or lives, in your life, if everybody on Facebook, if everybody's not a progress.
The best time to plane, is to plan, before her a habit, and that means you have a huge in the love of how to be in the love of how to be in the love.
Eur family looks like, means, you know, and that means and that's what you want to do, and not because it works, and not because it works, or with anyone who's greatly recognize the time.
So what happened with Ema?
We went through her Adress book, and she found the middle of a cousine that was working in a mouth in a museum.
This is a bandwake band, you get a work.
This works long-term working their friends, their friends, their friends,
Now, five years later, it's event-Planerin for Muse.
She has a man whole thing that she's consciously choice.
They love their new career and their new family and her new family and she sands me a map, "Your is the goals: "Your're not enough."
Emasmas story, as if it was simple. But that's what I love about 20-year-olds.
It's so simple, to help them.
20-year-olds are like strong flights that are just leave the flights and sort of flights and somewhere.
So after the start can make a little course of the difference, whether you're in Alaska or in Alaska or in Fider.
The same thing that's the same for 21, 25-year-old, a good conversation, a great conversation, a great enormous enormous expecting TEDTalk can be a enormous expecting generation.
This is an idea that all 20s, all 20s, who should know their colds.
It's just like what I was like to Alex.
I have the privileg, these 20s like Emazils, like Emazils: The 30s are not the new 20s, so he's going to be a identity, so it's a identity, used to be used to be a capital,
Defines don't think about what you don't know about what you didn't do.
You're decided to talk about your life.
Thank you.
In the whole computer scientists, it was always our goal, and the digital information between us and digital information between our physical world and the world and the world of our physical world and the world in the world, where we can explore our image.
And this is smaller, little more smaller and always smaller, and now it's smaller than a billion of a touch of a touchcreases, and computers are becoming a touch for everybody.
But I asked me how it would be like it if it wasn't believe it.
I've been looking at how this looks like this.
First, I've developed this tools, which is a digital world, so if you get away. So if you're strong, so if you're going to be the physical figures.
designers can be able to turn their ideas in 3D materializing and chiracters can study the screen organs.
So with this tools, the border was broken.
But our hands are still extraordinary of the screen.
How can we interact with the digital information with the digital information and there's the whole story of our hands?
In Microsoft Applied Sciences, I've been together with my mentor Cati Boulanger, and a little room, and a little room of the tastature of Tastatures in a digital workplace.
So by terms that a transparenter screen and tields of fingers and face, you can be combined by fingers and face you can now be high-time high-Ra-day-Raum.
There's a position and date dateia, in fact, you can have a position in fact, you can choose them from a rain of a regal.
Then you can marking through this book and dictionary and words, and we hearing this on the virtual touchpads.
Architects can be directly directly with their hands and red.
So in these two example, we're in these two example, so we're in the digital world.
But how would it be if we're going to take the whole thing and the digital information and the digital information?
So, many of you have made many of you have made a lot of young people to buy article involved and later.
But now you have to do that, you don't have to do anymore.
Here I have a "Online-Augms of anncideo.
This is what you're going to tell you through a head or through a head or through the system that the system that the system of our bodies.
These idea that I began to think about it, I started thinking about this pixel not just in the room, but they can't just do it physical, so we can feel them.
How would a such a future?
In MIT MIT Media Lab, Ishi Ishi and my member Hirishi and my middle worker Rehmixel.
Now, in this case, in this case, this rounds like a three-dimensional Pixel Pixel in our world. That means that significants, and that means that we can move this object, and in this little 3D.
We have the effective of the shock and control the movement and control the movement by by magnetic levitation, mostly by mechanical anti-fassement technologies.
So in the object, we're programming, we're going to be away from the branches and time, and time, and time, the human movements now, and then you can get the real world.
So, like, B. Choreographia has been taught or michael Jordans, or Michael Jordans can be repeated and again and again and again.
Like this can use this, to use complex concepts like planets and physics and physics. And different than computers, and different than computers or textbooks or textbooks, and they can feel like this, and they can feel like a very reference, and they're very feeling.
And even more exciting than just what we've moment in computer, it's going to make materialize how the programming the world is even our terms of the world.
How do you can't be digital information, but not just show us something, but not just showing us to interact with us, as part of our physical environment, without our physical environment, without our real world.
Today, we've started talking about the boundaries, but if we talk about the boundaries, but if we're going to be a single border.
Thank you.
I was trained two years to become two years to become a turner in Hunan, China, China, China, China,
When I was in the first class, I wanted to government on a school for Athlete, all the uncovery.
But my mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to be insight as they were inside how they're going to be inside.
After they had the culture of culture, they think they were believed that the only way that the only way to be a single way to go back to the single payer and good pay for a little bit more jobi.
It's not important, whether I don't.
But my dream was to become a Chinese openers.
This is how I'm going to play on my day in my clavier.
Operners, a victims, very early fresh with the Acrobatics. So I've trying to go to the open in the ops.
I even wrote the shoots and I wrote the moderator of a Radioshow.
But the adults of models, my idea.
The adults don't think it wasn't think it was serious.
Just my friends, but they were also understanding, but they were also doing it, just as I do.
And with 15 years, I knew I was told to old, to still with the training.
So my dream would never be true.
I had afraid that I could have the rest of my life, only one of my life,
But that's so unfortunately.
So I was able to find a different task, another treatment.
No one to leave me something? All right? All right.
So I went to books.
I was still in my heart of approach to your rather than a scription of the book and musicians and musicians," and Musician<unk> I found my family of Fuily." I found my family woman who could be able to transform the village.
<unk>"Sanmaosa's Lamerk" <unk> <unk>"Lech<unk> <unk>" by Nan Huaijin<unk> 1995, and what I did I first in the United States?
Of course, the books that are books.
"The good Earth" is about the Chinese based on the Chinese box.
It's not simply not as a propaganda.
The Bible is interesting, but it's interesting.
But this is a subject for another time.
But that five building a kind of experience: "You should you be your father and your father and your mother."
"It's like, I thought, "the's so different than brain."
This was my way and way to recording to fuzian school, and the relationship to my parents and the relationship.
And by the way, I started with a new culture, I started with a new culture.
This is a lot of a lot of a blank.
I found this map of cards, I didn't really card to grow up because Chinese schools with this one.
It was never came to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
So one cards says something about the personal sense of personal sense.
The same lesength is nothing news.
In the Academic world is a standardian world.
There's even researchers like compared as compared to the same rules of science and compared literature science.
Compare and opportunity to make a complex constant change.
So I thought if I was compared to work in the research in the research, why not in the death?
So I started to read two books.
They can do from people -- "Benjamin Franklin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson<unk> <unk>John Adams" from David McCulling<unk> McCully, or founded by friends.
"We's during!" from Katharine Graham<unk> <unk>"Warren's like a shoes -- the life is like a shoes of Alice Snowled<unk> I'm going to do this same stories -- <unk>King Geny.
In Christus were the trials, we were able to political and spiritual nature.
In Buddha, they were all psychological nature: Lust, From and social plants -- interesting.
If you have a friend language, it makes it makes fun, the love of love in two language.
<unk>"Sinfony for a seavogel" from Thomas Merton<unk> <unk>"Der Lunch of the water -- the lives of the Taoism" of Alan Watts<unk> Anatts<unk> Anatts<unk> Anatts<unk> I could found out how much I could found out how much I could found.
Through, for example, for example, for example, "Glucky" in Chinese words," in Chinese wish."
"But" in Chinese means in Chinese means "neue Mother Mother." Ohohoh. Ohohoh.
Books are for me, like a magical tor. It's a magical tor.
I don't know I'm never feel like a little bit of a collection.
A camplace is nothing in the comparison is nothing in the comparison.
I'm going to come to the survey that it's not the only cover of a dream.
His important standing is to bring us to us with the leaders where our lives are coming back where our passion and our passion and our lucky and our happiness.
Even a couple of dream can be able to make this tissue.
Because I'm here today, happy, happy again, again, and with a clear book, mostly, most of time.
Maybe books with you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was 8 years old, a new girls in the class, and she was so impressive, and she was so impressive, as new girls.
She had longer belief, and she was a little bit of small, and she was good in Geography and in the book.
In some schoolject, I was rubbered eventually, until I had a team of planet.
So I finished a day, I finished a lot longer, and I hidden, and I hidden in the girls.
When the air, I was reinventually, I found myself in classroom and took me to the nodes of teacher.
And then I did.
If you have the nodes of my rivalin, just some of my rivalin, just some of the same thing.
All of a second.
When I wanted to go back to me, I wanted told me that some of my other classrooms, also had good nodes.
So I corrigated in the eification of all nodes, all nodes, all nodes.
I gave all four and myself, I was a serious because I was also the whole time.
I'm still used about my behavior.
I don't understand where the thought of the thought.
I don't understand why I've been so good at this.
I felt really good.
I don't understand why I never been asked for it.
It was so obvious.
I never expect.
But most of the most paper me: Why did it so much that this little girls so good at this little girls?
I mean, I'm smelling me.
It's so himnisful, so deeply.
We know that babies are living in efforts.
Once as Primates. Hips are from nature from nature from nature.
We know that eventually the main cause of the main murders in the United States in the United States.
But I never have a study of study that I could recognize their long-term or their making nerves.
So we need to be able to give us the literature, because the laborature is the lab, in all their possible forms of all their sorts of forms.
Is it a survivality to say that if we didn't have a paper, we would have no literature?
So no untretretable Helena, no "Odyssee."
Not eventually, no night-profits, no "And-19"
No Shakespeare.
There are the lesists of the U.S. six-Schulen, because we lose, "Shall and Wahn," because we saw "Fiesta," "Fiesta," "The Bovary," "Ana Karina.
No eventually, no proust. I know that it's in Mode is to say that Proust the answer is that Proust the answer is all the answer to everything.
This year, we celebrate the 200th, Jubiles his masters "An the sooks of the sexual analysis of time," and his green analysis of sexual eventually, and that we can have hope that we can have hope.
Think about proust, we think about prouds, right?
We think about the little boys who try to sleep.
We think about a piece of cooking in Lavendel Teep.
We forget how raision was like out of his vision.
We forget how he is experience.
These kinds of books are for virginia Woolfulfills like catzing.
I don't know how catzing is, but we say, it's a pressure.
Let's look at why the Roman and the eifery the eifery and Proust and Proust so well.
Is it so obvious that eventually reduced on person -- reduced to person -- Hinders -- Hinders, that's a story?
I don't know. I think it's just hard to the pain, because think about what happens when we think about what happens when we're really happened when we're really careful.
If we're really careful, we're telling us a story.
He told us ourselves about the lives of the other people and they're bad about the other people, because they're so conciples that it's bad.
When healthy of the story and the audience, what we know what details to stop the message to street the message?
Eife is making us all of us all of us to Amateur Roman, and so that can be powerful.
And in the first band, "In Swanns world," in the Roman-Rei, Swann, one of the protagonists, and how to be very love and how to be able to suddenly, and how to suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly, so they're a suddenly suddenly suddenly,
Everything they're already me and what I could also ready to do is also someone else, maybe even in this moment."
This is the story that he's telling you, and from there, and from there's a proust that Swann every new reized that he was discovered to be able to be in his private in his private following in his private following.
We need to be survey that Swann and Proust necessary.
Prousts friends would have to leave the country when they were going to have to do with him.
But you don't have to be embrace to be a single thing to do is hard work.
It's approaching.
It's a hungry, it's going to be enough.
What may be the eification?
Eife magic information.
It's like a magails.
Eife maybe longer beliefs, and little numbers of small numbers.
Eife maybe photos.
So this is why it's also successful.
In the reason white Proust the language of science and the eification and the eification.
If Swanning this eification, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, and the divided the dying of his money, and the distinction.
He says, "You may think that's abstract, but it's nothing but it's nothing to interpreting a drawing or a drawing."
He says, "It's scientific difference with you realize intellectual value."
Proust trying to show us that eventually is impossible and our older, but in their olds, but in their core, it's a small, and the truth, the truth, the truth, and what Proustroust, and what's going to do is better.
Cummer, Dema, the possible -- that's for Proust of the way.
He says, "I woman who we need to have to make us a larger, decided us a bigger and bigger and bigger spectrum of a man who's interested in the genius of a man who's interested in the genius of us."
Say he's talking about it, we want to look at us?
No. I think he's trying to say that eificians told us something about ourselves.
Is there's another feeling that we open up to this particular way?
Enthers anything else else, our emotion, our agression, our approaches?
Let's kind of different feelings with such as such as such as such as such as well?
Freuddenly, I should write about it.
One day, Freudd was a very best young man who was surrounded by the thought that his wife was that his wife.
And Freud says, this guy is kind of sort of sort of collection because he doesn't even behind his wife.
Because they're uncomfortable, and everybody knows that.
The poor creature is basically under the creature.
Instead, he looked for things that looked at his wife, without behavior, so independent behavior.
So they're going to be very, or strong with a man?
<unk>Freud<unk> says that the man to the hill of the difference of the difference of his wife.
The Roman is very good in this point.
The Roman is very good, very good, very good, how eventually, but not exactly intensive, but not exactly.
Because the effective, we're going to be more quite fantasies.
So I think that eventually, I don't want to make us feel or illegal things.
Eiformally, it's trying to be very invention.
And I think about 8 years, I think about 8 years, but I think about the story I've heard in the news that I've heard in the news.
A 52-year-old woman from Michigan, because they were false from a self-year-old Facebook-country, a year-countains, which was written by self-countries.
All of the year.
She tried to free friends of their ex-free friends in school and I give it, and I give it, I was listening to the admitted.
Because. Let's actually being.
What is uncomfortable, even if also deplace, creativity. Right?
This is something from a Roman.
This is something from Patricia Highsmith.
Highsmith is one of my favorite scripts.
It's the brilliant woman's collection of American literature.
And you're called two friends in the stuff, and "The Talent Mr. Ripley," all books that can be about how electricity -- they're used to be in this room, and we're going to be in this room, and we're going to be in this room in the memory, which is the memory of the mem
Let's take Tom Ripley, their books.
First of all, Tom Ripley you and what you have, and what you have, and what you've got astrated, and you're like from the Earth, and you're talking about your name, he's going to tell your name bank.
This is a method.
But what should we do? We can't do it? We can't do it.
I can't be the world, even if I'd like to do it, even if I'd like to do it.
It's a sand, because we live in a newspaper.
We live in a "eifer-dime magnitude."
We're all good citizens of social media, where the during news is the truth.
To be the roman of the evidence? I'm not sure.
Now, let's do what Chara actors are doing when they're not sure if they're in the best.
Let's go to 221 bacter Street and asked to Sherlock Holmes.
Think about holmes, they think about his nemesis as a professor Moriarty, this genius, this genial consumption.
But I always moving <unk>Inspector<unk> Lestrade, the cowland Yard Yard Yard with the face of a road that holmes, the Holmes Genie Molmes Genie.
This is so trust me.
So the lestrade of his help, it takes its helps him and trees in the stories of the stories.
But when they work together, begins to change something, and finally, and finally in "The Six Napoleons" as Holmes income and all with his solution, and all of his solution, and says, "We're not going to be new message.
We're proud."
And he's going to be able to give you apply in Scotland Yard, the Sherlock Holmes don't want to holmes.
This is one of the few males that we see Holmes in his stories, and I think that little sense of these little small sense of these little sky?
It seems like that, as a six emotional, but a physical problem.
In a moment is the Holmes on another waves like Lestrade.
And in the next moment, they're on a waves.
Plike it's literally leses to remove this genius, that he's been taught him.
Is it really simple?
What if you were really a physics really just a physical problem? If it would be a physical problem? If it's just like we're going to be inside the other relationships?
Maybe we wouldn't have anyone else excellent.
We could look at each other.
But I like Not photographs.
While we waiting about it, we've still the literature than Trost.
Literature everything eventually the eification.
Literature everyone can be cut, they're going to be a bit of them.
And who's all coming together, the good lestrade, the good lestrade Tom Ripley, the marcel Proust Swann, Marcel Proust.
We are in except in excellent society.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old and on a camping camping with my father in Airondack Gebird Gebird, a wildnisdom in the nork.
It was a beautiful day.
The Wald funkled.
The sun is the flowers like the blindows like the blash, and if there was no path, and if there was no path, you would have been able to take the first people who would have been able to take the first people who walk through these forest people who go through these forest people.
We came to our collection.
I saw the little hills on a clippe and blacked over a clippeared about a crystall crystal sea, as a little bit of silk.
Hinter the roof was a mothers, maybe 4 percent of 4 percent of Apfel core, with Apfel Kerneath roominiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminium.
I was amazing, I was waiting and I was used.
The same was too launch too launch what they had been doing -- who said, "Well, they thought they were looking for them?
The question, and I was left me and I was.
Who is it going to look like?
How do you also see it or where the "uns" also behind us, who's going to be in Istanbul on?
Who is it down to the Rio? Or in Rio? Or in Paris or in London?
Here in New York City, the city of every day, every day, every day about 11,000 tons of tons of tons of recycling slings.
I wanted to know them -- as individuals -- as individuals.
I wanted to understand who makes the job.
How is it, a uniform to train and this citizens?
So I started a research project with them.
I went to the lashing, I love the route and interviewed people in Bros and ants and ants in the entire city. I was still a lot of eye, but I was still a lot of eye.
I had to go.
So I took a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as
I don't just go to the laser. I went to the lashing.
And I thought most of the mechanical bests and plants.
It was a remarkable privilege and an experience and an experience.
Everybody asks after the thank.
He's because it's not so present, and in fact, and in fact, and you think it's really hard to the right.
And the violence you're just hard.
I know people who made these jobs, and I've been able to train the body, and the violence that they're still attention to train their body, tons of mothers.
Then there's the driver.
After statistics of working ministerium is the city in the city of the city in the city of the city of Jobs in the country. And I learned why.
You're all day in the traffic, everything, everything.
All right, and I want to pick the cars, and they don't enough.
That's really bad for the worker.
And the mothers itself is full of Gifted the mothers, and the terrible.
I learned about the university of the mothers.
If you look from the Bordstein carry and from the back of the back of the mothers of the Mothelwagen, you see that mothers itself.
He doesn't hearing to see.
He's also like a kind of a circulation or circulation.
He's always got to be in movement.
And then there's the stigma.
You're not going to be invisible, until someone -- from whatever, because you know, because you know, because you're going to be blocked or a pause of their coffeee, or a coffeeee, or a coffeeee, and they're going to take a coffeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I think this stigma particularly ironic, because I think the city of workers, the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city.
They're the watching public health.
If they didn't remote, every day efficient and efficient, he would expective, and the treatments and the missing the treatments, and that would be recorded to us very remarkable way.
Disease that we had been since we had been since the centuries, and centuries would be sitting out of control and we'd sitting.
The economics, they need.
If we can't help the old cram, we don't have a place for the news. The motors of economy, when the consumption is breaking out of consumption.
I don't tell the capitalism, I just walking on the way.
And then that's what I call our average, number of all, all of us, all of us.
So I just like to say, how fast we're going to be able today.
We don't know about it, our coffeeeeechers, our determines or our water, or our water, or our water, or why we're going to repairs.
We take them, they're going to forget, because we know that there are people on the other side of the other side of the other side.
So I want to tell you a few way today, how we can think about city, how we can think about city and to improve the stigma, and they can make it in these difference, how to create a city and human.
Their work, I think, is kind of a lot of liture.
You see the streets every day, regularly.
They met in many cities.
You know, you know, you can expect them.
And their work is our working.
They're like a back-scale.
The moment they're on the right, they're going to be sure ourselves, ourselves, ourselves, and that are reports of our attention, and that must behavior.
At the days after the 11th, I heard the Donner of a mothers of a mothers on the street, my little son and ran out the trepping the trees and there was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who fire, and everyone was famously like everybody, he was fireed his paper
And I tried to him for his work, and I started to thank you -- at this day, but I started to finish.
And he looked at me and he said, "Alles will be good."
"All right."
I started later, I started my neighborhood and I met my neighborhood and wear the man.
His name is Paulie and we've been working on, and we've been great friends.
I wanted to believe that Pauliet.
All right.
But in our bema, the way that we need to change the way we've got to change as species, we need to do all the cost of the cost of the most human cost of the most human cost of the work.
And we need to be able to get the people who are going to do with the work that works that we can do, and how we think about how we think about how we can think about how we can think about how we can do sustainability that we can recycling our streets, which is a remarkable foresting.
Instead of cities, what we think about mothers, if we talk about mothers, three percent of the national Aballstroms.
It's a remarkable statistics.
In your eyes, in your life, in the eye, if you see the next time you see the next time you see it's going to take you to look at a moment, you're going to take a moment, they're true.
Take a moment, you're going to be thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what's going on?

But one wonder curiously, we found: Yoga.
I have to say, it's real long, but before I did before I was a stand-up company, I was a stand-up compedian,
Now, I can also stand on the head.
My parents blood blood me, I always appear to all in the country was impossible, and my dream, and my dream was, and my dreamed with Seifen Hospital Hospital Hospital Hospital Hospital Hospital Hospital Hospital Hosital H
And I got a greater of minds of minds of minds of minds of the ASU, who was a great state University because I'm setting every mind.
I was quasize the house of the challenge of challenge.
All right.
I was allowed all the house of the house, but I gotten in all my course, in all my course, in all of their course.
Every time I played a sense of "The Glasmanagery" played my teacher.
But I got never got a role.
In my book, I planted the ASU., the ASU.U.S.
A piece of a girl with CP.
I was a girl with CP.
So I said, "It's getting a role!
I have cerebralparis!
All right! end!
God's been finally finally finally free!"
I didn't get the role.
Sherry Brown.
I called the line of the challenge of the challenge, I had hysterically, when I was a little bit of my cat, and she said, she said, "You know why I wasn't hearing the stunts I wouldn't have the stunts.
I said, "If I said, "I can't see the stunts, but if I can't do it."
I was born for that role for these role for these role and they gave them a challenging cP.
The unique in the life.
Hollywood is available to get it, body knows, body's healthy schools.
After the Abluss, I went back home. My first role was as a statistin in a sea.
My dream was true.
And I knew I knew that I was called "Restaurant Fregast" to "verress."
But instead, I finally, I was a glorified massive millions that only was the back of the background, and I realized that Casting was not locker, and I realized that Casting casting swaller, ethnic, ethnic, ethnic,
They just went out of people.
But exceptions are the rule.
I grew up with Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr and Ellen, and all these women had a common: They were comics.
So I became comics.
My first Job was to be a book of comics from New York City to Shows in New York City, and I'm going to be able to drive the face of the first comics that I ever been able to forgether when he was sleeping up with the New York.
I'm in Clubs everywhere in the United States, I also made Shows in the Nahs Oast Arabic.
Some people say, I'm the first comics in the Arab world.
I don't like to call me, but I don't know they've never heard about the bad small general green green, and they're not going to be completely come to us.
In 2003, my brother from one other mother and father, Dean Obeidallah, and I'm going to be with the New Yorker American company festival, that's been done.
Our goal goal was to change the negative picture of American heart of American heart in the media and to remember the casting Casting Casting Directories and Arabia and Arabia.
The same thing that was much, much more easier than the challenge, much easier than the challenge of the mistakes.
My big during was 2010.
I became as Gast in the news of Countdown in Keith Olbermann" in Keith Olbermann"
I came to the Aball, I was talking about a studiogen, they sat me in a studio and sat down to a three-day.
So I looked at the office and said, "Ingmanager and said, "I can I get another stair?"
And she looked at me and said, "Five, four, four, four, two.
And we were live!
So I had to found myself at the table of the gast, so I didn't have to be during the screen, and when the interviewed me.
And I was my chance, and I had been tried, and I knew I knew I never had never been reporting me.
But Mr. Olberman, I didn't just repeated me to a volleagues and smaller and little bit of my stairs.
And in the work with Keith Olbermanny, I learned something like this: All people in the Internet are dirty.
People say, kids are done, but as a child or adults, no one has made me lossible.
In World Wide Web, I'm suddenly playing with my mind.
If I look at online videos, I see comments like, "It's how to look like, how does that?"
"Ey, is the getting?"
And my favorit: "Arorist Hengelippen-Terrorist.
Hat they came up ne disease?
We should be able to tell them."
One badly even before my mistakes in the credits of the Credits: Drehbooks, comics, comics, comics.
A mistake is so such as the future.
If a role-conc<unk>t example, can't play, Beyonc<unk>t a role-c<unk>soc<unk>s not a role.
The mistakes are the largest -- Ja. This is applause.
People with minds are the largest minds of the world and we're the undergrounded in the world,
The doctors said, I could never go, but I'm going to go.
But I would be able to grow up with social media, I may not be here.
I hope that we can collapse a positive positive positive education in the media and in the media.
Maybe it would be less hass in the Internet when it's more positive positive positive positive.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it needs to be a village to get a good job.
My journey has been a very special places, very special places.
I thought on the red phone called Susan Luci and the iconic Luci and the iconic Lorraine Arbus.
I thought in a movie with Adam Sandler, and with my idol, who work with my idol, who works.
I'm a mainly as a mainly with the compedy-Tour "Arabs Gone Wild" to the world.
I was representantin of the big basic basically New Jersey in Democratic National Committee 2008.
I have "Maysoon's Cids" cids, a profound verein, who trying to give you a palestinian flowers to give me a chance to give me a chance to give me.
But one moment that most of the most important -- before this -- before this -- the moment that's most of the most people who were in front of the man who was in front of the man on the man, and how a smetters, and how a bike, and how a bit of the Parkinson and how I was like a moment.
This was the only time I saw my father had a live-power of me, and I saw this talk, and I watched this talk.
: Mays God your sea, your seals, Papa. My name is Maysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon.
There was a time where we were largest problems.
At the 21st-19 smallpoc Aldrin from Molonlands from Molonlands of Molon, and standing on the sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were all own, but their opposite on the gray Molonoberflower was the highest exactly the surface.
The Apollo-Program was the largest peace-pollo-pollo-pollo-pollo-controlled states of America.
To monitor to Molon, investigated NASA investigated NASA, or four percent of the collarship, or four percent of the bundes of the bundeshouse.
Apollo, workplace for 400,000 people and he explored the collaborators, and the collaborators, companies and bodies.
People start to be the best of the Apollo 1.
But to the end of the Apollo-Programms of 24 people to Molon.
From the second, the seaface of the surface, Aldrin, after the death of Armstrong in the last year, now the old year.
But why did they went?
They didn't need much back: 380 kilogramm old faces and something that every 24 later -- a new sense of its own sense of its common home and quite small and pretty small and quite crazy.
Why did they go? As they went to see it because President Kennedy the Sowjets, the Sowjets had better rockets.
But Kennedys are empty words of 1962 at Rice University.
For age of time, Apollo not just one of the West, about the oast during the oast west.
For those of the time was the most sense of the first feeling of the Earth's sense of technology.
They floating for Molon, because it was something great.
The moonel was happened in a culis of a long-term technological triumphe.
First of the first half of the 20th century, the flyings came and the flight, Penicillin and a vacculosis.
In the middle of the century, and the polio and the polio and the pocks.
Technology seemed to have something that alvin Topler 1970, a "believement.
For the grandman history, we couldn't faster than a pounder than a pounding or a boat with seguls, but in 1969, but in 1969, the Manny of the Apollo 10,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970s, no human beings on the moon.
Nobody has ever moved to move the best way to move the best of the collo 10, and the unknown optimism is lowered by the power of technology issue to solve the big problems that we've been able to solve the technology to fuels.
I remember that I remember how I was as a five-year-old.
The seven of the Apollo 17, and my mother was not too much in the couple of the saturns out of the Saturn-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-Rake-R
I had a idea that this last monthmission, but I was hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of colonies on my life.
The expression is "etwashing with our ability to solve the skills with technology," is to solve a platform.
You hear it everywhere.
We have heard this in the last two days at TED.
It comes to a prediction of technologists, and itself with approaching playing with a player, and middle of things like iPhones and social media, or algorithms, or algorithms, the automatic business.
It's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have our lives and related our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What's happened?
There's a long explanation from the Silicon Valley, where you're going to be less earlier time, in the last time, when in the years, in the years, in the years, in the years, Microsoft, Apple and Gentech and Gentech and Gentech.
In Silicon Valley says, you would be the markets, in the Bonduld, which is the presenters, which records the company.
Silicon Valley says that Riskoinvestors have moved to move the ideas of changing ideas, and instead of understanding ideas, and instead of problems or even found problems or even found problems.
But this explanation is not good enough.
It's explained, which is not true what happens with Silicon Valley.
Even to their risks to their risks of risks of risks, small an investments with a small an exhibitions within a possibility investment in 10 years.
Investors had always been able to in technologies like energy in technologies like energy, which is a enormous evolution and the development and the development and the development is never been long and risk of the development of technologies, never have been developing technology.
No, the reasons why we can't solve solve, are complicated and deeply.
Sometimes we're not going to be conscious problems.
We could fly fly on Mars, if we want to fly.
NASA has been designed a plan.
But for Mars to fly a political decision of public decision of public board and so that's never happen.
We're not going to fly because everybody thinks that there's important things that are important things that are going to be done.
One of other time, we can't solve the big problems because our political systems.
Today, less than two percent of energy consumption of the Earth of the Earth, he remainable qualities like solar power, how solar powerful than two percent, and the reason, and the reason, and the reason for it.
Kohle and successful than solar power and wind and wind and wind and wind and winds is bill less than Biocraft.
We all want to old alternative energy quality, but it doesn't exist.
Now, it's so that evolution, companies and economics and economics in the principles of the same minds of the same practices and international practics and international practices.
But in the second political climate change, there's no hope that the energy politics of the U.S. or the international actions and again.
Sometimes are deeply problems that technological problems, but not solvable.
It was long as long as a long time, the hunger of life,
But 30 years of researchers have given us that hunger is that hungry are catastrophal effects that are catastrophal effects on the lives.
Technologies can be things like Earth or systems like Lager, like Lager, but it's going to be better, but it's going to give you approach, so long as you can give governments.
Now, large problems, sometimes the solutions, because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon, in 1971, the war, but you're going to find out that there are many ways of cancer, but you know that there are many species of cancer, most of the most of the most of the most of the most realized therapy, and he's been realized, and he's been able to doing the realized.
Swere are difficult to be difficult.
It doesn't true that we can't solve with technologies.
We can, but we have to do it, but we need to be able to be able to be able to be interested in this politicians and the public, a problem, a problem, a problem, and institutions, and we need to be able to understand its a problem.
The Apollomision that was to solve the ability to solve the ability to solve this criteria, so that he's been solved these criteria.
But this is a model that can't be repeated in the future.
It doesn't have the year 1961.
There's no dramatically three campf like the war, no politicians like John Kennedy, who has been hard to a hardy, and dangerous and dangerous and dangerous systems like the Science fictional systems like the Science fiction of the Science fiction of the Scies
But all of the mind, it was the end of the end of the end of the moon.
He was only three days.
And it's discussion whether it really serious problem.
We're on ourselves and the solutions of the future of the future.
Because God, it doesn't miss everyone else wouldn't start to challenges.
Thank you.
I want to sleep you to fly.
Imagine you're going to imagine your head.
Betray the door, their color and the material from the material.
Now, now you're going to be a group of face covered on their drivers.
It's a naked food carrying and they come up with your building and your building.
You have to imagine that really needs to imagine.
They're stuff, switching and turns out there.
And then they all should all directly in your head.
For experience, all of these cross, all of them, and sort of corporate signs.
Now, the average over the swells your wave in your wave your floor or what your flour or what your side is your walls on the other side of your wall, and just like the light.
The light is appears on the crump.
It's going to be out of a guy of a guy pounds of a guy.
Some people talk about a couple of pound.
You can feel like his blue faster how his blue fell your nose fellow.
You're called the shocokecokecoke, because it's going to be in the mouth.
Gove him, in your wall, in your wall.
Here's your idea of your performance of your imagination of your imagination.
Their kider is only the most powerful, it singingings, she singings "Hit More Time More Time," while sheether they're dance.
Now I'm going to follow me to your books.
The boden was replaced by a same powerful power and out your opened up your open, the dorothy, the dorothy, the sweet and the solution from Oz" and the solution of oz."
Okay. Now, now open the eyes.
I want to tell you about a very bizarren Wetting, which every year in the fruit of every year in New York City.
He's called "Onited States Memory Championhip.
A few years ago, I wanted took from these competition as science as science, and he expects that year ago, the year ago.
It was a bunch of guy and some few dames, from all different dames, from all different alter and Hygia.
They were presented to be a little bedded hundreds of hundreds of numbers.
Larners who have the name of dutting and usefuls of unknown.
And maybe all the memory in only few minutes.
They could concerned about who could be the range of a gemical cards of a gemical cards at the fastest one.
This is crazy.
These people have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have.
I started to look at some of them with some of them.
This is Ed Cook, a guy who is from England, and there's one of the most part of the most powerful memory.
And I asked him, "It you've gotten you notice that you've got this particular possibility?"
And Ed said, "I'm not an insula.
I just have average thought about average.
Everybody who's been done, you're going to have average or she's just average.
We all have told us to have to trained technology, and we trained these incredible memory, and technology to fully the Greeks, technology that have been five years ago. These technology that have been using the carbon.
And I thought, "Wow, how does it come to mean I never heard?"
We stood out there, weather out of the Wettkampfhall and Ed, this wonderful, and something excited to me, "Josh, you're an American type, you're a American journalist.
Can you're Britney Spears?"
I said, "What? Nee. Why?"
"I would like to bring Britney Spears, like you're going to teach the range of a gemical cards of a gemical cards.
It would be the world move that this can be here."
I said, "I'm not Britney Spears, but you could make me feel like it.
I mean, you have to start somewhere, not true?"
And that was the beginning of a very slowly for me.
A lot of the next year, I spent my thought, I didn't just trying to training, but also to understand how it works and understand how it works, and how it works why it works and what it might be working and what it might be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
I've really interesting people really interesting people.
This is the example EP.
He's sorry, and he's suffering and it has been a bad smartment of the world.
His is so bad that it's so bad that he doesn't even remember his memory. What he's amazing.
Although it was so tragic, he was a bottom of how much our memory is how much our memory is what we're going to do.
On the other side of the spectrums, I learned.
Cim Peks.
He was the prediction for Dustin Hopmans Character in the movie "Rain Man."
We spent after after afternoon, in the public books in Salt Lake City telephone in Salt Lake City telephone.
And I came back to a whole stapel Abhandles about the memory of the memory that were made by 2,000 years ago, and more than 2,000 years ago and later in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle
And I've learned a whole bunch of things.
I was fascinated to me that there was a time to train the idea that there was a time to training the idea of cultivate, not to cultivate how to cultivate how to do it today.
There was a time to people in their memory in their memory investigating, it's trying to change it.
And over the last few year, we have a series of technologies, we have a series of technologies -- from the alphabet to the codex, the photography, the photography, the photography, which is just the smartphone -- the smartphone -- the smartphone.
These technologies have changed our modern world, but in the same time.
They have changed us, and I would changed that they'd be able to changed us.
Without the need to remember the needs, sometimes it seems like this.
One of the last places where you can find people who can find people who are still last people who are still training their memory, and cultivate, and cultivate, this is a single thought of cultivate.
In fact, it's not so single, there's a competition like this on the world.
And that's what I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a research group at the University College London a group of Gedmanisms in Laborator.
They wanted to know, Is the structure or anatomy of their brains different than the rest of us?
The answer was: No.
Are they smart?
They gave them a stapel Kognition, and the answer was: Eigently not.
There was all the time, and there was a lot of interesting difference between the brain of a memory between the brain of a memory and the control.
If you put them into a fMRI machine, and you're in a brain, while they're numbers, and images of snows and images of snows, you can see that in the brain, you can see that in the brain of other regions of the brain.
It seems like they're using the part of their memory, which is used to use the rumber of the rum of reminder and navigate.
Why? And can we learn something else?
The Wettkamp fighting the best memory is going to be a kind of wettles, in every year, in every year, in every year, in every year, with a new technology to fast-footprints of more facts and the rest of the rest of the rest of the field.
This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three times more memory.
On the table of him, 36 guys are 36 guys who he's inside of a hours with a technology that he's been invented and as a single box.
He used a similar technology to make the exactly the exactly the exact same range of 40 to 140 pays in a half half hours.
Yes.
And even though there's a university to technology to decide the most things in these wettlements, but all these technology, but all these technology on the concept that psychologists called the Psychologists called "abelaborative encoding.
This is called baker<unk>Bcker<unk>Bcker Paradox illustrated this conception, it's experience, like, if I'm going to be two persons, and I say, "Man, and I say, "Merman, and I say, "Merman, you know, there's a person called a person."
This is his name.
And I say, "Merk you, I say, "Merks that there is a person who is a baker."
If I'm going to go back to a later time, and I say, "We knows you're still going to go back to you?
You know, white word about it?
The person who should be called Bakermany should be remembered with wishers, he remember the words that the word as the person who should be able to minds.
Same word, different memory, different memory, it's sort of slow.
What's going on here?
Now, the name baker covers means nothing.
He's absolutely unabled by all the memory that memory that you're in your head.
But the term of the tagers, we know bakers.
Baker comic white comic white mothers.
Baker have mistakes on their hands.
Baker range, if they come from working from work.
Maybe we're even knowing a baker.
And if we hear the word to hear that we're going to hear this approach to the word and encouraged it, the memory and recording it.
The brain that has been able to find what's going on in the memory, and that's going to be able to find the secrets to find everything, and that's better to find everything is better to find the name information.
One of the expands of technology can be 200 years, 200 years back to the antics of Greeks.
She was known as the memory.
The story is how it's going on, it's like this: There was a dichter named Simones, who was a festm named Simones.
He was for the difference, because when you wanted to change when you wanted to do a really great party, you didn't want to do a draged.
He's sounds from the memory of the memory and lose the space. In fact, and in the room. In the moment, and it starts all the guy.
Not only are all dead, their body are uncomfortable to uncomfortable.
Nobody can say who was going to say who was never been subject where who has been told.
The body can't be really certainly certainly.
It's a tragedy to the other.
Simones are out there, the only single survival survival of this catastrophe. He's suddenly began to see that he's been able to see what he's been able to see what healthy.
And so he's what he's going to be the country and leads to the tears of the tears.
In this moment understood simones, something we all know intuitive, we all know that we're all know that we're also bad news, telephone, telephone or wisdoms of our colleagues, we can think a very good visualization and risualized.
If I'm going to ask you to report the first 10 words of the story about Simones, so it would find it.
But I wanted to remember if I'd like to remember who was going to remember who was in this moment in your foyerd in your foyerd in your foyer, then you could problem the problem.
The idea of the idea of the memory is to build a building inner eye, and it's inside the eye and it with images of the pictures of things -- the bizarre, bizarre, bizarre, loss, less, less, the picture, the picture is so stronger, the picture, the
This is a rather than 2,000 years old, which is about 2,000 years old latines about the memory.
So how does it work?
You're going to take you to turn to TED to tED a talk to TED, and you want to hold it out of the memory, just like Cicero, just like Cicero, as Cicero, he would have been done in 2000 years ago.
You could imagine, you can imagine your heart.
If you're absolutely transformed and remembered story with unpreced pictures to remember that you're going to remember that you want to talk about this greatest wets.
And then you go into your house and she's the crump, and they're on the back of Mr. Ed. Ed.
And that would remember that you remember your friend Ed Cook.
And if you want Britney Spears, they're going to tell you a luster, you want to tell you a luster.
You go to your books, and the fourth of the fourth of the fourth, was that you want to talk about the same journey for a year, and you've got some friends that you help you.
So the same rest of rather than the words -- not word for words -- not word for words, but it's just because it's just topics.
The English term "topic sentence," a sentence, a sentence, comes from Greeks," which means "Stopos," which means "Stopos," which means "Stopos," which means "Stopos,"
These are surprised about the people who were talking about an interactions and rhetorics in the rhetorics.
The formulation "an first service" is actually called "An first serious sentence in your memory."
I found that all of this simple fascinating and I'm still fascinating.
And to some more memorytelled wets.
I wanted to write something longer about this subculture of completely write.
But there was a problem.
The problem that the memory of Wettks Wettks are deadly dead-time memory.
It's like a group of people who sitting there and a test.
It's already once you're going to talk about.
I'm Journalist, I need something about what it love to write about.
I know that the most exactly the most exactly things in the cave of these people, but I don't have a stuff.
So if I wanted to tell these story, I had to try to use my lage.
And so I started to learn every morning 15 to 20 minutes before I was going to learning something out of my time.
Maybe a poem or a memory or
The name from an old year, I've buying on the floor.
I had to make it funny that it makes a lot of fun.
I could never imagine that I could never imagine.
It's fun, because it's not about it because it's not about it.
You want to be better and better and better and better and better, these crazy, farmers, hopefully, hopefully and hopefully inside your eye.
I was involved me.
Here I'm going to be with my standard Gedged Gedener's settings.
A pair Ohren Ohristm and a shutter and a shutter, which was taken up to two little streets because Ables of the greatest fine of the greatest fine of the greatest fighting.
I went to the same weathered the same I had a year early best.
And I sent to me, and I shared to participate, just as a younalistic experiment.
It could be a nice epilog for my neighborhood.
The problem was that the experiment doesn't fly planned.
I won't know what's going to happen, which isn't really going to happen.
It was nice to be representative and telephone and telephone and telephone, but that wasn't what I wanted to play.
These are just tricks.
Tricks the function, because they're on some ideas about the function of our brain.
You don't have to build a memory or dirty or you've got to build a present painting from the function of your memory.
We talk about people with good at good memory, as if there was a special expensive, but that's not true.
Good memory is antrained.
We think about things better when we're going to give us.
We remember when we're engaged.
We remember, if we can remember the opportunity, why information and experiences, and experiences, how they're going to understand how they can make them in something to make them in something to us in the other way that we can remember our memory. If we're going to remember our memory.
The memory is that memory, these memorytechnology, they're all sorts of citizens.
In fact, it's not even realized citizens.
They work because they work because they work to work.
They're working on us and recording to be in a way of being in a way that we're not.
But it's not a citizens.
So things are going to be done in the memory.
And one thing I want to give you apply to give you something that I've been through EP., the man who doesn't even remember his memory, and our memory, and our memory.
How much we're already to lose our own lives, and we're going to lose our blackberry or our iPhone or our iPhone or our iPhone, and we're going to be able to relate to us? How do we're going to face that we're going to face because we're going to face? How many more face
I learned that the memory, in everyone of us, incredible capacity.
If we want to live a memory of life, we need to be able to remember the person who don't understand the person.
Thank you.
In the age of 27, I finished approaching job in the company for a strange: Ourscape.
In New Yorks in New York Cork, I was math for you.
As every teachers, I led Tests and pressing.
I gave home.
When the work, I returned back to the work, I wouldn't get nodes.
And that was the I<unk>m not the only difference between the best and bad smarts.
The I<unk>s<unk>s one of my strongest shoots were not stratosphary.
Some of my favorite kids don't really do it.
That's what I think.
What you're in the 7th. Schoolject is hard to learning: Rational numbers, Decimal numbers, the flower of a parallelogram.
But unusual is not impossible. I wasn't found that all my students could learn how all my students could learn how they work and hard enough they worked enough.
After a few years in school, I came to school, I got to the scientific constants of education for schools and learning from a perspective of the motivation of the motivation of a psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psycholog
What we measured in education is the best way, but what if you can measured in school and lives from many more ability to learn from many more ability to learn?
So I finally leave the classroom and made a type of psychologist.
I started looking at kids and adults in all kinds of ultra-like situation. I asked to undermination. I'm going to be successful and why?
My researchers and I went to West Point Military.
We tried to figure out what cadetts were trying to bring in the troops and what wouldn't.
We went to national bookstability and trying to get out and trying to get what children would come from.
We're looking at Junglehrists who worked in very difficult collaborators and asked the teachers, which would be still under the end of the schooljects and what would be there were still better at the effective of their students would improve their students would improve.
We smart partnerships with private power and asked them, which is what the conversation of their works.
And who would be money, and who would be money.
In all these different contexts of these different contexts of a matter than meanings of success.
Our it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good except, body's not I<unk>.
It was a half-controlled.
And so that's why is passion and expression and expression and expression.
It's why it's skills.
And so, by why you're going to be a future plane, not only for a week or a week or a month, but really hard to work for years, and really hard to do this plan to use this plan.
It's why is life like a marathon, not sprint.
A less time, I started to public schools in Chicago Dr.
I asked thousands of the different seconds of seconds to the problems of sustainable question, and then I was waiting about a year to see who made the a year to see who made the a year.
It turned out that kids with higher distributed to be probably probably the devices, even if I'm going to make all the ways of families like families, things like families, like families, even in fact, like families, even in the sharing tests.
So, by the way, so it doesn't just in Westpoint and in Westpoint and in the book, but also in school, especially in school, especially for children with Abrisisico.
The first thing about this is the most subject is for me that we know that the science is so little science as you know, how to build it.
Every day, I asked me to ask me, "How do we understand the distinction of children?"
How do I live a kids like this workmoral?
How did I hold them for Distances?"
The real answer: I don't know.
But what I know is that you're not a bit of its no distinction.
Our data shows that many talentiers people just don't do their handabe.
In fact, the type of behavior of our exploration, but not talent, but correlated inversation, even inversation with talent.
So the best idea that I've heard about the best idea of the trees of average of average of approach, is the solution.
This idea was in the stanford University of Carol Dweck and to develop the surprising that the ability to learn how to learn how to change itself, but it's not going to change your inside.
Dr. Dweck has gone that kids when they learn about the brain and learn how it's going to learn how it challenges and growing in variously changes, and in fact, because they don't believe that they don't believe that a permanently permanently permanently permanently perm
This growth is a great idea of half of the idea of the idea of the task of the type of during.
But we need more.
So here I want to tell my beminesses, we're so on.
This is the work that we're doing.
We need to be our best ideas and strong intuitions and we've got to do.
We need to be able to measure whether we need to be able to be able to have to learn to learn to learn and learn from prepared to learn from.
In other words: We need to give you available to give us more diversity.
Thank you.
In the center of my work is the connection of the connection of the connections of our community and part of the environments, where architecture from the natural bonds, local conditions.
Today, I have as an example of it, ....
Beide projects are in Swells, one in Ethiopia and an in Tunesia and an in Tunesia.
They also have common that the different analysis of different analyze from different perspective perspective a little bit of the final architecture.
The first example, began with a slad, a more population, a more powerful in Ethiopia's Haupthiopia's Haupt Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis.
This is the kind of buildings that we should be, and my team and I was should be designed for what we should be designed.
And first I thought I wanted to walk.
After we saw a few of these buildings -- there are many of them -- there are many of them in the city -- we realized that they have three women have three women have three women have three women.
First of all, these buildings are almost easier because they can't be a lot of large cannot lists.
Secondly, they need a lot of energy because the surface of glass, which is what Hitze inside the inner, and then you need a lot of cool.
In a city that doesn't happen to be able to happen, because they've been pretty mildings in 20 to 25 degrees.
And thirds didn't have anything with Africa and <unk>thiopia.
This is a place with a place with a place with a such culture and tradition.
And then I was in our first subjects, I was really excited by the old market with this fascinated with this fascinated selling of people, where thousands of people are hanging and a small hands.
It also has this idea of public space that the eye of the outside to create activity.
So I thought that's exactly what I really want to do is not a shopping Mall.
But the question was how we could do a more possible, two-day buildings with these principles.
The next challenge came when we got the reason when we looked at the reason, because it's in a right growth of growth, the city of the city that you see on the city that you see on the screen, not there was no one.
And it's the two parallelstreams that have no connection that have no connection.
So, when we look at an invention between these two streets, and lived there all the editors of the building.
This is what's going on in a general airt that a movie that a movie, which is a film in the buildings that are suns of self-f-foresty self-f-foot and regenerating.
So took this hohlight, we place the idea of a market with little lions that are small lions that are in every etage, because of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape.
I also think about it: How do we sleep this building?
I really wanted to find a solution that are reacting on local climate changes.
I started thinking about participate how a short of beds from Beton with perforations, which is air, and the light, but in filter form.
Then inspired me these bad caves on the clothes of the clothesiopic women.
They have the own capture of a fractal geometry and the half me to give me the entire fatade.
We build this little bit of these little bits, the windows, the airplane, and light on controlled ways in buildings.
And that's going to be through these little glaciers, and that's the light from the buildings that the buildings to experience the building.
It wasn't just the boards with these ideas of ideas, because they thought, because they thought, "That's not a shopping Mall. That's not best."
But then we all explained that these idea of the market is much profitable than the idea of a pinker than the idea of a left, because they can sell the more color.
And the concept of the concept of the fatade was much, much more important. Not only because we needed to be a climate change, but because we don't need to have a climate change.
So let's look at some costs that we use some costs that we use the project.
The first environment was to think about how we could make the building energy, how we could make the buildings that are almost determined city.
We're going to take a value bages by solar panel on the roof.
And our panels, we as a new public space as new public space with a new space with a new public space and bars that urbane Oasase.
This voice on the roofs on the roof of water to the water in the sanitarian event.
Hopefully of the next year, because we have the construction to five.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 words and in tunisks in Tunis.
So to make a big project, which was the biggest project that I had to design the city that I had to understand the city, but also the city, I had to understand the environment, and the culture.
While this analysis, I was particularly on the medina, that's the 1,000 years old structure that was included by 12 toregan, and by 12 toregan, and almost lines.
When I went back to the first step, the first step, the best steps that the first steps to create the first 12 bubble to create the first 12 barcones and others like the barcelona and in other cities like the open cities.
So we would choose some strategic points in an experience in an experience of this tore and concept of these tore and concepts of lines, and that changed the original patterns.
The last step was thinking about the cells that cells the small cells of the project, as a waiting as a woman.
What would be the best extraction in a mediterran climate change?
This is North South Aground, on the temperature between the two houseits that are going to be created and a natural distance.
So let's just think about it, is the first thing that most of the most value of the world's perfectly perfectly in these direction.
And that's the result, it's almost like a combination of an european Blocks and the Arabic city.
There's the blocks with hells and in the Earth and in the Earth.
It also also feels the local proposition that a higher distributed etails and a lower distance in the Earth.
It also also understand the concept of the tore.
The volume that has available form that self-controlled by three different women, and then we're also built in very distributed in the fourth of lights in the world. Internet in the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside.
The thing that I think, my favorite is almost the community of community, the room, who is going to be coming back from the building.
There's all the neighbors and make things like a 2-km-covering things like a 2-m-shaps, from a building.
These two examples have a common set of answer to answer.
They're in swells, in the cities that you can see the cities that you can see.
In these cities, the effecture of architecture in the architecture of the people who are local community and economic systems like the building systems like the buildings.
And so I think it's important that architecture is simple, but paying smells that architecture between the relationship between the environment and the environment and the environment and human beings.
Thank you.
I want to talk about trust and I want to remember the long minds of confusion.
They're so expecting that they're not been critical.
And there's my view, there's my view.
First of all, a mistake: trust in the back of the back, believe many.
Then a goal: We should be more trust.
And one of the process: We should be able to build the trust.
I think the mission that the target, and the goal and the targets on the wrong ideas.
I want to tell you a different story about a target, and a goal and a telling you a lot better answer to the things that are much better answer.
So first of the brain is, how do you think that trust believe that trust?
And if I really think about my actual knowledge about it: I don't know.
Maybe it has some activities in some activities or in other ways and maybe in other maybe.
Mir brain is the misery.
But I can look at the environments that are the environment that are the quality for the global for the global for the global.
Look at the minds of minds about a time, it's not much movement, it's not much evidence.
Socuse the people who became the people who became the 20 years ago, mainly Journalists and politicians, still miserally.
And the people who were very low 20 years ago, it's still very, very lowerful: Richtern, disease.
We love the other thing. We love is about the average of the average citizens of citizens.
But is that a good movement?
My course, he's clear -- memories.
What could they sun?
So they look at all the general institution of people who are being asked to be asked questions.
Do you want to politicians? Do you want teachers?
If you asked someone: Do you want to change your brain?
Do you want fish fish?
Do you're reason?
And then -- then you would ask, "Inw enough?"
And that would be a future reaction.
And if you understand the answer is, you might say, "I'm going to trust some of them, but not."
It's rational.
So we're trying to bring in our course, we're trusting to bring in different ways.
We don't go from that we don't go from every example of each other or consider in an obstitutional institutional institutional institutional institutional.
So I could say that I could say that I'd known a particular reason while I'd believe that the first classes that the first classes, but I wouldn't get the schoolbus, but I wouldn't get the schoolbus.
Maybe I know that they're not good auto free,
I'm trusting to say that my black hard friends a conversation of friends, but maybe not believe that they don't maybe a secret.
Simple.
So we know from our attacks, how different trust look like different trust, but how do we look at this knowledge, how do we think about this knowledge?
The environment of the fact that's very bad exploration about the fact that they're ignored people, because they ignored people in trustrate, because you're looking at the consumer.
Secondly, we come to goal.
The goal is to trust to trust.
And I think that's what I think is the goal.
I wouldn't go to play.
I would try to try to trust the truster, the trustrate more trust, but not.
I'm going to be able to trust the distribution of being able to trust.
And the people who were doing. B. Parnisse in the hands of a certain madoff, and then the name is what the name is different from the name, so that's what the name is, "This" -- "I'm going to do."
"More trust" is not a closely clean goal in this life.
It's airplane and to use it to be done.
And then you say, yes, okay, so what is important, so that's not trust, but it's not trust.
The trustomization of people can have appreciate of people.
And to do that, we need to do three things.
Are they completely? Are they doing? Are they send?
If we're going to be a person in the completely completely and actually find a good reason, then we have a good reason, then we have a good reason, then it's trust.
But the person, but uncomfortable, then probably not.
Some of my friends are completely completely, I wouldn't let them go down, because they're not a letter, because they're available.
I have friends who are very in their own competition, but these are trusting to use them about a little bit about it.
And I'm very frozen about that I don't have many friends that I've been able to lose, but in fact, but in fact,
If I didn't explain it.
But then we look for: we're looking forth, then we're trusting to trust.
It's the reaction.
The trustment of course, we need to have to have a little bit more difficult.
And over the last decades, we tried to try and control systems in all kinds of in all kinds of in experts and empowerments that we're doing it, their consciousness.
Many of these systems have the opposite effect.
They don't work how much important.
A homebams said to me, "This issue is that the paper is that the paper than the baby on the world."
And all of us in our public effects, in our in our insight, transformation, this problem. This problem. This is supposed to be able to make sure and globality and globality.
It's how hard people like Hebs come from their hard task by tasking them by settings.
Here's approach to each examples.
So much for the goal.
The goal is more trust, and that's going to be difficult, and that's going to be trust, and that's going to be able to be able to do, and if we want to have a different people, or if other people, or politicians, or politicians, or politicians are.
It's not just. You have to have to do it. It's not going to be reactions or half-time record.
And now, now,
This as a result of the belief of the consumption of the consumption,
Because it's definitely to build and I should be able to build.
We can do that, of course,
We can win a little bit of trusting to win.
So two people can use their trust in each other.
But lastly, it's trusted by characterized that it's going to be one of other.
You can't build this again, which others another one.
You have to give them a basis that they have to give you a trust.
So you have to be trusted.
And of course, that you can't do anyone in the normal leadership.
But you have to also have to be able to bring you that you're trusting to be trust.
How do you do that?
This is what happens every day, every day, every day, every day, the camp, example, very effective.
Here's a simple commercial example.
The laden, I buy my socks, I buy my socks, and they don't ask me.
They take back and take me back and give me the money, or a few of the socks in the same color.
This is great. I'm sure them, because they've been shown.
Darin is a important moral.
So, you're thinking about how you think about how it is a very good hand, that you're a very good handledge is that you're going to be smart.
So our goal is not very difficult to see very difficult to see very difficult.
It's relationship between using human beings, and the investment, and if the other people, and if the other people's others.
So the moral of the story is very less about trust, or more importantly, or think about a lot of minds, or increasingly, or incorrect or incorrect or incorrection, and how to be able to use and how to be able to build and how to be able to easy and how to be able to be able
Thank you.
You know, the best of the best of the films that I can look at the films that I can look.
I love it, my own love slings with my own kids with my kids, when my daughter four years old, we've been built up together.
The movie has not months, they don't left anymore.
You can see, of course, of course, of course,
So she had a good exciting, a gliteral carbon and a cleider and a cauberstably.
But if you look at this movie that film often, you know how extraordinary.
We live in the world and we live in a way of our children in a specular children in a specular industry.
But "The Zauberer of Oz" was different.
He didn't have this trend.
It has 40 years old, until this tears to this trends, with interesting -- another movie -- a different movie, in a girl, and a girl, and a girl, by a girls of the watchings of the watching.
You know where I talk about, right?
Goes.
Now there's a big difference between these two films, even more big differences between "The Zauberer of Oz" and all the films of oz, and all of the films that we're so looking at this.
First of all, there's a magic of Oz" very little violence.
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like the apeating same.
But I think, if "The Zauberer of Oz" today, who would have been produced by the magic, the cauberer said, "Torothy, you're going to be a prophead of Oz, you're going to be a proposed by Ozhead.
Benut your magical schools to create the computers to create the computers of the Wests of the Wests of the Wests."
But it doesn't happen.
Another point I think, the "The Puncture of Oz" very unique, is that the helpful and even classroom and even nevertheless and even nevertheless, and even never clearly characters are alible.
And I did the first time I was noticed when I was remember my daughter "Star Wars" was different.
At the time I had a son, I had a son.
He was at the time, he was about three years old.
He was not to this cinoa, he wasn't either. It wasn't even ever been there.
But he was the second child and he was going to be less than his sister.
So he's a, and he's sured the movie, and he's a piece of his mother, and I don't think he's not sure that he was going to understand what he was going on, but he was very sure in the sure.
And I asked me what he was going on.
Hat he was snapped that it's about mutes, maybe a couple of course?
Hat he was snapped that Luke a army to stop the government to stop the government?
Hat he was on the universe that there is only Jung in the universe, and of course, and of course, and of course, but while most cool, but while most of the time, but while they were actually cooling the heart of the medazine and a medazine.
Compare that with "The Zauberer of Oz" by 1939.
How do you bring Dorothy their film to a good end?
And by the way, they're starting with all the leadership.
This is the kind of world I love my kids, or I would love my kids -- Oz, right? -- and not in the world, in the world, which is pretty much of our world, which is pretty much of our world.
Why is there so much power -- big power -- in the movies that are for our kids, and so few maybe the same stone?
There's a lot of good literature about the impact of the images that films have been a lot of girls, and you should read this. It's very good.
But I didn't have so much about how young, like Jung, like Jung,
I know from your experience that princess that princesses can't use the squate picture that I could have to use the world to find through the world of the world's growth and jungledge and jungledge and jungry.
I think there was this moment with the first cuss, when I was really expecting that the first cuss that the Abspanning, because that the same way, right?
I've been doing my mission, I've been going to girl.
Why are you still there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are very excited to bring the best way to relationships and its birds, and there's not much space for other relationships and other rice.
It's almost as if you're a young a thin-dike animal is, and if you're better being better war.
And there's a lot of exception and I'm going to give the discusney Princesses everyone from you.
But they give a message on the boys are not the boys are not the goal to the goal.
They're fabelifting the girls, like they can use the patriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarch.
There's no idea for them.
There's also some grandiose women who are new stories for our children and so three-dimensional and wonderful hells are still wars, it's still war.
And that successful studio all the time, of course, of course, and everyone else, and every one of them, and every single one of them, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two m
Bis -- how many of you think about it -- to think about this year when they finally film "Merida -- legs of the hands of the high-hands."
I'm going to tell him all of you. He's in the Internet.
Rememember what the criticists said, "Merida"?
"Ach, I can't believe that Pixar a princess of a princess."
He's very good. Let's not going to be able to get there.
But as well as not as good as any of these films.
I don't know if you heard about it.
He didn't have so carefully and maybe we're going to be a movement, but maybe we're going to be a movement.
Alison Bechdel is a computorin and has a computorin and has been able to get this difference that they had seen this difference that they had seen with a friends that they had seen before.
It's just a simple. There's only three questions that you need more than a character in the movie, and something says, "It's a character in the female?
Try a trying to make these idea of exploration.
And talk about these women to any time to anyone else's time with each other?
And it's about their entertainments to something else than to do something else they want to possible?
Does? Thank you.
Thank you.
Two women who are existing and talking about each other,
So something happens. I saw it, and I see it, and I see it quite substantly, I'm going to know it and love.
In fact, I've been walking into Kino, took me a very good film on me a very good film.
They remember? For example, we've got great example of example, a lot of example of what approach, a good hollywood film.
He falls with white foots through the test.
I think he shouldn't think that a grandmany -- I don't know if you saw it -- but a grandman -- but a grandmany, in a message in a men and women and women areas of the men and women's hidden.
There's some good sense, in the men in this conversation in this conversation, from anxiety and the great moment, and the great moment that has one of the challenge, and say, "Come is to say, "Come on a door," and say, "Come on the bed?"
So imagine some Hollywood.
So let's go to the numbers of the numbers.
In 2011, under the 100,000 popular films, what do you think about how many of the most female mainly women?
Elf. That's not application.
It's not so many protects like the number of women that we've just been in the Congress, so that's good.
But there's a number that is the larger than that, and that's going to be.
Last year, the New York Times has a study that has a study that government has been published.
She said that.
One of five women in the United States that she was already in their lives.
I don't think that the school of all the way of all the way that is.
I don't think kids to do any children's something that they have.
I don't think that music videos and pornography and Pornography, but something that I'm going to do something that statistics, and if I think that this statistics that I think that these statistics I think that these are many sexualstractions.
Who are these guys? What do they learn?
What do they do not to learn?
Take them into the story that it's the story of a mense of a mense of a mense of violence and then the turn of violence, which is a woman who is not a woman who has no friends and not red?
Take this story?
You know, as a parents that the parents has a parent that the privileged a daughter how the people who do the same thing that we're doing this world and we want to do this world and we want to do this world and we want to do it.
We have middle to the compassion like "Met" and we hope that will help me, but I asked me, but I asked me if Mirdlower, if we're going to use our same time, actively, actively, their sons, their sons, their sons, their sonsibilities.
The Netflix wart is a middle of a middle that we can do something very important to do with the voice.
I think we need to be a new sons of simple simple simple village.
The definition of men's already to change yourself.
They've been reading how the New Economy the role of house and breaks of house.
They're going to be created by each other.
Our sons are going to find a way to find a way to relationship, a new relationship with each other, and I think we need to show them that someone who really wants to show them that someone who wants to be a real man who wants to be a sister and they want to be respect and they're going to be respect and they'recue to be respect
I think we should say, "Wart with the netflix watching for films that are going to find the tests, and if we can find them, and look for the heldines that are going to take the real mutes that are going to bring together and our sons that are going to bring our sons and our sons and our senses.
When I asked my daughter who said, who was their loved in "Star Wars" since, what they said?
Obi-Wan.
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
What have these two common?
Maybe it's not just the gliteral cleider.
I think these two figures are experts.
These are the two characters in the movie that are more than all the other and their knowledge and their knowledge with other people, to help them to help them to help them.
They're leaders are leaders.
If I found this kind of a job for my daughter and give me the kind of air, and I found this kind of air.
I want to make more tasks like this.
I want to be less assumption, in my son, and I said, "The Sonhat and carefully," and more tasks to be able to help you to help a team of a team that will be a team of a woman, and help people will help people to help people better, and help people will help people to help people
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about the story of a clinstades.
I don't know his name, but his name, but his story.
He lives in a small village in the south of Somalias.
His definitely, in the narrative.
The doorrectors of the poverty and the poverty and the village of the village.
When there was no longer what he was there, he was sitting in the city, and he went into the city, Mogadi, Mogadian, Mogadias.
When he's notice there, there's no way to do not a way, no evidence.
It's the end of the end of Mogadian exception of Mogadian.
It may be a year, but nothing.
One day he's going to be a man who's going to be a managed to the middle, then the magic, then for the same thing.
He triffs this dynamic group of young people and give them a chance.
He's a little money to buy new clebration to buy new clothes and to be cutting money.
You'll be asked this young woman.
Finally, he's been involved.
He starts a new life.
His life has a sense.
One day in Mogadian, under a single himself in Mogadian Himelmels in the air.
This cleinstades with grandforestadties was the same was the self-moddown and bombs and these dynamic groups of people were older people who was old-shabaaba, a terrorganization with connections.
How could the story of a clinstad city of a clinstad that just trying to use in the grandforest city, that he was going to be in the air.
He had been made.
He had been waiting for a opportunity, on the future, and it was the first opportunity that he was the first opportunity.
It was the first thing that was going out of a state that we call "Waithood" we call "Waithood"
And his story again, again, again, again, over and over again,
It's the story of the story of working, working on Johannesburg and London Unructed in Johannesburg and London Unructed and after something else.
Now, people are talking about the city, from their city, from their grandfits, possibilities, but young people have no ants, but young people have no ants at the wealth.
Ofter all, it's the young working under the high works.
In 2030, three0, three of five-year-olds in the cities of the cities.
If we don't know people in the growth of the cities when we don't have a way to use them, "Waithood", the onestiest of the terrorism, the terrorism, in the violence 20 miles.
In my birthds, Mogadian, Mogadian, living 70 percent of young people under work.
70 percent of work, don't go to school.
They don't do it.
Last months, I'm going to give you after Madina Crankshouse, and I went to Madina Cranks, where I was born.
I remember how I was going to be in this center of hospital, and I asked me what would never be from here?
What if I was to do when I was going to be the same state of the same?
Who I was won't worry?
I'm not sure what I should say.
The reason for my attention to my at Mogadian was actually the extraction of a gift of a gift for young firement and entrepreneurs.
I brought 90s, I need together.
We sat down together and made a brainstorming for solutions for the largest challenges of their city.
In the room was a young man, Adence.
He was the university in Mogadiu and made his applusion.
There was no way and no ways and no way.
I remember how he was told me that he had an university, who was working on a university, and frustrated goal, the perfect goal, members of old-Shaba and other terrorganizations.
They looked at people like him.
But this story is a different sell.
In Mogadianu are the largest hinds to get from A to B.
In 23 years, the citizens have the street system, so that the motorcycle of the motorcycle.
Aden he realized the opportunity and he explore them.
He opened a motorcycle.
He started to motorries in place, motorries that they couldn't afford themselves.
With the help of his family and friends, he buy 10 motorries and he was sort of its business, his business in the next three years.
How do you under this story of the other?
What does the difference?
I think it's his ability to see a new opportunity to see a new opportunity and use it.
It's the entrepreneurs, and I think the entrepreneurs that we can be called "Waithood".
It's the young people who are looking at economic chances that they're looking at social channel.
You can bring people to be able to be able to be business.
I want to talk to you about a young man who's part of my metings, who was participant Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamedohamed Mohamed Mo
He helped me to tell the entrepreneurs of people who are participants that are participate and show them how to show them innovative and entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs.
He's actually the first florist, the first florist, the Mogadian, and until 22 years ago, before Mohamed, before Mohamed, you know, you've been able to get the perfectly when you wanted to be the perfectly when you want to have a flower.
If you asked someone said, "When hope you've seen the last time?" And then the answer?" And then the answer of many, the answer of the citizens, "No."
So Mohamed a medium.
He was a landscape of a country with blooms.
He lived a plantage exception of Mogadian and started to switch and lilies, which said, what he said, in the raw Klimate Mogadus, in the raw Klimate Mogadian.
He started to flying high-footing private genders, and he was working around the city and stories around the city and worked around the city of the first public public public public parks in Moguaduitude 22 years.
There's no public parks in Mogadian.
He wants to build a place where families and young people come together and how he says that can be enjoy.
Just as the rock is not a rocket, because they need to have a lot of water because they need to have too much water.
So the first step is young people inspired people inspired, and in this room had Mohameds of great effects on the other young people in the room.
They never really had never thought about a company.
They thought about it, for a NGO, or for the government, but this story, his innovation, his innovation, they had a strong surface.
He was asked her city as a place of the possibilities.
He certainly, she can be able to be able to be able to be able to bring the change.
And at the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges of their city.
They had not been unpreced by local problems.
The inspiration young people and the ship of a company of a company, but young people need to need capital, but young people need to use their ideas to use their ideas.
They need things to do is to develop and support them to develop them to develop their business and start to start their business.
Bring people with the resources that they need to be able to use them in connection, you need the difference that they need to use the difference that they need to use ideas to use ideas and you'll be catalys for strong.
For means that means more than just the business of a business.
It's about the effects social effects.
Mohamed doesn't just selling blumbs.
I think he's buying hope.
His such as "Free peace," is going to be created when he's changed by people on their city.
Aden streets have been able to help him that help him to help him the motorries and instanding.
He gave them the chance of the chance of the late condition of the "Waithood" to come from the "Waithood"
These young companies have a enormous expect on their cities.
So my prediction is: Mach people young people, young people, and young people, and you'll leave their own innovations and you'll get more stories about blumbs and "Free-driving automob and "Waith Wood."
Thank you.
While my childhood in Maine was one of my favorite businesses, after Sanddollars, because my parents of Maine, because my parents's bringing happiness.
But these muscles are hard to find.
They're from Sand to see, cave.
But after a while I had a routine.
I started looking at figure, and patterns that I helped me to sammar.
The developed to find a passion to find things to find things to be able to find a love for past and the archology.
And when I started to studyptologyptologyptology, I realized that the same thing with my blocks with my blocks.
Because suddenly, in Egypt in Egypt in Maine, my little street in Maine, athundamental miles, and my sands of the nils. And my sanddollars.
And that led me to use satellite pictures.
I had to see differently, to see the past, to make the past.
I want to show you how we're going to see infraroting differently when we use infrarots.
This is a piece that's a possible egyptical dolphins.
And the piece of course, we need to use it. Ben using infrarot, and we're working with false, it's going to be suddenly hellrosa.
What you see here is the chemical chemical chemical chemicals of the country and --activities and -- activities.
What I want to share with you today is how we used satellites to find a old-gyptical city to find an oldestyptical city, and for thousands of years.
It's the mainstadian was the mainstad of the alten <unk>gypte, more than fourth century, in a hundred years ago.
The pastic is in the Egyptical al-Fayyptic al-Fayyum and it's very big room, because it's a big rocketic architecture and religion.
<unk>gyptologen would always know that the state of It's always been sort of pyramid in the name of the pyramids of the pyramid, but somewhere in this rod circle, but somewhere in this massive switch.
This is huge -- the small -- the flowerful -- the flower.
Fromly floating the nil is directly in Its Jewish, and while his city, and while he was surveyed the city of the city.
So how you find a large city in a city in one of the city.
They're going to find out what the qualent of the qualent of the city in the home in the home of the homeball and baseball-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand
So we used NASAs Typographs Typographs to see a map of the country to see through change.
where the sun of the nils early.
But you see exactly, and that's very interesting, this easy, this easy, attacked with the circle that we're looking at the city for the city for the city for the city.
So we're working with egyptical scientists together with hoalf-controlled by what you can see here.
This is how Hoelcohren in the ice, just instead of the signs that climate change, you look at the human records that human recordings.
In a deep of five meters, under a thick snowled slightly, we found a distance from Tonish.
This shows that in this position for It's position for It's five meters, we can find a more hundred years, we can find a little bit more hundred years, back to the exactly to the exactly the exacts of expects that we're going to be expecting existence.
We found outside Werkstein -- cartoon -- cartoon, <unk>uart and Achat -- what's going to work.
It may not be a lot of, but if you look at the most powerful sentence that were used by Juwelize that were used to use this set of juice.
So we found a distance of the exhibition of this state that statement to the middle of this piece.
We also found a juwelize for a juwel society, which is a very important city that this is a very important city.
It doesn't even have anyone there anyone else, but we're going to return to this state to show you a map of map.
What's important is that we're going to be services for youngypters that are going to be in the satellite technology that they can do the genoices that are explorations.
So I wanted to my favorite single-scaled out of the Middle English -- it was in the city of It was founded by It's been written by the city.
"You know, is the biggest of all the biggest expects.
There's nothing the same in the country."
TED wasn't in 1984. Christ. Christ.
But I think that began to have been in 1984, but in 1984, in a long time, in a long long long-term.
And that you can look at the mushrooms at the streets of the road.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I grew up in Taiwan as Taiwan as a case of my beautiful exements, like my mother's personality, like my mother's personality and the form of Chinese significant signs.
Sither I was from this incredible language.
But for a outside, it seems like this, it seems like the grandman of China.
In the last years, I asked me how I could have this master, so that everyone can do this, so everyone who has to understand this complex language, and then they learned.
I thought that a new fast method, Chinese method, Chinese, Chinese.
I learned about five. I learned every single strange for every single strange in the right each stripes in the right eye.
In the next 15 years, I learned every day, I learned every day.
So we just five minutes to have five minutes, and just a quickly and simple methods.
A Chinese area, a chinese leadership. 20,000 signs.
They just need 1,000 signs for a simple simple simple simple simple simple simple.
The most important 200 percent of you, 40 percent of the simple literature -- enough to understand streets, specting spects and the reason or time.
Today, I start with eight signs to show you how the methods works.
Are you ready?
"You know, your mouth, as possible, until he's possible.
That's called "Mouth."
This human beings are talking about.
"Man".
If the environment for "Fewers" a humans with high arms, when he would be service, "Hilf!" I'm going to live!"
This is a tree.
"Baum."
This is a "Berg."
The Sunne."
The "Mond."
The shorts for "Tures" it looks like a saloont of the Wilden West.
These eight ships are radicals.
They're the reason to make a variety of signs.
A human.
If someone looks like, it means it means "fter it means "fold."
Are there more, then it mean two "Beglegledge and three people."
When a human army, then one of the human: "It was so 'grown."
The human being in the mouth, he's like eing.
He's a "Gefangener," as Jonas in the Wal.
A bate is a tree. Two tree tree trees for a "What are for a "Weld."
Three together for a "Wald"
Set me a planke under the tree and you have a "Basis."
So let's take a mouth, you know, it means "idiotic.
Simple, because a simple baum, it's kind of idiotic.
Rememember that fire?
Two flights are already meanings called "hey"
Three fire fireed many "Flames."
Set means that fire the fire, it means "bren"
For us, the sun is the sun.
Two suns together, "the-have."
Three-funks are "Funk."
If the sun and the moon and the moon, it seems together.
In the next day, it can also be the next day.
The sun is about the Horizont: Suns.
To. A bread is in the door is for the door.
Platzing a mouth in the door, it means "Fray."
Clopf, clip. Is someone else?
This person is bad out of the door. "flow."
Links is the "Fraw."
Two women together for a "Streit."
To three women: that means "It's called "It."
We've got 30 shorts of course.
With this method, you can bring out of the first eight radical three words.
The next group of eight signs with eight signs together 32 words.
With a little bit of a little bit of a few hundred scripts, like a few hundred school chines Chinese child.
If we can start these scripts, we can start together.
For example, he's legs and fire and fire, so a "Vulkan."
We know Japan is the country of the country.
This is the sun, the Sun's sun, because Japan <unk> Japan <unk>una.
A sun with the original conversation with the enrigation.
A human behind Japan?
Aen Japanese.
The scripts are two books are two books are two books.
In the classical Chinese Chinese means "Exil" because Chinese caiser, because Chinese fine in Exily,
Today, "Exil" today,"
A mouth that says where it's going to be in the "Ausgang."
This is the following me to remember that books. Thank you. Thank you.
