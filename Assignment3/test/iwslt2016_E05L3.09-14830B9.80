When I was in my 20s, I had my first psychology psychology.
I was Doctorandin and study clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
When Alex in the first situation, she came out of the first tope and a culture of Top. They figured the sophisticated touching their sandales of their sandales of men.
And when I heard that I was similar.
My commilitoninonins were a breast patient than first patients.
And I got a woman in the 20s who wanted to talk about Jewish.
I wrote myself, I thought.
But I didn't get it.
With the lust stories that creates with the situation, it was easy to take me to take the head of the head, while we're going to take the problems.
"30 is the new 20," said, Alex and I could have appreciate that she had a right.
working later, he came back, he came back, kids later, even the death, even the death.
People in the 20s, and I didn't have time.
But I'd believed my bedroke, Alex's Liebes in question.
I think I'm going to be there.
I said, "Yes, she's trying to make men in their nive, they're going to be sleep, but it's not going to be him."
And there was my beduer: "Never, but maybe they're going to be the next.
And the best time, the best time to work on Alex's Elex's revor it."
That's what psychologists called aha-Moment.
That was the moment that I was conscious that 30, not the new 20.
Yes, people are later, people are never been never been sure than the early 20 percent of the development of 20 percent of the development.
That made Alex's 20er to the optimal development and we sat down there and we're going to sat down there.
And so I realized that these kind of harmless variety of hards a first problem with real consequences of problem with real consequences, but it was just for Alex and their love, but for the carrating cards and families.
And there's a time, there are in the United States 50 million people in the 20s.
We talk about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent of the population, if you're not the results, without the 20s without the 20s.
Meldet me if you're going to be in your eurs.
I want to see a few of you.
Oh, yeah! You're all incredibly.
If you're working with someone in the 20s, a love in the 20s, I want to lose 20s, I want to see you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
My special is that people are in the 20s, because I think that everyone can do anyone who I think everyone knows that everyone knows what psychologists, neurologists and fears, neurologists and fears, neurologists, and the most important.
This is not my opinion. That's the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the present moments, in the time to 355.
That means that 8 of 10 decisions, and Aha-a-Eres and Aha-Erlebances that are doing what it's going to do is, until their middle.
With not panish, if you're about 40 seid.
This group is going to be good, I think it's good.
We know that the first 10 years of a boy of a terms of a exponential effects, how much money.
We know that with 30 more than the half of Americans is or with the Americans or with the future of parts or a relationship or a relationship.
We know that the brain is the second and last big growth in the 20s, and it's been able to recognize whatever you want to change whatever you want to change whatever you want to do is to do is to do that.
We know that the personality of the 20s, as the 20s percent of the 20s, and that the fears in life and that the fear of women with 28, and that the women with 285 things that complicated and that complicated.
So in the 20s should be further about the body and the own possibilities.
If we think about the development of a child, we all know that the first 5 years for language and binds and binds are decision in the brain.
It's time in the same time, all of the same life, all over affective influence.
But we hear about it, we're thinking about how expective development and our 20s, and our 20s, and our 20s areas of time.
But that's what people don't know about 20s.
The present is talking about time, the performance of the result of the result.
You know, scientists called the 20er of a longer pubert.
Journalists think about the spider of spitnames for people in the 20s," or "Twixters" or "Cults" or "Cind-cind-cind-cind-cind-cind-cind-cind-cind-conists."
That's what's true.
As a culture we have the trivialized what's going to do is the result of decade.
Leonard Bernstein, my big things with a plan and something to be a plan and something to be a little time.
Doesn't it?
So what happens when you're going to happen in the 20s, and says, "You know, you know, "You know," to make something out of your life?
Garn't do anything.
This human is the human is the disease and the disease, and it's nothing happened.
And so every day intelligence, interesting people in the 20s, people like their person or how else your skills and saying, "I know, I know, I know, "I know, I don't know, but I don't know, but I don't be good time."
Or they say, "All, I've been doing it with 30 years, my career, my career, my career."
But later, it's like, "My 20s are almost 20s are almost 20s.
I had a better life, when I was a better than I had the university."
And then it's like this, "In't hearing my 20s, Partners like the risk.
All love and they had spoke, but then the music, and then the music place, and everybody fing out, and everybody fing out.
I didn't want to be the only one that I think you've been staying my man, I think I've been in my husband, because he was in my 30s."
Where are the people in the 20s?
Don't do that.
Okay, this is the second, but doesn't make a lot of mistakes, because it's about very much.
If you're going to be over 30s, there's a huge pressure, in the 30s, a career, a career, a city of a city, a partner and two or three children and two children in a lot of time.
Many of these things are incompatible and how female is just showing you just show you just a little bit more than that's just so much in the 30s.
The post-Millions-millions midlife crisisism, not sure a rod sport of red laws.
It means that you can do the career that you can do that.
First, you can't have this children don't want to give you a story, or the kids.
A lot of people in the 30s and 40s and 40s and say, "What do I have done my 20s, what I did I do I do? What did I do I do you do?"
I want to change what people do in the 20s and think about 20s and thinking about 20s.
This is a story that shows how it can draw it can be able to buy it.
It's the story of Ema.
Ema came in my bread, when she was 25, because she was like she was like she had a identity.
She said she would like to work in the business artifaction or in the enterment, but they would have not decided to be able to have a decided in the past years.
Because the billiger was lived with their friends, who was more his friends than his demperament than his embitions.
And even though their 20s, their 20s were still, their years before.
She winte in the situations, but then she sit down and said, "This can't look like, "This can't look at your friends."
A day, a day, Ema very nobody, and I got the whole starts and fast the whole stood.
She had a morning book and she spent the whole morning the whole morning their contacte, but then they start to the same thing that they were struggled to the words that brought, "Imoth. They're going to be bringing the word."
She was almost hysteric, and she said, "Who will be a car, if I've been a cars?
Who will try to be trying to me?
In the moment, I had to say, "I don't have to say, "It."
But Ema needs no therape, the really care of them, really to make them.
Ema needed a better life and I knew that was their chance.
I had been since my first patients at many of them too much of it, just too much like Emmash, like Emmashion in the waves in Wote.
In the next weeks and months, I went to three roads that every 20-year-olds, whether Mann or woman or woman, whether you should hearing.
First, I didn't tell Emma, she had no identity, they would have a lot of immediately, they're a lot of identity.
And I thought, they would look at something that they would look at the further.
Powerful for you, a investment is investment investment in something that you want to be.
I didn't know about emasy to record and no white, and no white the future of work, but I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, Identity is identity.
So now the time for this international job, this practicum, this practices that trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try this practic.
I don't smart the discovery of the 20s, but the 20er, but the quickly, the early, the early not decovery.
That's procastination.
I said to Ema: He's the work of work, but what do you do.
Secondly, I said, the urban Sippeared.
Good friends are primate to get to the airplane, but 20er who are sticking on each other, but 20s that they're going to know how to recognize what they're doing, what they're doing.
This new eventually, these new person to the new person to the person to the own environment of the own environment.
New things like this. "The Book," "The Book," so from friends of friends.
It's true: The half of 20s is underground or not business.
But the other hand is not and it's not swaughters, they've been there.
The half of Jobs are never been decided by the jobs. So if you could be the carbon neighborhood, he wasn't get away from her job.
That's not a bed. That's not connection.
The last Rat: Ema believed that you couldn't look like the family, but the friends.
This is the stimular for her as they were once, but when 20er would be bald their own family family, if they looked at a partner of the family family family.
I said, a new family from a new family, which is now.
You might think it's going to think it's about 30 better than 20 or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two, and I stimulate.
But anyone who you're sleep or lives or lives, in your life, if everyone in your life on Facebook, if everyone's not a research.
The best time to plane, is to plane, before their habit, and that means that means to be exactly the same way to be in the love in the love.
Eurur family from the family, remember, and that's what you want to do, and not because it works, and not because it works with anyone who's going to be a great time, the time you've been explained.
So what happened with ema?
We went to their edress book, and they found the middle of a cousine, who worked in a moment in a museum.
This is awake band half their hand, you're going to get a work.
This works on their works for their friends, their friends, their friends with the friends.
Now, five years later, it's Event publaner for Muse.
She's a man whole man who has been taken.
They loved their new career and their new family and their new family and she sands, "You's the cards: "You know, you're not enough."
Emas story is sounded as if it's all simple. But that's what I love on 20-year-old.
It's so easy to help them.
In 20-year-old flights are like starting the airplane, and somewhere, and somewhere in the airplane.
After the start can make a little bit of course, whether you're going to make in Alaska or in Fida or in Fida or in Fidden.
The same thing for 21-year-old for 21, 25-year-old, a good face, a great dead, a great enormous tEDTalk can be a enormous expection of years, and even more about years.
This is a idea that all 20s should be reached to their care.
It's like this, how I said to Alex.
I have the privileg, these 20s like Ema, like Ema, which is not the 30s are not the new 20s, so that's not the news, so he's a identity, you're using yourself.
Defined you don't think about what you didn't know what you didn't have done.
You decided to be over there, now about your life.
Thank you very much.
In the whole computer story, it was always our country, because the America and digital information between our physics, the louth between our physics and the world in the world, where we can record our image.
And this is smaller, little little, little little, and always smaller than a billion than a billion than a billion, the Dickey, the Dickey, and computers are reachable for everyone.
But I was asked me how it would be affecting if it's not a guys.
I've been looking like this.
First, I've developed this tools, which is a digital world in the digital world, so if you strong the picture, it's the physics.
The designers can be done so directly in 3D materializing and chirtual organizing the picture organizing the screen.
So this water, the guard was the guard.
But our hands are still still behavior of the image.
How can we interact with the digital information with the digital information and there are the whole stories?
In Microsoft Apples, I've been together with my mentor Cati Boulanger, the computer, the computer, and a little room, and a little space about the tiny in a digital work.
And so, a transparenter parenter of the picture and type of fingers and light combined by fingers and lights, you can be high-footing the task of Task and Pixelixel and Pixel.
There's a position and date a position in fact, you can actually have affective space, you can actually make a book of a regal.
And then you can book through this book and you can market and walking through the virtual touch, and all of the virtual touches.
Architects can be directly directly with their hands and redes.
So in these two example, we're going to be in the digital world.
But how do we do that when we put the ganze the ganze and the digital information stattle information?
And so many of you have a lot of you have been doing a lot of young, kind of audience and later.
But now you have to do anything about it.
Here I have a "Online-Augs,"
These sightly, you're going through a popular or through a copful or through the system, if the system, the system of our body.
These idea of your idea, I started thinking about it, I started thinking about the pixels, but they can't just physically make physically physically, and we can feel it.
How would a such a such future?
In MIT MIT Media Laby Labi Ishi Ishi and my member, and my member, a real post, a real post, a real post, a real post,
Now, in this case, in this case, this rounds like a three times like a three-dimensional Pixel in our world. That means that sowoke Computer than that people can move this objective, in this smaller.
We have the effective we have the skully and control the movement, by magnetic levitation, most of the magnetic levels and these experience technologies.
Indeed the object, we're programming it, we're going to be able to record the rumb and time, and time, and time, and time, and then we're going to be able to be able to record the real world.
So, you can be turned out. Choreographs, or michael Jordans, or Michael Jordans, and again and again and again and again.
Looks can use this, to use this complex conception and physics like planet and physics, and other than computers, and other than computers, and other textbooks or textbooks, and you can reach the experience and experience, and you can feel very emotion, and you can feel and you'ting.
And even more than just as just as just what we've been doing is to materializing, it's going to make it, how the programming the programming the world's even change our developing world.
As you can't be digital information, but not just showing us something that's not just to interact with us, as part of our physics, as part of our physics, without our physics.
Today, we've been talking about the border, but if we talk about the border, but if we're going to be a single gender.
Thank you very much.
I was two years long, I was trained to become a turiny, China, China, China, China,
When I was in the first class, I wanted to a school for a school for Athle for Athle for Athle East, all the uncovery.
But my mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to be inside as they wanted to be.
After they had the culture of culture, they were able to believe that the only way to believe that the only way to go back to the single way to the same jobi.
It's not important, whether I don't.
But my dream was to be a chinese open-perned.
That's what I'm like to talk about my claved on my claved.
A settledge, very early early early with the Acrobatics. So I've trying to go into the opening in the open.
I wrote even wrote the school and studirector and starting to the moderator of a radioshow.
But the results of models my idea.
The results are not that it wasn't think it wasn't explained.
And my friends under the friends, but they were just kids, just children, just like I'd being myself.
And with 15 years, I knew that I was to old, to still with the training.
So my dream would never be true.
I had an amazing that I could only be a lucky of my life, just a lucky for the second choice.
But that's so unexpected.
So I had to find a different population, another box.
No one of them to live me something? All right? All right?
So I went to books.
I was stilling my hand, I was after that I have a slightly about a service and musicians. <unk>"<unk>BI wrote the family of Family." I found my image in a unables.
<unk>"Sanmaos Law" <unk> <unk>"Le working the story of Nan Huaijin<unk> 1995, and what I was in the U.S. And what I've been doing?
Of course, the in China are connecting in China.
"The Good explored" is the Chinese books.
The eventually, it's not simple as a propaganda.
The bible is interesting, but it's interesting.
But that's a thema for a different mal.
But the five buildings me a kind of experience: "You should you be your father and your father and your mother."
"It," I thought, "das's so different than brain."
That was my way to make me about my way to focused me by the focus, and the relationship to my parents and the parents.
And by the reason of a new culture, I started with a new culture.
This is while many involved.
I found this cards this cards, I don't really important to be smart, because Chinese sweatch with this here.
It was never came to me that China didn't have to be in the centrum of the world.
So one cards says something about the personal sightly.
That's the same les is nothing news.
In the Academic world is a standard-food-food-food.
There are even farming researchers like conservation and conservation and conservation and conservation.
Compare and opportunity to make a complexer process of a complexity.
So I thought if I thought, if you work in the research, why not in the terms of life?
So I started two books, two books.
They can be smart -- <unk>"Benjamin Franklin Franklin Franklin" from Daacson<unk> <unk>John Adams" from David McCully, or free-dime memory, or family.
<unk>"We're going to be a catharine Graham<unk>" Warren's like a bubble -- that's life like a shock of alice." I'm also trying to be same stories in different grade.
And in Christus were the trials of economic and spiritual nature.
Buddha, they were all psychological nature: Lust, French and social psychological plants -- interesting.
If you're a friends, you make a funny, it's also funny in two language in two languages.
<unk>"Sinfony for a seavogel" from Thomas Merton<unk> <unk>Der Lune -- the life -- the life of the Taoism" of Alan Watts<unk> Ants<unk> Antatt's instead of the translate of the translate.
And by the way, I think, for example, for example, that "Gluck" in Chinese written in Chinese writing "The Freude."
"Braut" in Chinese means "The Mother's talking about "ney Mother." Ohohoh. Ohoho.
Books are like a magic tor. And they've been a magic transportation and opportunity and opportunity.
I don't know that I never felt a little more or makes a little bit more.
A course, a quite trees are nothing in the same thing that many other,
I'm not going to be able to be able to be the only couple of a trees of a trees.
His importantly, it's important to us with the mountain where the transformation, where our passion and our passion and our passion and our lucky and our lucky.
Even a couple of dream can record this currently.
Because I'm here today, I think, back today, again, and with a smart bubbling, most of the time.
Millions of being with you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
When I was 8 years old, a new girls in the class, and she was so impression, and she was so possible.
She had longer global Haar and a little bit of a small box, was good in Geography and in present.
In some school school, I was a should read you to an expective planel of planet.
So I fly on a day, I was a little longer in school, and he gave me in the middle of money.
When the air, I was came out, I got took me in classroom and numbers and noved me the note from the teacher.
And then I did.
If you're going to take the noten my rivalin, just some of the only one,
All of a service.
When I wanted to wanted to me that some of my other classroom, I also had a good nodledge nodes.
So I realized in the eifye, I've all noten all noved all novation.
I gave all fours and myself, I was also approached the whole time I was also the whole time.
I'm still used to be able to behavior.
I don't understand where the thought of the memory.
I don't understand why I've been so good for it.
I felt really good.
I don't understand why I never been never been done.
It was so obvious.
I never been taken.
But most of the most important thing: Why did it, why I was so much that this little girls so good at the books?
Eife is remained me.
It's so much about this, so deeply, so deeply.
We know that babies are living in the babies.
Even as Primates. Huttings are from nature of nature,
We know that eifying the main of the main carry for Mord,
But I never had never been a study who had told her intention, their long-term or their cabies or their cabies.
And we need to be able to read the literature, because the Roman is the labor, in the labor, in all their own forems of their own forems.
Is it a surprising to say that if we didn't have any eifye, we would have no literature?
So no untretretary, no "Odyssee"
No effortant cool, no, no, no "Aven't have "Aven night."
No Shakespeare.
And there's the lesistence of the USS. six-Schulen, because we lose, "Sall and Wahn," "Fiesta," "Fiesta," "Madam Bovy," "Madamine Carina.
No eifying, no proust. I know that it's in Mode is to say that proust the answer is that proust the answer to all the answer is really.
This year, we've been doing this 200. Jubilary masters, "An the Sook of the sook," and his green time" and his greenery of the same eventually, and the normal eventually, and we can have my hope.
Do we think about proust, think we think about prouds. Stimes?
We think about the little boys who trying to sleep.
We think about a piece of course, in Lavendel-Teeeep.
We're sending how rarely his vision was.
We're service how it's experience.
These kind of books are for virginia Woolfulf so catch.
I don't know how catzing catch is a pressure, but we're a pressure.
Let's look at why the rooman and the eifye and the eifye and proust so well, and proust so well.
Is it so obvious that eifying eifying, reduced on person -- Hinders -- Hinders -- Hinds is a fundamental for a story?
I don't know. I think it's just hard to be simple, because you think about what happens when we think about what happens when we're effort.
If we're really careful, we're going to tell us a story.
Tell us ourselves stories about life and they do it, and they're going to make us, because they're so conciples that it's so bad.
As a single of the story and the audience and the audience, what they need to start the message in the message in the room.
Eife is all about Amateur Roman skin, and so that can be prousts.
And I first band, "In Swanns world," in the Roman-Rewann, Swann, who's a protagonists, because it's very love and how they're in the beds, and suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly, so they're a smart.
Everything they're going to tell me what I could also be a little bit more else, maybe somebody else, maybe even in this moment."
This is the story that he tells the story, and from there, and from there, the proust that Swannel every new reized that he's going to be in his money to be in his private in his private in his private.
We need to be swannot being swann and proustically effective.
Prousts friends, the country, if they want to make them with him, if they want to make them.
But you don't have to be a singleeply to be a single work. It's hard work. Stim?
Eifying is experience.
It's a hungry, it's just to be during the same thing.
What do you may be the piful?
Eife magic information.
Eife magails.
Eife maybe longer global Haar and little numbers of harm.
Eife magnitive photos.
So this is also the instagram, so he's also successful.
In the reason is connecting proust the language and the science and the eify.
If Swanners are suddenly support of the door, place, and the door and the door and the device and the device of his behavior.
He says, "The maybe that the abstove is nothing, but it's nothing else, antics, or a distributed or a distinction."
He says, "It's scientific difference intellectual value."
Proust us to show you that eifying eifying is impossible and old us, but in their older, but in their career, it's after knowledge, and what's the truth, and what painful truth, and what painting.
Cummer, distribution, the person -- that's the way to proust the way.
He says, "I'm going to have the same we need to read us to make us a bigger and bigger and bigger, and breaking us as the general spectrum of a man whole man who's interested in the greater."
Sages us about this, we're going to look at this?
No. I think he's trying to tell us that eifying us something about ourselves.
Is there's another sense that we're going to make us?
Enthers are some else else emotion, our effortion, our efficient efficient and our efficient and our anspression?
Let's kind of emotional feeling with solutions?
Fromudience should be write about it.
One day, Freudience was a very best young man on the thought of the thought of the thought it was that him,
And Freudience says, this man is kind of man is kind of a woman, because he doesn't even getting what his wife.
Because they're unusual, and everyone knows.
The poor creature is losing basically different.
Instead, he looked for Dinging the wife, without the wife, so it's not independent behavior.
Are they're going to be very or strong with a manufacturing with a man?
<unk>Freud<unk>s saying that the man to the man to the house of the difference.
The Roman is very good in this point.
The Roman basically, very well, like eventually, but not enough, but not just intensive, but not enough.
Because young, we're more quite, you're going to be able to fantasia.
So I think that eifying eifying us to do not to do anything or illegal things.
Eifying us to be very slightly, very experience.
And I think I've been starting with 8 years, but I think I've heard about the story that I've heard in the neighborhood.
A five-year-old woman was fold, because they were false because they were false false falsecountry, a year-count of false, written a year, written.
All year.
They tried to try to write their extremely friends in school, and I'd like to listen to the school, I'd hearing with reaction.
Because. Let's being used to be.
What if you're increasing whenever deployed, creativity.
That's something from a rooman.
This is something from a rooman of Patricia Highsmith.
Highsmith is one of my favorite service.
It's the brillant and surrounded the American literature.
From her is "The Fremde in the current maybe," and Ripley," and Ripley," and it's about how eifying eifying the mind, and we're in the spirit of the mind, and we're in this mind, and what's in this moment in the mind.
Let's take Tom Ripley, their books.
First Tom Ripley you want to be what you have, and you have, and you've got aster, and you're like to be voice, and you're like to react on your name, he's going to be smoke your name, your bank.
This is a method.
But what should we do? We can't do it like Tom Ripley.
I can't be the whole world, even if I would like to do it.
It's a shoot, because we live in a newspaper.
We live in a "eifer's victims.
We're all good brought about the social media, in the citizens of neid. Stimes?
At the roman the roman the evidence? I'm not sure.
Now, we do that what Charaacts are doing if they're not sure when they're not sure of a range of a range of a radiation.
Let's go to 221 bacter and asking the slock Holmes.
Think people think about holmes, because they think they think about his nemes as a professor Moriarty, this general result.
But I always moved <unk>In't speaking the carrator, the Chef of Scotland Yard with the head of a radiation, the holmm Gene, but it takes it.
That's how I'm so such.
So Lestrade his hair, it turns out and it turns it into the stories, and it's the stories of the stories.
But as they're working on something to change something to change something like, and finally in "The Six Napoleon" as a holm, and all with his solution, and all of his solution, and says, "We're not going to say, "We're not going to be able to be a molutely new mar.
We're stoping."
And he's not going to be able to be in Scotland Yard Holmes, the Sherlock Holmes don't want to be the hand.

And who's all about this: the good lestrade, the good lestray, the guy, the Ripley, the Marcel Proust, Marcel Proust.
We're in exciting our society.
Thank you very much.
I was about 10 years old, and I was about 10 years old, and I was in the Airon, in the Airon, aircraft, a wildness in the northern Camping New York.
It was a wonderful day.
The wald funkel.
The sun, the sun, like bubble as well asked Glas from the blash, and if there were no pad, you could have a path that we can have the first people who are going to go through these waldoman.
We came to our collection.
I saw the little hips on a clippe and blicked about a crystal crystall crystal, wonderful sea, as a little bit of a bit of a bit.
Hinter the daughter was a mouth, maybe 4 percent of the virus, with Apfel Cernernern Cernern Cernern Cernominiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminium.
I was amazing, I was wished and I was confused.
The colds were too launching what they were doing, what they thought they thought they thought they thought them?
The question I was telling me and I was.
Who do we look at us?
How do you see it or where the "uns" or where the point, who's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in Isolutely?
Who are you going to be able to be in Rio? Other or in Paris or in London?
Here in New Yorks, the city of the city of every day, every day,000 tons of 11,000 tons of tons of Tons and 2,000 tons of Tons.
I wanted to know them -- as Individuals.
I wanted to understand who's the job.
How is it to train to train and this citizens?
So I started a research project with them.
I'm going to go to the lashing, and I love the route and interviews in Bros and an early stage in the whole stadts, but I was still a lot of stuff.
I had to go to go.
So I took a job as a job as a robot.
I don't just won't just going to take the lashing.
And I realized most of the mechanical bests and powerful.
It was a remarkable privilege and a remarkable experience.
Everybody wondering.
He's not so present, but as you think about how to do is really hard to the tail, you're really sleep, you're right, you're right.
And the violence you're just hard.
I know people who were doing these jobs. The more years. The body has been still being able to kill their body on the violence, tons of mothers, tons of mothers.
Then there's the true.
After statistics of working in the work of the work is the box in the city of the city of the city in the country. And I learned Jobs.
You're all the day in the mind, all sort of saughter.
All right, and I want to be able to pick the cars, not enough.
That's really bad for the worker.
And the mothers is full of gified, the volume, and smelling and smelling.
I also learned about the immortality of the mothers.
If you look at the box and the piece of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers, you see that mothers are like a nature of a nature of a nature.
He doesn't hearing to decide.
It's also like a kind of a sort of the circulation.
He has to be in movement.
And then there's the stigma.
You're going to be able to get us to someone -- and you know, and you know, and you know, because you know, because you're going to be able to take the coffee with the waiting or a pause or a coffeee, or a coffeeee and they're going to come and say that they're going to come and say that they're going to com
I think this stigma particularly ironic, because I think that the memory of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city. That's three reasons.
They're the water of the public health.
If they didn't remote, every day efficient and efficient and efficient, he would be able to spend the brain and the misses, and the property we'd be remained.
Crank diseases that we had been disease, and centuries were under control, and we would be able to turn out.
The economy needs.
If we can't help the old crams, we can't have a place for the news of economy, if the economy, if the consume from consumption.
I don't think the capitalism, I know, just on the way.
And then there's what I call our average, non-concious stories.
And I just like, I just like fast, we're going to use movement.
We don't know about our coffeeeee, our coffeeee, our tasks or our water, or our water, or what's going to repair.
We take them, they're going to take them because we know that people are, because we know that people are in the other side of the other side.
So I want to tell you some way today, how we can think about stady to connect the stigma to connect the stigma and they can bring in these difference, how to make a city and human.
The work, so I think, is kind of a sort of liturgic.
You see the streets, they're looking at the street.
They met in many cities.
You know, you can expect them.
And their workers are going to do our work.
They're like a piece of piece.
The eye that they're going to behavior, hold us to imagine ourselves, ourselves, and that's always have to be able to be able to be able to be able to behavior.
At the day, after the 11st 2001, I heard the Donner of a mothers on the street, biff, basically my little son, and the treping the trees and there was a man who was a man whole paper.
And I tried to be him for his work, and I started to think about this day, but I started to get all days.
And he looked at me and he said, "All, and he said, "Alles."
"All right."
And I started to be after I started to start my neighborhood and mettle.
His name is Pauly and we've been working on, we've been good friends.
I wanted to believe that Pauly.
All right.
But in our books that are change the way we can change the way we have to change the planet as a species, we have to be able to do all the cost of the most human cost of the work.
And we had to be able to be able to reach the people who are doing their experience, how we can think about how we think about how we can think about how we can think about the systems that we can read us to read us to read us to read the past.
Instead, we think about mothers, we think about mothers, if we're talking about mothers of the national After the national After the national After the national After all.
It's a remarkable statistics.
In your life, in your life, in your life, in the middle of your life, if you see the next time you see the job it's going to take you a moment, you're true to make a moment, they're true time.
Take a moment, to make a moment.

There was a time, in the large problems we've large problems.
At 21. Juli 1969 smallered box of Mondlande, from Mondlande Apollo 11 and straight on the mountain.
Armstrong and Aldrin were all, but their opposite, but their opposite monoberflow, the highly powerful monitor.
The Apollo-Program was the greatest free-pollo-mobilization in the United States of America.
To to the Mondon, investments, investments, investigating nASA, or four percent of the boundaries or four percent of the boundaries of the boundary.
Apollooration working for 400,000 people and he worked by 20,000 people and supports of 20,000 companies, universities and bodies.
People are also the best of the catch of the apollo 1.
But to the end of the end of the Apollo-Programms 24 people to Mondon.
From the second, the surface, the surface, after the Tod of Armstrong in the last year, the last year, the last year.
But why they went?
They don't need much to go back: 380 kilogram, and something that all 24, and something that every 24, and something that we're going to be a new sense of it is a new small and collective.
Why did they go to the cynically seen, they went to show you because President Kennedy because the Sowjets had better response.
But cennedy Worte Worte from 1962, in 1962, a better hin movement.
For approach was not just a polloid of the West, you know, the first time,
First of all, the time was the most sense of the emotion of the emotion of the emotion of technology.
They float to the moon because it was something great.
The moonelanding a culis of a longer series of technological tumphead.
First of the first half of the 20th century, the flying and the flight and the flight and the flight and airplane, and a vacculosis.
In the middle of the century, Polio and the police.
Technology, something that was a little bit about what Alvin Topler 1970, a "by" called "board"
For the grandman history couldn't fast as a picture or a picture or a picture or a picture of segret with segrets, but in 1969, the management of course of course,
Since 1970, not human values are not human beings.
Nobody has a fast, you know, as the best way to move 10, and the unconscious optimism, and the power of the power of the power of the technology issue problems that we've got to solve the technology to solve the memory of the memory.
I remember that I remember when I was as a five-year-old.
And the appollo 17, and my mother was involved me too very in the saturn of the saturn of the saturning.
I had a similar that this last mission would be hundreds of mission, but I was hundreds that it would be in my life on the mars.
The expression is "etwashed with our ability to solve our ability to solve with technology," is to be a plattitive.
You hear it all over.
We've heard this in the last two days at TED.
It's a prediction of technology, and it's able to record and even with themselves with a player, and members like iPhones and social media, or algorithms and algorithms, or algorithms.
It's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have our lives and remained our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems.
What's happened?
There's a lot of explanation from the Silicon Valley, where you're going to be less than you've been lessed in the less companies were in the corner, in the inteltels, micros, Apple, and Genechancted.
In Silicon Valley says, the markets, the markets, in the bond of the present of the present of the companies, which are business.
Silicon Valley says that Risks are moving in the risk of it, which is moving ideas, and statting ideas, and stattle ideas or even thought problems or even though problems or even far.
But this explain, I'm not good enough.
It's actually explained what happens with Silicon Valley not stimply.
Even to their risks to their risks of Risks Risk, Risks, winvestors. Winzine investments with a sense of 10 years ago.
Investors, we had always been in technologies like energy in technologies like energy, which is a enormous effects and the development and the development and reading the development and relationships, and relationships, never have never been a technology.
No, the reasons why we can't solve problems, are complicated and deeply less.
Sometimes we decided to be the big problems.
We could fly fly flying when we want to fly.
NASA has been decided a planet.
But for the mars to fly, a political decision of public decision of public box and so that's never happen.
We're not going to be fly because everybody's important to the Earth is important things that are going to be done.
One of the big problems, we can't solve our political systems.
Today, more than two percent of the energy of energy consistent of the Earth of the Earth, like Solarence, like Solarengy, like Solars and biocraft, and the reason, and the reason, and the reason, and the reason.
Coal and supply, coal and support than solars and wind and wind and windower than biocraft.
We all want to be old energy quality that can't exist. But it's not existing.
Now, it's so that evolution, companies and economics and economics in the principle of the same memory of the same practics and international practices and international practices.
But in the side political climate chimate chimate that the energy politics of the U.S. or the United States or the international Abcome and recording these monitories.
Sometimes are deeply problems that are technological problems that are not solve.
It was long as long as long as a long time of life in the side of life.
But 30 years of research has given us that hungry is political crises are catastrophal effects that are catastrophal effects.
Technologies can do things like experiences like Lager and transportation of life, but it's going to be better, but it's going to be able to give you a long governments.
And then, you're going to be big problems, because we don't understand the problem, because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon, in 1971, the war, but you're going to be found that there are many kinds of arts, and you know, many species of circuities that most of the most impactive therapy, and they're going to be the last 10 years, and they're going to be the last 10 years, and the last 10 years, and
Swired problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve technologies can solve technologies.
We can have to be able to read this four elements, but all of this: Four politicians and the politicians and the politicians, a problem to solve the solution; institutions, and we have to be able to be able to be able to be a problem.
The apollomision that was a kind of metaphor was a kind of technology, big problems, big problems, it's a criteria.
But this is a model that can't be repeated in the future.
It's not the year 1961.
There's no dramatically dramatically like the calts like the war, no politicians like John Kennedy, and it's not a high-dohn Kennedy, and no money, and no politics like the Science fiction of the Science.
But all of the way, it was the end, it was just to flying the end of the Mondon.
He was just three days.
And it's a realizabel, whether it's really a serious problem.
We're in ourselves and the solutions of the future of the future.
Because God, it's not going to be able to help us to help us.
Thank you very much.
I want to send you to walk a little eyes.
If you're going to stand up your hand.

Okay. Now, open the eyes.
I want to tell you about a very bizaries, weathered to tell you that every year in New York City, in New York City.
He's called States Memory Champion.
A few years ago, I wanted to make this wettle as science as science and he was used to be repected in the same year.
It was a hypen and some guy dames, and some of the whole thing about all different alter and Hygia and Hygia.
They were turning up after a bed hundreds of hundreds of numbers.
Larning the name of duting and use the use of unknown.
and maybe all the memory in just a few minutes.
They could be able to record the ripped the ripped cards a cards on the fast cards.
That's trying to be.
These people have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to be abilities.
I started to start with some of them.
This is Ed Cook, a guy who's come from England, and there's one of the most remained generated brain.
And I asked him, "Ed, what you're going to be able to do that you're going to be this particular example?"
And Ed said, "I'm not an inside.
I just have average of average.
Everybody who's going to be determined or she's just average or she's just average.
We all have to turn together with calculate these incredible, these incredible general general genderships. Technology. Technology that have been in 200 years ago, and that's the grandchildren.
And I thought, "Wow, how comes to heard about it?"
We stood up there, weathered the weather and Ed, this wonderful, this wonderful, and something exciting, and something exciting to me, "Yosh, you're a American Journalist.
Can you're going to be a britney Spear?"
I said, "What?
"I would like to bring Britney Spears like you're going to record the ripped cards of a guy cards. U.S.. U.S.
It would be the world that everybody can do that everybody can do."
I said, "I'm not going to tell you, but you couldn't get me to tell me.
I mean, you have to start somewhere, not true?"
And that was the beginning of a very small recording for me.
A lot of the next year, I spent the next year, I don't just to train my memory, but also to understand it, but also to understand how it works, and how it works, why it works not even works and what it could be.
I really interesting a lot of interesting people.
This is the example.
He's suffering memory and it's really the bad device, and it's the world.
Hism is so bad, it's so bad that he's not even sure that he's not even remembers. What's amazing.
Although it was so tragic, he was a bottlicke about how much of our memory is to make us.
On the other side of the spectrum of the spectrum.
Christmas.
He was the idea for Dustin Hopmans Character in the film "Rain Man."
We spent after after after that, in the public books in Salt Lake City telephone City telephone. It's a simplicated.
And I came back to a whole staple came up with a whole stapture about the memory, Abhandles that were in the age of 2,000 years ago, and more in the middle in the middle of the middle.
And I really like to really interesting things really interesting things.
Bascinating me that there was a time to training that there was a time to training the idea that memory to training the memory, not to cultivate how today, not today, as he's as he's as he'd like today.
There was a time to people in their memory in their memory investigating, it's going to be able to make it.
And the last few year, we have a couple of technologies, we have a series -- from the alphabetics, for the code, for the code, the potography, the photography, the computer, the smartphone -- the smartphone -- the simply.
These technologies have changed our modern world, but we've changed our modern world.
They've changed us to change and I would have changed that they've changed us to be cognitive.
On the notwork, it seems to remember when we'd have to be as a harming how this is.
One of the last places where you can find people who are still still being able to training their memory, cultivate their memory, and cultivate, this is a cultivate general great memory.
In fact, it's not so such a single world, there are words like this on the world.
And that's what I wanted to know how these people doing this.
A few years ago, a research in the university College London, a group of Greater's in Laborists in Labor.
They wanted to know, Is the structure or anatomy of their brains than the rest of us?
The answer was: No.
Are they clearly as we?
They gave them a stapel Kognition, and the answer wasn't.
There was a interesting thing, and there was a lot of difference between the brain of a brain of a brain of a brain, and the control, and the control.
If you put them in a fMRIMaschine, and you can see their brain, while they're called Nummers, laws and images of snows, you can see that in the brain, you can see that in the brain.
It seems like they're using the part of their memory, the memory, which is used to use the rather than the rather than the rather than the rather than the rather than it.
Why? And why can we learn other?
The wettled to the best generates is going to be a kind of a kind of weathered by a sort of a new technology, in every year, in any calculating in the fast year, and the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest.
This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three-dimal giving memory.
And the table of them are 36, 36,000 cards the first cards that he's going to be inside a technology that he's experienced and as a single thing.
He used a similar technology to make the exactly the exactly returns out of 40 to 140 to a half-four binary standing.
Yes.
And even though it's a computer to technology to make things in these weather things in these wettle things in these forms, but all these technology, but all of these technology, the psychologists, the psychologists called "boloard."
So this is called Bcker<unk>Baker<unk>Baker Paradox illustrated this conception, it's the same thing: If I'm going to be able to think about two persons, and I say, "Mever, and I say, "Mever," and I'm going to be a person."
That's his name.
And I say, "Merk you, "Merker is a person who is a person who's a person."
If I'm going to go back to you back to your time and say, "We know, "We knows what I've been there for a word that I've been talking about a time?
Because you know what words?"
The person who are called Baker, the person is to remember, he remembers with just a probability of the words that person who should be a person with the person with the person with the person.
Even word, different exploration, different experience, that's sort of smaller.
What's going on here?
Well, the name box box is nothing.
He's absolutely unprected by all the memory of all the memory that in your head.
But the box of the box, we know, we know.
Backer training comically from the mothers.
Backer have mistakes.
Bocker running, if they come from working on the work.
Maybe we can know a box.
And if we hear the words, we're going to hear this approach these eye, and we're just remembers later, it's just recording to record.
The brain is that we're going to be able to find what's going to be able to find the brain, and that's going to be able to find all the way to find all the way to find better things to find a way to find better.
One of the filter participate technology can be 200 years ago, 200 years,
It was a memory, when you get the memory.
The story is how following his shape: There was a drawing simones, which is a fest named Simones.
He was for the difference to understand the sustainable, because if you wanted to be a really big party, you don't want to be a draw.
He's true to be the memory of the memory and recording the space. In the space. In the moment, and it starts together and start together.
Not only are all dead, their body are untility to uncognition.
Nobody can say who's never been telling, no one know where who's healthy.
The body can't be certained.
It's a dragedy to the other.
Simones are you seeing a few survival survival survival. He's the eyes and place its opposite, he's going to see that he can see his eyes inside the eye of the eye of where it's almost.
And so it's the connection of the country and leads them through the tears.
In this moment, we're going to understand what we all know intuitive, we know that we know that we're also know that we're also known as well as well as well, particularly memory, we can think we can think about a very good visual.
I'm going to tell you the first 10 words of the story about Simonides, so that would find it be difficult to find it.
But I would say if I was going to remember you would remember who would remember in this moment on a spread in your photoyer, then you could sit down the problem, then you could problem the problem.
The idea of the idea of the idea is to build a building inside the memory of the eye, and it's ability to fill the images -- you know, bizarrier, bizarrier, less, less, less, less, the left, the left, the left is so strength, the left.
This is a rather, the rather than 2,000 years old, the latest lately,
So how does it work?
You're going to get you to get here in TED, to get a talk to TED, and you want to get half a talk of the memory, just like Cicero, just as Cicero, as Cicero, and he would have been done in 2000 years ago.
You can even imagine: Stell your heart, you can imagine your hand.
Stell third a absolutely and drawing story with unfortunately pictures to remember that you're going to remember that you're talking about this greatest forest weight.
And then you go into your house and she's the cridge of the cridge of money. Ed. Ed. Ed.
And that would remember that you're remember, your friend Cook,
And if you want to tell you Britney Spears, you're going to tell you a luster covered a luster, you want to tell you.
You can go to your books, and the fourth thing, and the four things you want to talk about the fourth, this same recording to the distributed for a year, and you're helping you help you help you help you help you help you're helping you.
So the memories running restic rest of their answer -- not word for words, but it's just approaches for thema.
The English reefs "topic centerce," a sentence," which is the thema," which means "topos" which means "Stopos," which means "Stopos,"
These are surprised by the people who are talking about anticipate and radical rehaderships.
The formulation "an first sentence" is, "An't really explored," "Anter" in your common.
I found that all simple, and I'm still still there.
And to a few memory of a few memory.
I wanted to write a little longer about this subculture of the common culture of the common culture.
But there was a problem.
The problem that the memory is the memory of vastices area,
It's like a group of people who are writing and a test.
It's already when somebody's going to be the slow.
I'm Journalist, I need something about it.
I know that the most exactly the most extraordinary things in the case of these people who happened.
So if I wanted to tell this story, I had to try to try to try to try to try to try to make me in their country.
And so I started to learn every morning 15 to 20 minutes, before I was involved to learn something that's kind of a little bit of a little bit of approach.
Maybe a memory or a memory or
The name year, I booked on age, which I've buying on the floor.
I had to make it funny, it's a lot of fun.
I could never imagine that.
It's not made a funny because it's not about it.
You want to be better and better and better and better, these loss, these loss, they're going to be able to read and hopefully, and hopefully inside your eye.
I'm served me.
Here I'm going to take my standard-time memory-Training.
A pairs and a couple of a carry, and a small street, and a little street, because Abling the greatest farmers of the greatest fine of the greatest fight.
I went to the same weathered the same thing I had a year I had a year.
And I went to myself, just as a young, just as younalistic experiment.
It could be a nice epilog for my neighborhood.
The problem was that the experiment doesn't fly asked.
I won the weather, what's really happened to happen.
It was nice, radio, and telephone and telephone and telephone, but that wasn't what I wanted to do.
These are just terricks.
Tricks the work because they work on some simple ideas about the function of our brain.
You don't have to build a memory or thought or you can build a cards to build a card of the function of the function of the function of the memory.
We're talking about people with good memory, as if it's a particular example, but that's not true.
Good means that are intrained.
We think of things better if we're better when we're going to make things.
We remember when we're engaged.
We remember the opportunity to find out why we can have information and experience, and experience, like they're using to understand how they can understand them in a way to understand them in our others, if we can see in our others.
The memory is the memory, these general, these general technology, they're all just available.
In fact, it's not maling citizens.
They work because they work because they work to work.
They're going to work and recording to be in a way, in a way that we're not in a way that we're not.
But it's not a citizens.
So things are going to be diseases in the memory.
After a thing I want to give you away with the way that I'd like to be a man whole man who is not even at his greater, because the memory problems, the summary life.
How many are we going to remembers with our own lives, and we're going to lose our blackberry or our iPhone or our iPhone or our iPhone, and we're going to be able to remembers, how do we're going to be able to be able to remember that we're to be able to remember,
I learned that the memory, in every single of us, incredible capacazities.
If we want to live a memory, we have to remember the person who don't understand the person who don't understand.
Thank you.
In the age of 27, I was a stranger Job in the companies, in the companies: until you're strange.
And the public schools in New York, I was mathe for you.
As every teacher, I led to tests and presented through the present.
I gave house.
When the work, I'm going to go back to the noved.
There was no song the I<unk><unk>n't the only difference between the best smart and bad smart.
The i<unk>s a less of my strong stratosphically.
Some of my bad children were not very well.
That's what I think.
What you're in the 7. school in Mathe is difficult: Rational numbers: Rational numbers, the flower of a parallelogram.
But uncompossible, I wasn't finished that all my southerns of the students of the students, if they could work and hard enough they're working and hard enough.
After a few years in school, I came to the school that we came up in the education of a lot better understanding a lot of perspective of a perspective of a perspective of perspective the perspective perspective.
What we can we have in the best message is the best message, but what if you can come in school and life of many more ability to learning and live in school and live in school?
So I finally, I found the classroom and made a psychologist.
I started to kids and expecting in all kinds of ultra-ligher-like situation. Immer, I'm going to be a successful and why?
My research, and I went to the West Point Military.
We tried to figure out what cadetting city in trops of trops of trops and what wouldn't.
We went to national books and trying to figure out and trying to farmers who would come from the other kids.
We're looking at Jungle, the very difficult wired to work and figured and figured the end of the school teachers, which would be under the end of the school and what they would be interesting the culture of their slightly.
We sleeparts with private parents and asked their workers and asked their workers, which are the working their works.
And who's most money would be money.
In all these different contextexed contexed a sense of economy as a piece of success.
Our it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good experience, and it wasn't I<unk>.
It was a distribution.
And so, increasingly, long-term and expressional clearly long-term.
And so it's sustainable.
And so, increasingly, if you look at a future, not just for a week or a week or a week or a month, but really hard to work for years, and really hard to use this planet.
And so it's life as a marathon, not sprint.
At a time I started in public schools in Chicago Department.
I'm thousands of the students of the skin of second question to the distribution, and then I was made a year to see a year to see a year to see who made a year to see who made a year.
It turns out that children with higher determinary developments, probably the appears, even if I could all message, even if I've all the ways of families, things like families, as a certain kind of course, as they're in the testing.
So, increasingly not just in Westpoint and representation, but also in the book, but also in school, but also in school, particularly in school, especially.
The first thing about this is the most exciting thing that we know that we know that the science of science, how to know how to build it.
Every day, I asked me to teacher: "How do we under the distribution of children?"
How do I live a children a such work?
How did I do it for Distances?"
The real answer: I don't know.
But what I know is that you're not a dola, and there's no drawing.
Our data shows that many dealent that many dealent people don't just simple,
In fact, in fact, after our explains, not after our explored, but it's not deal with talent.
So the best idea that I've been possible to the terms of during the same thing that's so as well asked a construction.
This idea was approached in the stanford University of Carol Dweck and to learn the survivality of the ability to learn to learn that they can't change with your insight.
Dr. Dock has taken that children when they learn about the brain and learning how it's a responsibility and learning how much more likely, and it's a lot of probably because they don't believe that they don't believe that a percent.
These growth is a great dead capture is a great idea for the terms of during the terms of during the terms of drawing.
But we need more.
So here I want to be my business, we're going to be so far.
That's the work that's what's going on.
We need to be our best ideas and strong the most predictions and deeply.
We need to be able to have to be able to be ready to have to be able to learn to learn to learn and learning people to learn and from learning.
In other words: We need to give user the sustainable children, our kids areas.
Thank you very much.
In the center of my work is the connection of translations of our community and part of our community and part of the environment, where architecture from the natural recognitions, local recal removery.
Today, I have as a example of this, two effectual projects with this.
Both projects are in Swells, a swelling in a tunes and a in Tunesia and a in Tunesia.
They also have a common that the different analyze that the different perspective perspective perspective part of the final architecture.
The first example, the first example, a more powerful editation, a more power in Ethiopia, Haustadt Adis, Adisbe Adis Adisbe Adis.
That's the kind of building that we should be, and I think, as a example of what we should be decided to be done.
First, I thought I wanted to wanted to wanted to wanted to do.
After we saw a few of these buildings -- there are many of them -- there are many of them in the city -- we've three wonderful memoral memories.
First, these areas are almost easy, because they can't be very large large large cases, things can't buy things.
Secondly, they need enormous energy because the surface, which is the surface in the inside inside the inner, and then you need a lot of cool.
In a city, in a city that doesn't happened, because they've been able to get the entire year between 20 to 25 money between 20 to 25 money.
And thirds, her identifying with Africa and <unk>thiopia.
This is a place with a place with a place with a such culture and Tradition.
And then I was in our first quite, I was really extremely, really, really, from the old market with this film-shope, where thousands of people are highly highly highly in little hands.
It's also have this idea of public space that the eye that the eye of activity to create activity.
So I thought that's exactly what I really want to do is not a shopping Mall.
But the question was like we could make more possible, question of the principle building with these principle.
The next challenge came out when we got the reason that we were in a reality, because it's in a right growth, because it's in the city of the city that you see on the city that you're not there.
And it's about two parallels, the two parallels that have no connection.
As a seriously, we've been able to put these two streets, and we all have all the eings of the buildings.
This is what's going to be in a surrounded a moview that a moview in the buildings in the buildings, who are suns through his own freedom and regenerate.
To summary place, we're going to change the idea of a market with little cave, the form of the high-time, because of the high-rums,
I also think about, how do we flying this building?
I really wanted to find a solution that are reacting on the local color conditions.
I started thinking about textilies, like a sales from Beton with Perforations, which is air, which is air, but in filter filter filter filter filter filter filter filter filter filter filter filter.
Then inspired me to these bad colors inspiring color, women.
They have the own embractal Geometry and the half of my family family family.
We build this little bit of these little bits, the fears that are the air, the air, the air, and light on the air, we're going to leave.
And that's going to be able to use this little bit of the lights that the lights from the buildings to use the buildings to get the building.
It wasn't just the buildings with these ideas that ideas that they thought, because they thought, "That's not shopping mall. That's not best."
But then we all have allowed that this idea of the market is much profitable than the idea of a left of a left of a left, because they can basically reason, because they can buy more cases.
And the concept of the fassade was much, much, much, much more non-time, but also because we don't have a climate, but also we don't need to have a climate more clearly.
So we're going to make some costs that we use the projects that we use the project.
The first environment was to think about how we could make the buildings are building energy, in a city that would be done in a city that almost domains.
We're going to take a whole broke by solar panel on the roof.
And we're going to stand up the distributed as new public space with a new room with aircraft and bars, and bars that urban Oaseban Oase oas.
These vordinary on the roof of the water to the water to the water.
Hopefully the next year, because we have the construction to five.
The second example is a machine for 2,000 well-made and in tunism and in tunis.
And took a big project, the big project, the biggest project that I had to understand the city I had to understand the city, but also understand the culture, but also the culture.
While this analyse, I was particularly on the medina, which is the 1,000 years old structure, which was able to be able to be able to be able to figure out, and it was connected by 12 tored line.
When I was a piece of the first step, the first steps that the best streets to create the first 12 bubble 12 bubble, with older and embrace and embraces like the Barcelona and each other in the cities.
So we would have a strategic punctic punctic punctic puncture of this tore and concept this tore and concepting them with guys and the urbane.
The last step was thinking about the cell, about the cell, the little cell, the small cell, as a wave as a wilding part of the Master plansplane.
What would be the best exciting in a mediterran cranena for a wire?
This is North South, on the temperature of the temperature between the two house, and a natural decided and a natural development.
So let's start to be a pattern of what most important in these directions are perfectly perfectly in these direction.
And that's the result, it's almost like a combination of a european bubbish bubbish stadt.
There are the blocks with high and in the earthquake, there are these whole connections for footprints.
It also also remarkable progressive, the high-time distory in the operation and a song decided in the Etail.
It also understand the concept of Tore.
The volumes has this connection, the same form of three different various wireless, and leaderships, and leaderships in very important in the middle of the inside the inside of the inside.
The thing that my favorite is where the project, there's the community, the space, the space that's going to be able to get the building.
And there can be after all the news and do things like a 2-km-cluding things like a 2-km-clocking.
These are instance, these two examples have a common answer to the deficient.
They're in swelling in schools, you can see the cities, you can see the cities.
In these cities, the effecture of the architecture in the power of the people who are local community and economic systems, like the building systems.
So I think it's important to be important that architecture, but before the paid solutions that the relationship between the environment and the environment and the environment and people who are connecting nature and people.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about conversation and I want to remember the memory of connections about connections.
They're so much more consistent that they're going to be certain.
There's my answer is my answer.
First, a mistake: Consciously, believe in the back, many.
Then a goal: We should be more confused.
And one thing: We should be able to build the consumption.
I think the reason that the target, and the goal, and the tasks on false.
I want to tell you a different story about a target, and a goal, and a lot of better another answer that a lot better answer to the things that are better at the things.
He's the brain: Why people think that people think that trust being to be returned back?
And if I really want to think about my actual knowledge: I know the answer.
Maybe it has some activities or an activities or in other cities and in other maybe.
I think the minute of the survival.
But I can look at the environment, the environment that are the source of the oilar to the glue for the glue for the gluster.
Look at the memory of a time, you're not a lot of movemential movemential materials.
Socusa is going to be the people who were recorded 20 years ago, hallupts, and politicians, and politicians, still still misstrautes.
And the people who were really crazy, the people were still very long, very long, Richarents, crankanwes.
We're going to be able to do is the average of the average of the average in the middle.
But that's a good movement?
My farmers, he's learning -- maybe.
What could they sunny?
So they look at the common settings of people who are going to be asked to be asked questions.
Do you politicians? Communicians?
If you're going to be available: Compan?
Do you might be a fisher?
Do you reason?
And then you'd say, "Inwards, "Inwhat?"
And that would be a sense of reaction.
And if you're going to understand the answer, you might say, "I don't have some of them, but not."
Virtuational.
So we're trying to try to make our course, constructions on different kinds of species.
We don't go to that we don't think we're not going to be in a obvious or institutional institutional institutional institutional institution.
So I could say that I could say that I could get a particular reason, I could go to the first basically go to the first classroom, but I wouldn't get the les, but I wouldn't go to school.
Maybe I know you're not good attention that they don't good auto.
I trust to say that my bad friends, my black friends a friends on the sun, but maybe not be a brain, but maybe they don't true.
Simplic.
So we know from our attention, how different consumption can look like this, but how do we look like this knowledge, if we look at this knowledge?
The environment here is very bad excited about the real powerful considering people who are ignore people who are ignored, because you're ignored.
Second, we come to the goal.
The goal is to be more to understand more.
And I said, I think, I'm going to goal.
And I wouldn't go to play.
I would try to try to trust to represent more to be able to return the conservation, but not.
I'm such a activity of activity, considered not to be able to be able to be able to be trust.
And the only one who are certainly. B. Earth, their hands in the hands of a certain madope, like the name, like the name, so that's what the streets," and then I'm going to be able to do with me, "You know," I'm going to be a lot of trust.
"More," is not a clean goal in this life.
Clusive a single-time and to prove the goal.
And then you say, yes, okay, okay, so the most important, but it's not trusting to be trust.
The consumers of people can make a difference.
And to do that, we need to do three things.
Are they complete? Sind it? Sind it? Sind it?
If we're going to be a person in the subject, and you've got a good reason, then we have a good reason, then we've got a good reason, then it's a good reason.
But the person, but unexpected, then it's not.
Some of my friends are completely completely, but they'd be able to let them, because they're not a broken.
I have friends that very in their own common competities, but these things about it, but these things about a little bit about a big.
And I'm very froging about that I didn't have a lot of friends and lose, but inevitable, but inevitable.
If I didn't realized it.
But then we look at, we're looking at the conservation, then we're trust.
Does are the reaction.
The consumers have to have to have to have to have a difficult. That's natural.
And over the last decades, we tried to try to try to all kinds of in all kinds of in all kinds of experts and empower to make their parents that we're doing their conservation.
Many of these systems have the effect.
They don't work how to work.
A homebamed said, "This problem is that the paper is that the paper of paper, as the baby on the world."
And overall in our public actions, in our opening, in our in our insight, this problem. This is the control. This control and global system, but it's cells, but for cells, but for opportunity.
It's like hard people like hard from their half-powered by their half-time crazy.
And here's a sure of every examples.
So much for the goal.
The goal is more conservation, and that's going to be difficult when we want to be able to be able to be able to be others, and if we want to be a different people, or if we want to be a different people, or politicians, or politicians, or politicians.
It's not just a simple. You have to reactions or half-drives or half.
And now, now,
These as a wilding of the construction of the construction, the thing is the thing.
Because it's good attract you and I want you to build.
We can do that, of course,
We can have a little bit of conservation.
So, two people can spend two people in common in common.
But last, it's crazy is trusting to characterized that it's going to be a different from other.
You can't build the other thing that other one.
You have to give them a basis that they have to be a language.
So you have to be trust be available.
And that's what you can't do is that you can't all people to take all people to the nose.
But you have to be movemential materials that you're going to be able to be created.
How do you do that?
That's what every day, every day, every day, normal people do, effective, very effective.
Here's a simple commercial example.
The launch, I buy my socket, and they buy my skin me back to me and they don't want to ask them.
They take back and they go back and give me the money, or a few of the socks in the sugars.
That's great. I'm sure it, because they've been taken me.
Darin is a important moral.
And you can see the opposite about the opposite, that's a very good hand, that you're a very good high-digh-digh-dig well-digh-dig well.
So our goal is not very difficult to recognize very difficult.
It's relationship between people, and the only people who are involved, and whether the other people who are different.
So the moral of story is, very less than trusting to think about constructions, or institutions, or increasingly, or increasingly, and more consumption, and much more consumption, and how to be more people are just about people, and how to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Thank you.
You know, the best thing about the vather than the films that I can look at me.
I love it, my own line, my own career with my children with my children. When my daughter four years old, we've been built.
The movie, she didn't have anymore.
You can line, of course, of course, of course.
So she had a good exciting, a gliterally cover and a cleider and a clean,
But if you look at these moviews enough, you know how extraordinary, you know, it's actually extraordinary.
We live in the home time and we're living our children in a spectacular children in a specific industry.
But "The Tauberer of Oz" was different.
He didn't have this trend.
It has 40 years, until this trends up to this trend through -- interesting with -- interesting -- a different film, a guy, and a guy, and a girls with many fellows, by a girls.
You know where I'm talking about, right?
Guy.
Now there's a big difference between these two films, even more big difference between the survey between the films of ozers that we look at the films that we look at this today.
First, there's a smart in "The Tauberer of Oz" very important violence.
The monkey are pretty creative, eventually as the apart.
But I think, if "The Tauberer of Oz" today," he would have been produced the caught, "Thy, you'd say, "Thy, you're going to be a produced by ocean.
Bene your magical schools to create the computers to create the big poor creatures of the wests."
But it doesn't happen.
Another point I'm looking at the "The Meberer of Oz" is very single thing that the help and clearly never been able to help and even never female, and even never female.
And I realized the first time I was asked my daughter "Star Wars" which was after what years later was different.
At the time, I had a sonisfall, I had a son.

I want to talk to you about the story of a cleinstadtkind.
I don't know his name, but it's not because his story.
He lives in a small dorf in the south of Southalias.
His you're in the narrative of Mogadian.
The door extremely, the poverty and the poverty and the hungry.
When it wasn't there, what he was there, he was him, he went into the city, and he went into this city, Mogadian, Mogadian, the main sumalias.
When he's also approach there's no way to do not work, no work, no work.
At the end of the end of Mogadian, and there are a half of Mogadianu.
It maybe a year, but it's nothing.
One day, he's going to be a man whole managed to the Middle, then after the average, then for the crime.
He trying to make this dynamic groups and they give them a chance.
He's a little money to buy new covering new color and to buy the money to be home.
You're going to be a question.
And finally, he's explained.
He starts a new life.
His life has a sense.
Any day in Mogadian, in Mogadian, under automobile phone in the air.
This cleinstadtcind with grandmother was the same thing of self-marter and bombs and bombs and bombs and these dynamic group of people were older, a terrorism with connections.
How could the story of a cleinstadtcind, that just trying to use the grandchildren in the grandchildren in the air, so he was in the air.
He had been waiting.
He had been a violence, he was approaching, and it was the first opportunity, and it was the first opportunity that he was both.
It was the first thing that he was out of a custry, because we call "Waithood"
And his story again, again, over again, again, and over the world.
It's the story of the story, working on the urban Johannesburg and London United Streg and London Unruption and after something else.
Now people are surely different from the city, from their grandchildren, the city, maybe, work, but young people, but you don't have approaching their cities, but you don't have approach their cities.
Of the past time, the join that are high-foresty working.
In 203030, three of five-five-four-year-olds than 18 years.
If we don't have young people in the cities, if we don't have a possibilities, "What", "Well," which is astrorism, in the violence in the violence in the middle of 20 money.
In my buildings, Mogadian, Mogadian, 70 percent of the young people under working in the young people.
70 percent, don't go to school.
They don't do anything.
Last Monather, I'm going to give months and I went to Madina Crankhouse, where I was born, where I was born.
I remember how I remember this cranks, and I asked me, what would be asked me, what if I never wondered?
What if I was to the same country of the same country?
Who I won't won't won?
I'm not sure what I should be.
The reason for my months in Mogadian was actually the exciting of a giant crime, and the effects of a giant and companies.
I needed 90 June Calcular leadership.
We sat down together and we made a breaking a biggest challenges for the largest challenge.
In space, why was a young man, Aden.
He was the university in Mogadian and made his eye and he made his eye.
There was no work and no work and no way.
I remember how he said he was that he was a university of a university, worked on the perfect, and eating the perfect came to be perfectly at old cababa and other terrorganizations.
They looked like him.
But this story is a different lunch.
In Mogadianu are the largest hinds to Biggest holds that streets.
Two years of citizens have the street system, the street system, so that the motorrad the best food.
And the effects of the opportunity and he's what they're doing.
He opened a motorrad.
He started to be motorres of place to be able to remain the suns that they couldn't sun.
With his family and friends and friends, he buy 10 motorres and he was sort of its business, it's kind of three years,
How do wear that story of the other?
What's the difference?
I think it's his ability to recognize a new opportunity and use it.
It's the company and I believe that company, the company we can be the most painting "Waith"
It's the most people that we're going to create the economic chances that they're looking for them.
You can bring people to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be available.
I want to talk to you about a young man who speaking on a guy who's participant: Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Mohamedohamedoh
He helped me, because the company is a young people who are shared to show you how to show them in the middle and to show them how to show them innovative and companies.
He's actually the first fly the first florist, the Mogadian, and until the course of course, and until Mohamed, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the perfectly, if you want to be perfect the perfectly.
If you've been asked, "Wan you've seen the last time?" And then you saw the last time?" And then the answer of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens."
So Mohamed a violence.
He was a landscape of a landscape with blumblaws.
He lived a plantage of a plantage, and he started to cover and starting to cutch, which he said, what he said, what he said in the race of climate Mogadusa Mogadusa Mogadusa Mogadusadius.
He started to start hands with blumps, and he started private Garden Garrench and stories to work and start working on the city of the first public public public public public public park in Moguadual parks in Moguitual parket.
There's no public parks in Mogadian.
He wants to make a place where families and young people together and how he says that he says that can be smart things that can be enjoy.
And so the rand: He's not a rainforest, because they need to need too much water.
So the first step is to be young people inspiring, and inspiring mohamed Mohamed Anwesternality in the other people in the room.
They never really had never really about it, a companies.
They thought about a nGO to work or for the government or for the government, but this story, its innovation, it's a story,
He remained her city as a place as a place of the opportunities.
He remained them that they could be able to be able to be able to be able to full of change.
And the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges of their city.
They had unparents in the public solutions.
The inspiration young people and the shape of a company is a really big difference, but you need people to use their ideas to use their ideas to capital to try to use their ideas.
They need to make sure and support and until they're developing their business and start to develop their business.
Bring young people with the resources that they need to be able to reduce them in connection, you need the difference that they're going to use ideas to use ideas to use ideas and you're going to catalysism.
For means, I mean, more than just the reasons than just the reasons.
It's about the effects of social effects.
Mohamed not just bought to be simple bubble.
I think he's selling hope.
Hisher than "Freespark" is going to make it when he's going to change their city of people on their city.
At the streets have streets that helps himself to help himself and instantly.
He gave them the chance, from the chance of the country of the "Waith"
These are the young businesses have a enormous expect.
So my idea is, young people, young people to companies, and young people, and you're going to be more innovation and you're going to get more stories and "Free-faceutomobs and "Food" and "Wood" and "Wood" and "Wood."
Thank you very much.
While my childhood in Maine was a my favorite business, after Sanddollars, because my parents of mine because my parents, because my parents are bringing the parents.
But these mushrooms are hard to find.
They're from Sandhels to see.
But after after a routine.
I started to see forems, and matterns that help me to samming them.
The evolved to find things to find things to find things to find things to find a love for past and the archology.
And when I started to studyptologyptologyptology, I realized that the same thing with my block with my block.
Because suddenly, in <unk>gyped my little street in Maine, in Maine, athundamental miles, and mythundamental miles. And my sands. And my sands.
And that led me to use satellite pictures.
I had to see the past, to see the past in a card tools.
I want to show you how we're going to see how we're going to see infrarots.
This is a struggy that are in the possible siptical dola named Mendes.
And the struggled, we need to use it. Benean, but we're working with false, and we're going to be able to be able to make this struggle.
What you see here are the chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemicals and --activities, the old <unk>gypter.
What I want to share with you is how we've been used to find satellite a older to find a older city to find a older who was true, and for thousands of years, and for thousands of years.
It was the mainstadtle was the mainstadtle <unk>gyped up more than four years ago, in a four years ago, in a middle of the average, about four years ago.
The stranges in the <unk>-Fayyptical al-Fayy and she's very big recording to the Midaissance for old recording to older, architecture and religion.
<unk>gyptologenes that the most difficult, that the struggled by It's somewhere in the narrative of the pyramid of the pyramid, but somewhere in this rolligence, but somewhere in this massive.
This building is huge -- the flower -- the flowerful miles.
From flying the nil directly on the same directly, and while his countries and while its countries, and it turns out the city.
So how to find a land-time stadt in a part of the country.
They're going to find the quality of the qualent of the city of the city in the home in the home in the homeball country and baseball cell phone.
So we use nASAs Typography Typography to see a country to see a country to see through empathy.
where the same of the nils found.
But you see, you see, and that's very interesting, this is very interesting, increasingly, increasingly, which means to us as a position for the city of the city of the city.
So we worked with qualities with quarter scientists together with holected together, what you can see here.
That's like Have leaders in the ice, just instead of the sky, the climate change, you look at the human experience, you look at the human extraordinary.
In a deep five meters, under a thick slightly, we found a thick of developed a thicker.
That's what this position is that position for It's five meters, in five meters, we can find a more hundred years, we can find a hundred years, to find a hundred years, to go back to the expects, in the expect of Epexist.
We found outside the water, we found -- carne -- carney -- what's what's going on here is a juweling here.
It may not looking for a lot of, but if you look at the most past sentence that were used by Juwels in the middle of the middle of the middle.
So we found a thought of the population of this struggle, the middle of the middle.
We also found that we found for a juweling society, which shows you what's going to show you that this is a very important stady.
There was no one more else there's no piece, but we're going to show you this struggle to show a card.
What's important is we're going to be survived for youngypter, which are in the satellite technology that they can do with the general decisions that are general discoveries.
So I wanted to wanted to my favorite from the Middle of the Middle of the middle of the city of It was fully from It.

But for a huge amount of chinairs, it's kind of like the grandmana.
In the last years, I've been asking this massive years, how I can do this, so that everyone who has to understand that complex language, and they're going to learn this.
I thought that a new faster model, Chinese model, Chinese, Chinese.
And so, I learned, I learned every single strich for every single strich in the right crifice.

So with this method, you can bring out of the first America,
The next group of eight signs with eight-foots.
With a little bit of a little bit of hundred hundred hundreds of children, like a real child.
If we can start together, we can start together.
For example, he's still collaps and fire, so you're a "Vulkan."
