When I was in my 20s, I had my first psychotherapy psychotherapy patient.
I was Doctorandin and studied clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
Alex in the first situation came, she came to Jeans and a culture twice, and she fellowed her bure, and she told me, and she told me, and he told me, and he told me, and he told me,
And when I heard this was the same thing.
My commilitonins got a brought a brickst patients.
And I got a woman in the 20s, the 20s,
I wrote, I thought, I thought.
But I didn't get it.
With the funny stories that brought the Alex with the situation, it was easy to nick with the head of us, as we move the problems.
"30 is the new 20," he said Alex and I could have appreciate, she had appreciate.
Well, worked later, he came to come to later, kids later, even the death, even the death.
People like Alex, and I didn't have anything as time.
But as soon asked me to ask my bedrow, Alex's live in question.
I thought that.
I said, "Yes, she's clear, she's going to be under their nive, she's not going to be sleeping it, but it's not going to be hearing it."
And there was my bedrowing, "No, but maybe she's the next.
And also, the best time, the best time of Alex's married, who is remove before she's married."
That's what Psychologists call a Aha-Moment.
That was the moment that I realized that 30 is not the new 20.
Yes, people later, people later, people later, but that made a earlier, but that made Alex's not going to development out.
This made Alex's 20s to optimal development, and we sat there, and we sat there, and we sat there.
And I realized that this kind of harmless various various problem with real consequences, and not only for a real consequences. Nich only for Alex and their favorite, but for Alex and experiences, families and exactly all the people in the 20sights.
And at that point, there's a million people in the United States 50 million people in the 20s.
We talk about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent of the population, if you don't have the adults of the adults, without the 20s.
Meldet you're in your life, if you're in your 20s.
I want to see a few of you.
Oh, yeah! You're all incredibly all incredible.
If you worked with someone in the 20s, a loved in the 20s, because of a 20s, I want to see you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
My specials are people in the 20s, because I think that every single one of these 50 million knows that every single one of these 50 million dollars, neurologists, neurologists, neurologists, and the easier to know, and the most easier to know, and the most easier of the 20s.
This is not my opinion. These are facts.
We know that 80 percent of the present moments, in the time,
That means that 8 of 10 decisions, experiences, experiences and Aha-Erlebrate life that's what it's happening to their mid-year-year-old.
Well, not panically if you're talking about 40.
This group is going to go well, I think it's good.
We know that the first 10 years of a profession of a profession of an exponential effects of how much money you're going to be money.
We know that with 30 more than the half of Americans, or with the Americans or with the future partner, or a relationship or a relationship.
We know that the brain is the brain, and last large growth, and then the 20s, and then the adults are distributed to change whatever you want to change whatever you want to change whatever you're going to change this.
We know that the personality is changing the 20s percent of the 20s than anywhere in life, and that the fruitability of women with 28, and that the cave of their heights, and that's going to complicated.
So in the 20s, you should be farming about the body and the own possibilities.
If we think about the development of a child, we all know that the first five years for language and education in the brain.
It's time, the time, in the same time, all the time, all of the future of life.
But we hear about it, we hear about that there's something like adults, and our 20s are approaches, and our 20s.
But that's not going to hear people in the 20s.
The press is talking about time, the pression of adults.
Scientists called 20s, they called the 20s.
Journalists think about thumbs, for people in the 20s, like "Twixters" or "Twixters" or "Cident-Erweks.
That's true.
As a culture, we have the trivialized now that's decide the adult decade.
Leonard Bernstein was that big things with a plan and something too little time, and something too little time.
Doesn't it?
So what happens when you go to the 20s, if you're going to go to the 20s and says, "You're going to get to do something out of your life?"
Nothing.
This person is the atmbition and the drawing and the drawing.
And so every day, every day intelligence, interesting people in the 20s, or like your books, like your books and tell me in my office and say, "I know, I don't know, but I don't do that, but this relationship. I don't count the time."
Or they say, "All say, "All I made it with 30 years, I've made it all good."
But later, it's like, "My 20s are almost 20s, and I don't have anything.
I had a better life, when I was just a better life, when I had just done."
And then it turns out to be like, "In my 20s, partners was partnership like Jerusalem.
All of them, and then everyone, but then the music, and then the music, and then everybody started to start out and everybody started to start out.
I didn't want to be the only one who stayed my husband, I think I've got my husband, because he was in my 30s."
Where are the people in the 20s?
Power doesn't.
OK, that's just said, but it doesn't make a mistake, because it's about very much.
If a lot of experienced about 30s, there's a huge pressure, there's a career to start a career, a city, a city, a partner and two or three kids and two or three kids and two or three kids.
Many of these things are incompatible and how researchers now show you now, and stressful as a stress of this stress, and stressed in the 30s.
The Post-Millenniums millennia crisisisis, not to buy a red laws.
It means that you can do the career that you can do, not doing.
And you're notice that you can't have this child, or the kids or children don't want to give a baby.
A lot of people in the 30s and 40s and 40s, and they say, "What do I thought about 20s? What did I think? What did I think?
I want to change what people do in the 20s and think about 20s.
This is a story that shows how it can go down.
It's the story of ema.
Ema came in my office when she was 25, because she was 25, because she had an identity crisisis.
She said she would like to work in the area of arts or in the field or in the engineering, but she wouldn't have anything, so she would have been done in the last few years.
Because that was cheaper, she lived together with her friends who were left his temperament than his embitions.
And even though they were hard, their years, their years before.
She often often in the situation, but then she said, "You can't look like, "You can't look like you're not looking for your friends.
One day, a day, Ema, and I'd never starting to long.
She had a book, she bought a book, and she spent all the morning, and they spent a lot of contacts, but then she stronger came up with the words that came up with the words.
She was almost hysteric, and she said, "Who will be a car accident?
Who will be worrying about cancer?"
In the moment, I had to tell me, I had to say, "I'm not to say, "I'm going to say, "I'm going to say, "I have to say, "I have to say, "I have to say, "I have to say, "I have to say, "I have together.
But ema didn't need to be therapist who really care about them.
Ema, a better life, and I knew, and I knew that was her chance.
I had been a very first patient Alex too much of it, too much of it, just to look like Emas, like Emas, like emade decades.
In the next weeks and months, I gave ema, I had three rather than Myear-old, whether man or woman, or woman,
First, I told ema, I didn't have identity crisis, they would have a lot of identity crisisis.
And I mean, I would look for this, they would go to look forward.
Power something that's an investment is investment investment in something that you want to be next.
I didn't know about emasy to do anything, and no one knows how the future of the future of the works. But I know, Identity, but Identity capital.
So now the time for this international job, this practicing, this practices that you wanted to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do that.
I'm not smart to countries here, but I'm not counting the 20s who are not counting, but also not counting.
This is procastination.
I said to Ema: He's working, but what makes out there.
Second, I said, "Oh, I said, "the Sipply.
Good friends are primate to get to the airport, but 20s, 20s who are high-happing with people who are, like they know how they're going to know what they're knowing what they're talking about how they're talking about how they're talking about how they're talking about how they're working.
This new person to the new person to the new person to the terms of the exception of your own environment.
And new things are made of such a lot of friends," which is from friends of friends of friends of friends.
It's true: The half of the 20s is undermined or even not business.
But the other half of the other half the other half of stage, they've got there.
The half of jobs are never been made out of jobs. So if you contact the head of your neighbors, you're not making a job.
That's not a bed. That's not a bedroadcasts.
The last rather: Ema believed that you couldn't look like the family, but the friends.
This is true for them as they were looking at them, but as 20s, they would look for her own family, if they looked for a partner, if they were looking for a partner, and a partner.
I said, the time, a new family, a new family.
You might think it's going to think that it's better than 30, and I'm going to be a 25, and I'm going to be voice.
But someone who you sleep in your life, or lives, or lives, or lives, if everyone on Facebook is not a progress.
The best time to planning your marriage, is to be a hand, and that means a handle, and that means to be as you go to be as you can do in your work.
Europe you look at the family means that, and you want to look at what you want to look at what you want to do, and not because it works, or with someone who has been looking at the time.
So what happened to ema?
We went through their address book, and she found the middle of a cousine who worked in a different state in a museum in a museum.
This weakness band, you're going to get there.
This works on the workforce of working their friend who lived their friend who lived to leave her friend who lived.
Now, five years later, it's event-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-ol
It's got a man who's been aware of.
It loves their new career and their new family, and she sands me a map of me, "Well, the cartily, the cells, "Take it's not enough."
Emas story is sounds like this, it would be easy. But that's what I love in 20-year-old.
It's so easy to help them.
20-year-olds are like starting airplane, the plane, and they're just leave the west and wests.
And so after the start can make a small course, whether you can do in Alaska or in Alaska or in Fidschi.
That's the same thing for 21-year-olds, 29-year-old conversation, a great conversation, a great expectancy, a huge impact on years, even more than years, even more than years, even over years, even more than just coming upon.
This is an idea that all 20s that all 20s, who knows to be.
It's so easy to Alex said to Alex.
I have the privilege, this 20s, like Ema, every day, the 30s, the 30s, the 30s, you're not going to give you a identity capital, you're looking for yourself.
Defined you don't know what you didn't know what you didn't know.
You know, you're going to be talking about your life.
Thank you very much.
In the entire computer story, it was always our goal, and our goal information between us and digital information between our physical world and the lights between our physical world and the world, where we can experience our physical world.
And this is smaller, smaller, smaller, and now it's smaller than a billion, and now he's a billion human beings, and computers are become achievable for everyone.
But I asked myself, how it would be if it wasn't a border.
I was introduced how this would look like this.
First, I developed this tool that tool that tools into digital world, so if you're going to be strong, so if you're going to turn it into the physical figures.
Designers can be so directly in 3D materializing and chirtual organizing surgeon,
So with this tools, the borders.
But our hands are still still outside of the screen.
How can we interact with the digital information with the digital information and use the whole starts to use the whole stand up?
In Microsoft Appled Sciences, I've been together with my mentor Cati Boulanger, and a small space about the computer and a small space about the tastatures in a digital workplace.
And that's a transparent screen and depth of fingers and depth of fingers and face, you can now be combined by the tastatures of the tastature, you can now be in the three-dimensels and Pixels with the blocks.
And there's a position in fact, and you can actually have a position in fact, you can choose it as you can choose a book from a rule.
And then you can see through this book, and you can see the books and words and words. All of this virtual touchpads.
Architects can stretch the models can stretch the two hands.
So in these two examples, we're going to be in the digital world.
But how if we were to turn the whole thing, and the digital information, and the digital information?
Sure many of you have made a lot of you have done to buy article online, article online.
But now you have to do anymore.
Here I have an "Online-Amy ancient cabin.
This view of view, you get through a head, you're involved or by the system, if the system of our body, if the system of our body.
And this idea of leadership, I started thinking about it, I started to see the pixel, but they can feel physical, so we can feel them physical, and we can feel them.
How would a look like this?
In MIT MIT Media Lab, Ishi Ishi Ishi Ishi and my membershi Pixel Pixel.
Well, in this case, this case, this round magnet like a three-dimensional pixel in our world. That means that both computers, and that means that we can move this object, and inside this smaller, at least 3D.
Effective, we have the hardwork, and control the movement, and control the movement by magnetic levitation, mechanical levitation, and that requires.
In the object of digital programming, we're going to be able to do it from space and time, we can get human movements, and time, again, and then you're going to be recorded and during the real world.
So, like this. Choreographies are taught about white distance or Michael Jordans, or Michael Jordans, and again and again and again.
Students can use this, to use complex concepts like planets like planets and physics and physics, and other than computers, and textbooks or textbooks or textbooks, and they're very remarkable experience and powerful experience, and they're really powerful ex
And then, more exciting than just what we've got to moment, to materialize the computer, it's the programming the programming of the world is actually going to change our data.
As you can't be digital information, but not only something that we don't just begin to interact with us, as part of our physical environment, without our physical environment, without our real world.
Today, we started talking about the borders, but if we talked about the borders, but if we're going to be the only borders.
Thank you very much.
I was trained two years to be trained to be a turner, China, China, China, China, China,
When I was in the first class, I wanted to send me to a school for a school for athletal, all the uncost.
But my mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to be engineering engineering.
After they had the culture of culture, they believed that the only way they were survived to be sure that the only way to be safe and well, and well,
It's not important to see if I don't like.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opernina.
This is me, I'm in my maginary clavier.
One operns of a must be very early with the acrobatics, so I tried to go to the open-training.
I even wrote the shoes on the shoes and the moderator and moderator of a radioshow.
But the adults are not my idea of my idea.
The adults are not believed that it was serious.
Only my friends are also supporting me, but they were just children, just as I was just as I made myself.
And with 15 years, I knew that I was too old to still with the training.
So my dream would never be true.
I had afraid of my life, I had a lucky of my life, I could only make a happiness choice.
But that's even more unexpected.
So I had to find my head, I had a different task.
No one of them to teach me? All right? All right.
So I went to books.
I still had my hunger, I was incredibly still with this book about a writer," and musician and musician.
<unk>"Sanmaosa's Lon's Lessons of Nan Huaijin<unk>" in 1995, I got in 1995, and what I got to read the U.S.
Of course, the books that are brought in China.
"The Great Earth is about the Chinese farmers.
It's just not events as a propaganda.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
But that's a subject of another time.
But that five was a kind of experience, I brought to me, "You should you be your father and your mother."
"Ehre," I thought, "the's so different and much better than Ghoram."
That was my way to focus on the confidence of the confidence and relationship to my parents.
And by the encounter culture, I started with a new culture.
This is a lot of involved a lot of inside.
I found this map, for example, this map, because Chinese students with this one, because Chinese students with this one.
It never came to mean that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
So a map of a map of the personal view of personal view.
And that's not the same leader is not new.
In the academic world, it's a standard carrier.
There are even researching research, like comparison, like compared to compare the same literature of literature.
Compared and opportunity to be a complex understanding of a topic of a topic.
So I thought, if I found myself in the research, why not in the day?
So I started to read two books at the same time.
They can do by people -- <unk>"Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson<unk> <unk>"John Adamson<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk> the same events that were involved in the same events with common experiences.
<unk>"We're printed by Catharine Graham<unk> <unk>"Warren Buffety," and the snowball," by Alice Snoweball, and I'm also going to be the same stories -- "Cing" -- "Cing-year-year-belief.
In Christus, the trials were the attempts, political and spiritual nature.
Buddha, they were all psychological nature: Lust, fear, fear and social plays, interesting.
If you're a stranger, it makes it also fun, it's fun, the favorite books in two languages.
<unk>"Sinfony for a seavogel" of Thomas Merton<unk> <unk>"Der water -- the lifestyle of the Taoism, the Taoism, instead of alan Watt's found out how to do I found out how I could get you.
And by translation is, for example, for example, for example, "Ifortunately," in Chinese lucky," which means "shelle fast.
"Braut" in Chinese means "newhohohohohohoh.
Books are like a magical tor. It's a magical torness, I have a connection of the past.
I never know that I'm going to feel more apparent.
A piece of dream is really nothing in the comparison in comparison.
I'm coming to the translator that it's not the only dream is not the only dream.
His important dreams is to bring us to the touching us where dreams come from dreams where our passion and our passion and our lucky and our happiness.
Even a cergarten dreams can make this dream.
Because books, I'm happy today, again, again with a sense of life and clearly mastery.
Well, books are always being with you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
When I was 8 years old, a new girl in the class, and she was so expressed as new girls, and she was always seem to be.
She had longer longer hair, and a little lowerful small lower, and in geography and in the bookstaby and in the book.
In some school, I running a text message, until I had a team of a team.
So I stayed one day, I stayed a day, much longer, and I stopped me in the girls,
When the air, I was coming out of the air, I got took me to classroom and took me the nodes of teacher.
And then I did.
If you had the nodes of my rivalin, just a few people.
All of a series.
When I wanted to return the book, I fell told me that some of my other classrooms had pretty good nodes.
So I corrigated in the effects of the nodes, all the nodes, without fantasy.
I gave all fours, and I gave another, because I was also application.
I'm still used to behavior.
I don't understand where the idea where the idea.
I don't understand why I felt so well.
I felt really good.
I don't understand why I never missed.
It was so obvious.
I never got awesome.
But most of the most amazing me: Why did it so much that this little girls me so well, so well,
Eifer trials me.
It's so deeply secretary.
We know that babies are babies in the babies.
And as Primates. Hutts are making nature from nature.
We know that Eiferation of the main for Mord under electricity in the United States.
But I never read a study that could read their insightness, their long lifetimes or their long-controlled nerves.
And we have to be able to turn to the literature, because the lab, the lab, the lab, the lab, in all their possible forms of their possible forms.
Is it a translative to say that if we had no eaper, if we had no literature?
So no untility, no until you don't have "Odyssee."
No effective king, no, no "Attuer from 1001 night.
No Shakespeare.
And there's the leaders of the United States, because we lose the losing, "Shall and watchall and Wahn," "Madam Bovary," "Madam Bovary," "Madama Karenina.
No personal person, no proust. I know that it's come to say that Proust is to say that Proust, but in puncto Eifer, but in puncto Eifer.
This year, we celebrate the 200. Jubilum's "An the search of the search for the lost time," and his green time, and his green time, and the normal chains of sexual weather have hope.
So let's think about proust that we think about emotion.
We think about the little boy who trying to sleep.
We think of a piece of cake, in Lavendel Teee.
We forget how radiation was radiation.
We forget how he's available.
These kind of books are for Virginia Woolful figure as Katzingarm.
I don't know how Katzingarm, but we say, it's a pressure.
Let's look at why the Roman and the effects, and the effects and proustroustroust as well.
Is it so obvious that effects, reduced on person -- reduced a fundamental reduced basically?
I don't know. I think it's just hard to the pain, because you think about what happens when we think about what happens when we're really sure what happens when we're really sure.
If we're really sure, we tell us a story.
Tell us ourselves stories about life of other people and they're doing that it's badly bad because they're so focused that it's badly bad.
As a narrator of the story, and we know what the audience, and we need to stop the message to still the ripping. Ripping. Ripping.
Eifer trying to Amateur rooman, and we can look like this, and so it can be made out of the proustrouster.
In the first band, "In Swanns," and I love the roman Roman Roman, one of the protagonists, because of the protagonists, and as great as great as well, and as great, and as a sudden, and so they're a sentences.
Everything they're ready to me and what I could also ready to someone else, maybe even in this moment."
That's the story that he tells he tells, and from there, and from its money, that Swanning every new retirement that he discovered in his money, to be in his private following in his private following following following.
We have to admit that Swann and Proust Norian and proustically.
Prousts friends had to leave the country, if they want to do with him.
But you don't have to be simple, you have to be a single trees that it's hard work. Right?
Eiferation is experienced.
It's a hungry that must be dangerous feeling.
What does the effective?
Eiferation magazine.
Eiferation maybe details.
Eiferation may be long long longer hair and small lowerful sharks.
Eiferation magic.
That's why instagram is also successful.
In basically, Proust of science and the language of science and the effects.
When Swanny, if Swanner, suddenly, suddenly, and the services, and the services of his money, he made this behavior.
He says, "You might think that's abstracting, but it's nothing other, but it's nothing to look at interpreting a thinking of antible text."
He says, "It's scientific intellectual intellectual value."
Proust trying to show you that Eifer trying to look at us, and we're looking at the old day, but in their core, it's a search for knowledge, and what's painful truth, and what's going to be painful.
Cummer, Dembroust -- that's for proust of Proust of the way to wisdom.
He says, "A woman we need to be suffering us that we need to be a bigger and bigger and bread and bread and bread, and breadly, and we're interested in the genius of a man who's interested in us."
Says it's about this, we should look for us?
No. I think he's trying to tell us that Eifer's trying to tell us something about ourselves.
Is there a different sense of opening us to this particular way?
Enthetically, someone else emotion, our aggression, our attacks, our attacks?
And teaches us any other sense of the same feelings like this?
Freudy should write about it.
One day, Freudied by a very best young man who was looking at the thought of the idea that he was considered to be a wife.
And Freud says, this man is kind of guy is kind of strange, because he doesn't even goes out.
Because they're innocent, and everyone knows it.
The poor creature is basically undermined.
Instead, he looks at things that he looks like things that he's noticed to think, so independent behavior.
Smile it's too much or still you together with a man together?
<unk>Freud<unk>Freudent saying that the hutter of the unconsciousness.
The Roman is very well in this point.
The Roman is very well, like Eifer's trying to look at us, but not exactly intensive, but not exactly what's not exactly.
Because the more effective, the more we're, the more fantasies.
So I think that effects us to do that efforts us to do violent or illegal things.
Eifer trying to be lose to be very invention.
And I think about 8 years, I think about 8 years, but I think about the story that I've heard in the news.
A 52-year-old woman from Michigan, because they were made by a self-year-old false Facebook-Acount, wrong, written incredible news.
A whole year.
She tried to went to went to write their ex-friends in school, and I listened to the shoes, I was reacting with reaction.
Because. Let's be honest.
What if there was a bigger, if you're deplace, creativity. Right?
This is something from a Roman.
This is something from a Roman of Patricia Highsmith.
Highsmith is one of my favorite state.
It's the brilliant woman's most of American literature.
From her, "Two foreign might be talent and "Talent Mr. Ripley," and everything books that can be used to do with what Eifer, and we're using our minds, and we're going to be in the mind, and what we're doing in the membrane, which is in the membrane
Let's take Tom Ripley, their figure.
First, first, Tom Ripley you have, and you have, and you've got, and you're like from the Earth, and you're like from the Earth. He reacts on your name, he's going to tell your bank accounts your bank accounts.
This is a way of doing.
But what should we do? We can't do it? We can't do.
I can't give you all the world, even if I would like to do it.
It's a shore, because we live in a neurons in a neurons.
We live in a "eifering smaller."
We're all good citizens of the social media, where the durrency. Right?
Are you the roman's the outside of the evidence.
But we do, what Characters do when they're not sure if they're not sure you're not sure.
Let's go to 221 bacters and asking for Sherlock Holmes.
Think about Holmes, they think about Holmesis as a professor Moriarty, this genius, this genius.
But I always liked to <unk>Lestrade, the head of Scotland Yard with the face of a rat, the Holmes, the Holmes, the Holmes, but it takes him, but it takes him.
That's so crazy.
So lestrating his help, it takes its helps him, and it's going to be able to do this stories.
But when they work together, it starts to change something, and finally, and finally in "The six Napoleon," and all of the solution, and all of the solution, and says, "We're not news and says, "We're not news.
We're proud of you."
And he's not going to be in Scotland Yard, Jard, who wouldn't want to protect Holmes didn't want to protect the hand.
This is one of the few times that we're going to see holmes in his stories, and I find this little scene, but also I think this little scene, but also the secretary.
It seems like a sixthy emotional, but a physical problem.
In a moment is holm is holmed on another waves like lestries.
And in the next moment, they're on a waves.
Suddenly, it's leaders to require this genius, that he's been used to do that.
Is it really simple?
What if Eifer if Eifer is really just a physical problem would be a physical problem? If we were just about how we do with the other in relationship with the other in relationship?
Maybe we wouldn't want to take someone excellent.
We could be able to each other.
But I like Notfall plans.
While we waited, we still have the literature as trost.
Literature alone alone, the effects.
Literature, she can pick them, it can be a bit of it.
And who's all come together, the good lestrade, the fear of tom Ripley, the crazy, Marcel Proustery, Marcel Proust itself.
We're in excellent society.
Thank you very much.
I was about 10 years old and on a camping-year-year-father in the Adirondack Gebird, a wild father in the northern part of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest is function.
The sun is the boards like the boards like this, and if there was no path, and if there was no path, you would have been able to take the first people who were going through these forest people who were going through these forest people who were going through this forest people who would go through these forest people who were going through this forest.
We came to our tental place.
I saw the little hut, and I looked at a cliff and blicked over a crystal crystal grade, wonderful sea,
And then the roof was a mothers, maybe 4 percent of the drops, with Apple core, with Apple core, and ageballter aluminiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminiuminiumin.
I was amazing, I was amazing and I was missing.
The tenthoods were too lazy to make away from what they thought they were, who, who, who would they thought, would they thought?
The question is, and I fell in my mind.
Who is it going to look at us?
How do you think about who is, or where the "uns" also behind us who spaces us in Istanbul?
Who is it going down in Rio on Rio?
Here in New York Rumta is about 11,000 tons of every day, about 11,000 tons of mills of mills and 2,000 tons of tons of recycling sun.
I wanted to know them -- as individuals.
I wanted to understand who makes the job.
How is it to wear a uniform and wearing this citizens?
So I started a research project with them.
I went through the lashing went down the route, and I was interviewed people in Books and Anlagen in the whole city. I was a lot of still, but I was still a lot of eye, but I was still an outside.
I had to go deeper.
So I took a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as a job as
I don't just walking with the lashing. I went to the lashing.
And I report the mechanical best and plants and plants.
It was a remarkable privileged privilege, and an experience.
Each one is, everyone asks for the idea.
He's not that, but not as present, and you think about days, and you're really bad, you know, you're really badly fast.
And you have the weight, you're just hard to be hard.
I know people who were made this jobs. The more years. The body has been stilled to the weight, and they still saw their body, tons of mills, tons of mills.
And then there's the danger.
After statistics of working ministry is the profession in the city of the city in the city of the 10 dangerous jobs in the country. And I learned why.
You're all day in the traffic, everything, everything.
All of them want to predict the cars are not enough to drive the car.
That's really bad for the workers.
And the garbage itself is full of Gife, the mills of the mills and terrible.
I also learned about the inevitability of the mouth.
If you go from the board of the mountain, and from the back of the mills of the city, you see that garbage, you can see that mills itself.
He doesn't stopped to be able to get.
It's also like a kind of attention or circulation.
He has to be always have to be in movement.
And then there's the stigma.
You're going to be invisible, and you're going to be a basically -- wish, because you're going to be blocked with the waiting or a pause of their lives, or a coffeeee, or a coffeeeeee, and they're going to come in and they say that and they're going to come to coming to com
I think this stigma particularly ironic, because I think that the middle of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city.
They're the growth of public health.
If they didn't remove all day, efficient and efficient and efficient, and he would be connected by the treatment, and they would be borrowing us to very regular ways.
Disease that we had been since for decades and centuries, and centuries, and we would be able to turn us and we'd be shadowed us.
The economy needs.
If we can't get the old crammed, we don't have a place for the new. The motors of economy, if the consumption of consumption.
I don't do the capitalism, I just went out to the way.
And then this is what I call our average, which is what I call ourselves, all sorts of speed.
And I mean, I just like fast, we're used today.
We don't care about our coffeeeeeeeeee, our pockets or our pockets or our water bottle, or to repairs, or water.
We take them off, they're going to forget, because we know that there are people on the other side, and we know that there are people on the other side.
So I want to talk today, I want to think about city today, how we think about city to make the stigma to improve the stigma, and they can make them into this entertainment, and human.
Their work, I think, this is kind of liturgic.
You see the streets of every day, regularly.
They're wearing in many cities.
You know when you can expect them.
And their work is our work is our work.
They're like a background.
The definitely that they stopped us, holds us, holds us, ourselves, ourselves, and that's always have to stop the definitely to stop every price.
At the days after the 11, I heard the Donner of a mountain, I heard the street, basically, basically, and I called the treporate, and he got a man who was a man who was a man who went on his paper recycledge, like every time he went out howekycycycy
And I tried to thank him for his work -- at this days -- at this days, but I started to know, I started to win.
And he looked at me and said, "All, and he said, "All right.
"All right,"
First, I started my mind, I started my minds about city, and I met the man.
His name is Paulie, and we're often working together, we were good friends.
I wanted to believe that Paulieie.
Everything is good.
But in our efforts, the way we change the way we're going to change the way we have to look at this planet, we have to look at all the cost of the cost of the work.
And we have to be able to do the people who are going to be able to do the work, and we can do together, and how we can think about how we can do systems around us, and we can developments that are going to be remarkable to the streets of the last few years of the last few years, which is a remarkable four years, what is a re
Cities, if we talk about what we think about millennia, if we talk about millennia, three percent of the national Aball strumble.
It's a remarkable statistics.
In your eye, in your life, in your life when you see the next time you see the next time you see the next time you see a moment, you're going to take a moment, you're true a moment.
Take a moment, you know, to meet.
Hello TEDWomen, what's going on?

Many people don't walking with CP, but my parents don't believed in a "kn't believed in a "cannot."
The Mantraraph of my father was, "Yes, you can do that! You can do that! You can do that."
So if my three older sisters wish, I wished, I wished.
If my three older sisters on a public school sisters, my parents, my parents, so I could go to the school system, and if we didn't get all the parents, and if we all got the potato, we all got the panels.
My father brought me the running was five by five, by food, and he food on his feet.
Another one of his data was a dollars, a dollars before my nose to my nose.
My inner strong strong, and as -- Ja. So, and as -- Yes. So I found like a champion that I had a champion that had a champion that had a champion that had a champion that had a champion that had a champion that had come too much.
At the time, there was only six Araber in my city, and all of my family.
Today, we have 20 Araber in the city, and they're still all my family.
I think no one has ever been done that we're not a Italians.
That was the 11. September, and before politicians, and before politicians, "I hate Moslems" as a choice.
People who I grew up with my faith, no problem with my faith.
But they were able to be able to ramadan, maybe I could be related.
I explained them that I could live from my body father, so I could live, so fasters of suns of suns of sunship to --

Yes, the Broadway. Total.
My parents couldn't a physiotherapy box, so they sent me to dance me to dance.
I learned how to do you dance, so I can go to Abs.
And I'm from Jersey, where it's really important to be chicism, so if my friends, then I'm also.
And if my friends were brought their summer focus on the coast of Jersey, I didn't.
I spent my summer in a war in a war, because my parents had afraid of my parents, if we didn't get any summer to Palestina, after Palestina.
The summer fatheries often wanted to be cured me to be milked me to be milk by Hirs, so I was brought in the top of the water, and I know how the water, and I know how the water, and I thought, "I know, I thought, "I'm going to working.
But one wonderful thing we found: Yoga.
I have to say it's really boring, but before I did Yoga, I was a stand-up Comedian who can't even stand-up Comedian who can't even stand-up Comedian who can't even stand-up Comedian who wasn't even stand-up Comedian wholeary.
Now, I can also stand up on the head.
My parents blood me to all of me, I'd be able to all of this in the case wasn't impossible, and my dream, and my dreams, and my dream.
On the fundamental minority of minority, I got a great stuff, the Arizona State University, because I was crating every minority, because I'm going to drive every minority.
I was just the house of the challenge of challenge.
All of them.
I was all the homeworks of the homeworks, I got all my course, I got in all of my course, and I got in all their course.
Every time I played a scene from "The Glass magery" and sleeping my teacher.
But I never got a role.
In my degree-year-olds, the ASU., the ASU.S.
A piece of a girl with CP.
I was a girl with CP.
So I was, I got everywhere, I get a role.
I have cerebral paris!
And free! It's free!
God is, thank you, I'm finally free!"
I didn't get the role.
Sherry Brown.
I called the line of the challenge of the challenge, I had hysteric, I would have a hysterically, and she said, "You know why. She said, "I'd say she was not going to be the stunt.
I said, "It's not going to be the stunts, but if I can't do it."
I was born took this role for this role, and they gave a challenge, and they gave a couple of CP.
The university in the quote life.
Hollywood is, he's awood is known for this, body's healthy challenge game body.
After the degree, I moved home. My first role was a statist.
My dream was true.
And I knew I knew I was bald by the Restaurant," to "crazy friends.
But instead, I stayed a glorified piece of piece that was only at the back of the back of the back of the back of the background that Casting Directors don't have a locker-flocker-flocker-flocker players.
They just put people perfect people perfect people.
But for exceptions, the rule.
I grew up with Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr and Ellen, and all of these women had common: they were common.
So I was comic.
My first job was told, it was, it was a memory of New York City to Shows in New York City to Shows, and I'm going to leave the first comic, and I'm going to be after him, when he was expecting on a street with a massive to Jersey in New York
I'm in Clubs all over the U.S., I also made Shows in the Middle East, uncomfortable, uncomfortable, unexpected and unexpected.
Some people say, I'm the first comics in Arab world.
I don't like to be the first, but I know that they've never heard of the bad small generally, and they're not small generally comic.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean Obeidallah, and I was with the New Yorker Arabic Comedy festival, which is now already festival, which is now festival that now.
Our goal was to change the negative picture of Arabicans and change in the media, and to change the media and to remember that South Arabia and Arabia and Arabia and Arabia and Arabia.
The same thing of Araberning was much easier than the challenge, much easier to get the stigma of the terms of the terms of the terms.
My big distriction was 2010.
I was as a gast in the message of Countdown in Keith Olbermann" in Keith Olbermann"
I came like to the degree ball, I remember, they were going to set me in a studio and sat down to a three chair.
So I looked at the stage, and I said, "It's going to get a different chair, can I get another chair?"
And she looked at me and said, "Five, four, four, four, two ...
And we were live!
So I had to table me on the table of the gast, so I had to red during the scene of scene, and when the interview, and as the interview, I was outside, I was outside.
And I was my chance, and I had been trying to do, and I never knew that launched me.
But Mr. Olbermann ludge me to a full time, but I made me a full-mit worker and small boy.
In the work with Keith Olbermanner learned something to do with Keith Olberman, all humans in the Internet.
People say, kids are gray, but as a children or adults have made a funny about me.
In World Wide Web, I'm suddenly volume,
If I look atline videos, I see comments, I see comments like, "Ey, how do you see the same thing?"
"Ey, the first one is the first?"
And my favorit: "Aroritipping Terrorist.
Do they have ne disease?
We should be praying."
One of them even smart, my terms of decline, credits: Drehbook, comics, comics, corin, cerebral paris.
A terms of a careful as the heart.
If a role of a role of anotheronc<unk> playing Beyonc<unk>, can't play a role.
The types are the biggest -- Yes. That's an applause.
People with terms of minority in the world, and we're the biggest in the world, and we're the business.
The doctors said, I could never walk up here, but I could never sitting here.
But I would be adults with social media, I wouldn't be here.
I hope that we can create a positive positive picture of terms and in the media and in the media.
Maybe it's less hass in the Internet, if it's more positive idea.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it takes a village to require a child.
My journey with environment, I brought me a few very special places.
I was in the red line of the red line of Seifenopern Susan Luci and the iconic lorraine Arbus.
I was in a movie, I'm going to play with Adam Sandler, and with my idol, who worked with my idol, working with my idol.
I'm a main reading with the comedy Tour "Arabs Gone Wild" around the world.
I was representing the big basically New Jersey in Democratic National Committee 2008.
I've been called "Maysoon's Kids," a wealthy United States, palestinian flights, palestinian flights to give me the breakdowns.
But the one moment that most of the most exactly -- before this one -- the moment that's most of the moment that was the most flying out of the man on the man on the man who is like a box, and like a bee, and as a bee, and as I said, and as I got told you, and as I said, "Muppymettleday,
That was the only time that my father ever saw a live a live of my father's watching this talk.
: Mays your souls your soul, Papa. My name is Maysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon, you can do that."
There was a time where we have a big problems.
At 21. Juli in 1969, Juli in 1969, Aldrin from Mola, 11 and stood up to the ocean, and stopped up to the ocean.
Armstrong and Aldrin, but their present, but their present moldobers of a major moon was the height of a community, community.
The Apollo programm was the largest peacebuilding mobilization in the United States of America.
To get to the moon to Molas, investment, NASA, about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the bundament of the bundament of the bundes.
Apollocted workplaces for 400,000 people and he was working together, and they worked by 20,000 companies, universities and tests.
People died of the best way, the best of the apollo 1.
But until the end of the Apollo programms of 24 people to Molas.
From the second one that's surface, the surface of Armstrin, Aldrin, now the last year, now the oldrong year, now the older year.
But why did they go?
They didn't have much back: 380 kilograms, and something that all 24 later, and something that all 24 later, a new sense of what we're doing is small and tiny.
Why did they went? Zynically went to show that president Kennedynic Kennedy, who wanted to show that his nation has been the better rockets.
But Kennedy's own words of the Rice University University of the Rice University.
For the time, Apollocted by the West, the West, the West, the east war.
At the time, the most strongest feeling of the first feeling of the amazing causes of technology.
They flew up to Molas, because it was a great thing.
The moon of the moon, the moon of a long series of a long-tery triump.
For the first half of the 20th century, the flying, and the flight, and the airplane, Penicillin and an immediately.
In the middle of the century, and the polio, and the pocks.
Technology seemed to have something called Alvin Toffler in 1970, a "believince."
For the greatest part of the human history, we couldn't faster than a boat, or a boat with segules, but in 1969, the mankindship of the Apollocted 10 with a speed of about 10,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970, no human beings in 1970.
Nobody has ever moved to move the best way to faster than the best optimisms, and the unknown optimism about the power of technology is fighting with technology, because the big problems that we had to fly to fly to the marvelopment, for example, for example, for example, for ex
I remember how I remember when I was a five-year-olds.
The advice of the Apollo 17, and my mother was not too much in the celebrate experience of Saturn-Raketech.
I had a clue that this was the last moonmission, but I was going to be hundreds of mission, I was going to be in my life.
The example, "etwhatwhatting with our ability to solve with technology," is to a platform.
You hear it all over the place.
We've heard this in the last two days at TED.
It's a preced technologists had a technologists, and even with the longer with the targets, and with things like iPhonees and Apps and Apps and Apps and Apps and Apps, or algorithms, or algorithms.
It's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have longer lives, and they're regarded our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happens?
There's a bigger explanation from the Silicon Valley, where you were less likely to be less embrace the last time in the years, in the years, in the years, Microsoft, Apple and gene.
In Silicon Valley says, the markets would be the markets, in the best, which risks, which risks the companies.
Silicon Valley says that risks are moved from it, or even moved by changing ideas, and instead of studying ideas or even instead, and instead of problems or even explored problems or even experiences.
But this explanation is not good enough.
It's mainly explaining what happens to Silicon Valley not true.
Even to their risk of their risks against risks against risks ago. Winzy investments with a excited investments within 10 years.
Investors, always been mothers, rentabulous problems like energy, which is a huge enormous property, and the development, and the development, and the risk and risk, and the risk of the development of technology, never development of technology.
No, the reasons why we can't solve problems are complicated and deeply complicated.
Sometimes we decide, we don't know the big problems.
We could fly fly to the Mars, if we want to fly.
NASA has actually designed a plan.
But to the Mars to fly a political decision of political decision of public believed, and so that's why it's never going to happen.
We're not going to fly because everyone thinks that there are important to the Earth, there are more important things that have to be done.
Another time, we can't solve the big problems because our political systems.
Today, less than two percent of the energy consumption of the Earth's recognize, like solar sources, like solar power than two percent, less than two percent, and the reason we're reason we's reason.
Coal and supportive, coal, more famous than solar energy and wind and wind and wind and wind and earth.
We all want to all alternative energy cells that are not existing. But it doesn't exist.
Now, it's so that developers, companies, companies and economists in the principles of the same minds and international practices and international practices and international practices.
But in the time, in the moment of political climate that the energy politics of the U.S. or the international departments, and then they're going to be recorded and recorded to record the U.S.
Sometimes are deeply problems that are not solved in technological, but not that.
It was long, it was hungry that hungry is hunger at the middle of life.
But 30 years, three years, we've taught us that hunger political crisises are catastrophic catastrophic disasters.
Technologies can be things like he could make things like lagers, like camports of life, but it will be improve the hunger, but it's going to be hunger, you're going to be hunger.
And then, sometimes, sometimes the solutions are not really understanding the problems, because we don't really understand the problems.
President Nixon, we're going to explain the war, but you're going to find out that there are many species of cancer, and you're going to be crazy, most of the case of the therapy, and it's been realized for the last 10 years, and he seems to be realized the last 10 years, and it seem
Swhile problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve with technologies.
We can have to be, but we have to be able to do this four elements: leaderships and the politicians and the publics, a problem, a problem, institutions, institutions, and we need to be able to understand it.
The apollomission that was a kind of metaphor of technology, the ability to solve this criteria, they filled these criteria.
But this is a model that can be repeated in the future.
It's not the year 1961.
There's no dramatically dramatically like the cold war, no politicians like John Kennedy, who's all difficult and dangerous and dangerous and dangerous and dangerous systems like the Science fiction-mythology.
But at the end of all, it was just to fly, it was just to fly.
He was just three days.
And it's kind of course, whether this is a serious problem.
We're in ourselves, and we're going to be harder to be harder to be harder to be difficult.
White God knows it's not missing everyone's not in challenges.
Thank you very much.
I want to close you to close your eyes.
Imagine you're standing your hands.
Betray the door, their color, and the material that she's made.
Now, you're going to put a group of FK classes on their vehicles on their drivers.
It's a naked bicycle, and they come up and you get your car.
You have to imagine that really need to imagine.
They struggle, they sweat and waiting directly on you.
And then they all crawls all right into your mainstorms.
Fridge, rains, everything, everything, and signs.
Now, you know about the swell of your apartment in your apartment in your flures, your flures, your river, your living on the other side of your living, and enjoying the light.
The light seems to be the crime monster.
It's wins out of a yellow of a yellow path.
And a bit of a bit of a box.
You can feel almost fill you feel like his blue fellow your nose.
You call the chococokecoke covers that it's going to be.
And I think of him, in your living room.
Here's your performance with all the performance of your imagination of Britney Spears.
Their kids are just the most covers all the most farmers, she sings "Hit More Time Baby One More Time," as they go to your living room.
Now, I'm going to follow my kitchen.
The ground was replaced by a yellow plasted plastic and out of your oven, and from your oven, the cy, the tiny, birds and the lions of "The At the lions of Oz" and the car.
Okay. Now, opening the eyes.
I want to tell you about a very bizarre weather bizarre weather every year in New York City,
It's called "United States Memory Championhip."
A few years ago, I wanted to do this weather than science as science as science, and he expecting the year, and he expecting the same year.
It was a bunch of guys and some of the guy, and some of the whole age, and Hygiens and Hygiented.
They were presented to after a bed dogs of bed hands.
And learned the name of dozens and dozens of unknowns of unknown.
And I realized all the poems in just a few minutes.
They concerned about who were able to return the range of a giant cards in the fastest,
That's crazy.
These people have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to do that.
I started to stop me with some of them.
This is Ed Cook, a guy who come out of England, and there's one of the part of the part of the part of the memory.
And I asked him, "Ed, when you've noticed that you've got this particular remarkable?
And Ed said, "I'm not an island.
I just got average memory.
Everyone who's going to be here, you will be a done or she's just average, or she's just average.
We all have told us all of using technology, and we trained to fully, and that incredible memory.
And I just thought, "Wow, how comes from this?
We stood outside of the weather of the weather, and Ed, and Ed, this beautiful, brilliant guy says, "Josh, you're a guy who says, "Journalist.
Do you know Britney Spears?"
I said, "What? New?
"I'd like to teach Britney Spears, like to teach the range of a giant cards of a gift of a gift.
It would be moving the world that can move everyone can be here."
I said, "I'm not Britney Spears, but you could teach me.
I mean, you have to start somewhere, right?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
A great majority of the next year, I didn't just spend my memory, but also to study it, but also to understand it, and understand why it works, why it works, and what it might be working and what it might be potential.
I've actually met a lot of interesting people.
This is the example E.P.
He's sorrying memory, and he's probably the bad memory of the world.
His poems is so bad that he doesn't even remember his memory problem. What's amazing.
Although it was so tragic, he was a memory of how much of our memory, how much of our memory, who we are.
On the other side of the spectrum, I learned.
Cim Peks.
He was the previous hope for dustin Hoffmans Character in the movie."
We spent a middle-day, we spent afternoon in the public books in Salt Lake City Telephone books.
And I came back to the whole stacks of stacks about the memory about the memory, Abhandles, Abhandles, and more in Latin and more in Latin and later in Latin and later in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the medital age.
And I've learned a whole bunch of things.
And especially fascinated me that there was a time to train the idea of training the memory to decipline, not nearly to cultivate, not nearly as freezing as free.
There was a time to people investigating investment investment, it was able to do it.
Over the last few years, we have a series of technologies, we have a series of technologies, from Alphabet to the codex, the book pressure, the book pressure that the computer, the computer, the smartphone -- that's always made us feel like this.
These technologies have changed our modern world, but at the same time.
They've changed us, and I would change us, and I would change us that they also have cognitive us.
Without the need to remember the needs, it seems like it's like, we'd have forget about how that.
One of the last places of these Earth, where you can still find people who are still training their memory, they're still cultivate, and cultivate, and cultivate memory.
In fact, it's not as unique, there are competition as this whole world.
And that's what I wanted to know how these people do this.
A few years ago, a research group of London, a group of London a group of memory college of memory.
They wanted to know, you know, or anatomy of their brains or anatomy of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than we do?
They gave them a stack of cognition, and the answer was, and the answer was,
There was a very interesting thing, and there was a lot of difference between the brain of a memory of a memory, and the control of a control.
If you put them in a fMRI machine, and you're looking at their brains, as they're numbers, faces and images of snows and images, you can see that in the brain, you can see that in the brains of the brain.
It seems like they'd like to use the part of their memory, which is used for the spaces that are used for the spaces and Navigate.
Why? And why? And can we learn something about it?
The competition of the best memory is going to be the best memory of a weathered by a sort of weather any year, in the new technology to the faster of technology to the fastest of the fastestrumps of the field of the field of the field.
This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three times more memory.
On the table of table, 36,000 feet cards that he's invented by a technology that he's been invented by a technology that he's been a single.
He used a similar technology to be similar to be the exact same range of 40 to 40 to stopped in a hour.
Yes.
And although there's a big difference to technology to technology, in these weather, based on these weather, but all of these technology, all of these technologychologists called "laborative encoding."
That's what we called baker<unk>Baradox illustrated, this concept is especially elegant. It's like, if I asked two people, If I'm going to see the same word, and I say, "Merk you're a person called "Mer."
That's his name.
And I say, "Merk you, you know, there's a person who is a baker."
So if I go back to you later, you know, you go back to you and say, "You know, you know, what I said, "You know, what I said before?
You know what you're going to be?
The person who should be remembered baker, remembers, remembers, the person who should be remember the person who should be remembered as the person with the bakerber.
Same word, different words, different memory. That's strange.
What's going on here?
Well, the name baker is nothing.
It's absolutely independent of all the memory of all the memory that's in your head.
But the profession of the baker, we know about baker.
Baker's wearing away from the mothers.
Baker's bakers have mistakes.
Baker baker well when they come home from working home.
Maybe we even know a baker.
And if we hear the words, we're going to stop the wordsociations with the word and enables later, and he reconstruction.
The secrets of what's going on in the memory of what's going on in the memory, and the secrets, and the secrets to find out, and to find out of the name of a way to find the name baker to the name baker in the mountains.
One of the extraction of technology can be data back 200 years to the antics.
It was known as the memory of the memory.
The story is, the story is, like, there was a poet called Simonides, which was a fest message.
He was to understand the constantly, because if you wanted to be a really great party shoot, you didn't want to be a determined.
He's carrying his poems out of the memory, and it's the space. In exactly the moment, and the correction is the him.
Not only are all dead, their body are deadly uncomfortable.
Nobody can say who's been applied, no one knows where who's heard.
The body can't be really carefully.
It's a tragedy after the other.
Simonides out there, the only survival survival of these catastrophe. He finally, and he finally, and he suddenly, and he can see that he can see what he's going on inside what he's going on.
And so it takes the links on the hand, and it leads to the trunks.
In this moment, Simonides, something that we all know that we all know that we all know that we all know that we can also know that we can also know that we can also be names, telephone names of our colleagues, we can see a very well-down and space.
If I'm going to ask you to ask you to repeating the first 10 words, so you would find it difficult to find it difficult to find it.
But I bet you would like to remember who would remember who would be in this moment on a moment on a moment on a moment in your foyerd in your foyerd in your foyerd in your foyerd.
The idea of the memory of the memory of the memory of the brain, and it's buildings inside, and it's with images of the memory, bizarre, bizarre, bizarre, bizarre, bizarre, bizarre, the picture, the picture,
This is a rather battle that goes over 2,000 years old latines about 2,000 years old.
So how does it work?
And you're going to be invited to kep a talk to TED has been holding it out of the memory of the memory, just like Cicero, just like Cicero, it would have been done in TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.
You could even go, you could go, you could imagine your hand.
Imagine a absolutely crazy story with unmapped story with unmappy pictures to remember you're not talking about this deadly, you know, you want to talk about this deadly.
And then you go to your house, and they get the crumble monster on the back of Mr. Ed. Ed.
And that would remember that you remember, your friend Ed Cook.
And if you want Britney Spears, you remember, you want to tell you a funny guy who wants to tell you.
You go to your kitchen, and you want to talk about the fourth thing you want to talk about the fourth of the strange journey for a year, and you've gone to help you remember some friends that help you remember.
So the rigorous speech, their answer -- not word for word for word that is confused by words, but it's just for theme.
The English term "topic sentence," a sentence," a sentence," comes from the Greek word "topos," which means "Stopos," which means "Stopic word "Stopic word "topic word "topic word "topic word "topic word "S
These are translators of what people think about an interesting and raws and raw might be in spaces.
The formulation "an first set of the first place is actually called "An first place in your memory.
I found that all the simple fascinating, and I'm still fascinating.
And to some other poems of the memory of the memory.
I wanted to write a little longer of the competitive remembers of the competitive remembers.
But there was a problem.
The problem is that the memory of the memory of vettle of vettlements are deadly understanding.
It's like a group of people who write and write a test.
It's already exciting someone's going to be sleeping.
I'm journalist, I need something that I needed to write what it is love.
I know that the breathest things happen in the breatest things in the boxes of these people, but I don't have access to it.
So if I wanted to tell this story, I had to try to use my capable.
And so I started to start every morning 15 to 20 minutes before I started to learn something that I'm going to learn something.
Maybe a poem or a poem.
The name from an old year, which I bought on the floor of the floor.
I had to find that it makes a lot of fun,
I could never imagine that.
It's fun, because it's not about it, because it's not about it.
You want to be better and better and better and better and better, these crazy, crazy, funny, and hopefully images, and hopefully inside your eyes.
I was involved me.
Here I'm going to standard memory memory coverage.
A couple of ears, and a protector, and a protection that was covered by two little stripes, because Ables, because Ables's largest enemy of the memory.
I went to the same weather, I had a year earlier I had a year earlier.
And I was introduced to be participate, just as a journalistic experiment.
It could be a nice epilog for my mind.
The problem was that the experiment doesn't like flying.
I won the competition of what's going to happen.
It was nice to be able to reduce a presence and phone numbers and phone numbers and the banks.
These are just tricks.
Tricks the way they work on some simple ideas about some simple ideas about the faction of our brain.
You don't have to build memory, or you're building or you can build a presence of the instruction of your memory, your memory.
We often talking about people with good memory, as if it's a special memory, but that's not true.
Good memory is antrained.
We're going to make things better when we're going to adaptive.
We remember when we're engaged.
We remember the possibility of the possibility, why information and experiences, and experience, and they're using meaning and find out how to do it in turning them into something that we can use them into something that we can do in terms of our memory. If we can sense. Iful. Iful
The poems memory palace, these memory technology, they're all just a currently drawings.
In fact, it's not even the real actual drawings.
They work because they work because they work for us to work.
They're working on us, and they're working in a way that we're not in a way that we're not normally.
But they're not a recent cutting.
So things are going to be things in the memory.
One thing I want to give you a little bit of what I want to give you a little bit of E.P. People who didn't even learning about his memory problems. Our lives are the sum of our memory.
How much are we going to be ready to lose our own lives, and we're going to look at our blackberry or our iPhone or our iPhone, or our iPhone, instead of us, instead of us? How much are we're ready to lose, because we're ready because we're ready because we're ready
I learned that the memory, incredible capacity, incredible capacity.
If we want to live a memory, we need to be a person who don't have to remember the person who don't have to remember.
Thank you.
In the age of 27, I left age of 27, I was increasing job in the business of age: support.
In public schools in New York, I was maths for you.
As any teacher led to teachers and pressures.
I gave homework.
When the works back to work back, I returned Note.
And the only thing was the only difference between the only difference between the best students.
The I<unk>'m a lesson of my strate stratosphic.
Some of my best children don't work very well.
That's what I found myself.
What you learned in Mathhe learning is difficult: Rational numbers, relationsal numbers, decimal numbers of a parallelogram.
But unmannot be possible. I was convinced that all my students could learn to learn the students, and they're working and hard enough to work.
After a few years in school, I came to school, I got a lot better understanding a much better understanding a much better understanding of students and learning from a perspective of motivations.
What we can measure in education is the best measure of I<unk>. But what if you're lives in school and lives from much more fast and learning and easily and easy to learn?
So I left the classroom and made a task for a psychologist.
I started to children and adults in all sorts of original ultra-shaped situation. I was asking me, and why?
My researchestration, and I went to West Point Military.
We tried to stopped to stay at the city of the city of the troops, and what wouldn't.
We went to national bookstability, and we tried to get to the national books, and we were going to go on.
We studied boys who were working in very difficult we worked in very difficult we asked, and asked what teachers would be still be there, and what teachers would be undergressed and what they would be better at learning to the learning.
We closed partnerships with private companies and asked their works, and asking their workforce.
and who would be the money would be earned.
In all these different contex of these different contex of these different idea of economically,
We didn't social intelligence.
It was not good exactly good exception, and it was not I.<unk>.
It was a brought.
And so, the skill is passion and expression and expression and expression.
And so the skills is skilled.
And so the possible, if you're going to be a future plan to a week, not only for a week, but for years, and really hard for years, and really hard to translate this plan to make this plan to use this plan.
And so the way, life is life like a marathon, not sprint.
A few time, I started to study in Chicago Dresponderful schools.
I asked thousands of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the broughts, and then waiting for a year to see who made the degree to see who made the degree.
It turns out that kids with higher-containable probably probably the degree of the degree, even if I'm surely measures, even if I'm going to be able to do things like family, even when they were in the standard tests, even as they were in the sure of the standards.
So the books are counts of counts, not only in Westpoint and in Westpoint and in school, but also in school, especially for children with debreaking with debreed.
The most excuse issue for me is that we know that we know that the science is so little bit about how to build it on how to build it up.
Each day, every day, "How do we support the teacher: "How do we support the brought to children?"
How do I teach kids a children?
How do I think they're motivated them for distance?"
The real answer is, I don't know.
But what I knows is that you can't talent of all, there's no distriction.
Our data shows that many talented people to stay attack people, people don't do it.
In fact, the brutes after our insights, not talent, but correlated, but correlated with talent.
And so for the best idea that I've heard the best idea of distriction of distriction is the so-called conservation.
This idea was developed at Stanford University of Carol Dweck and to learn how to convinced that the ability to learn to learn to learn to change your inside.
Dr. Dock has shown that kids when they learn about the brain, and learning how it changes as answer to change the challenges, and growing very much more likely to believe that true is not a permanent.
This growth of growth of holding, a great idea for the idea of distriction.
But we need more.
So here's what I want to do is, we're pretty much.
That's the work that we're working on us.
We have to strengthen our best intuitions and strongest intuitions.
We need to measure whether we have to be ready to have to be ready to have to learn how to learn how to start learn from learning and start to start lessons.
In other words, we need to be able to give our kids to give our kids to give our kids.
Thank you very much.
In the center of my work is the connection of survival, and part of our community and part of the environments and part of the environments, local conditions.
So I've been as an example of this, ... Two actual projects with this.
Both projects are in Ethiopia, one in Ethiopia and one in Tunisia.
They also have a common is that the different analysis, different analysis, different perspective part of the final architecture of the final architecture.
The first example, the first example, a more stuff, a morestonishing center in Ethiopia, Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Abeba.
This is the way of buildings that we should be designed by building, and I should designed to what we should be designed.
First of all, I thought I wanted to walk.
After we saw some of these buildings -- there are many of these buildings -- there's a lot of them in the city -- we realized that they have three water.
One of the buildings are almost empty because they can't afford to buy things that people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, they need energy, because the surfaces are made of glass, which is what tools inside the inner, and then you need a lot of cool.
In a city where this is not going to happen, because they've been pretty milding weather, which is pretty milding 20 to 25 degrees.
And thirdly, she didn't do anythiopia and Ethiopia.
This is a place with a place with a place with a place and tradition.
And I was also after I was at our first ethiopia book of the old market with this fascinated market, where thousands of people who goes from people, where thousands of people, and a day.
It also has this idea of public space that's using the outside of the outside of creating activity.
So I thought that's exactly what I really want to design a Shopping Mall.
But the question was, how we could make a more stuff, tendency buildings with these principles.
The next challenge came out when we went to look at the basically, because it's in a real growth, because it's in a real growth of the city that you see on the screen, but it's not there.
And it's a lot of two parallels that have been over hundreds of meters have no connection.
So first of all, we went together a connection between these two streets, and we put all the streets of buildings.
This is in a general attrium, which is a free running a free-reportional buildings that are making itself through his own forms and rainforests.
And took this high-time, we put the idea of a market with small colds that are change in every etconomy, because of the high-being.
I also thought, how do we finally finally?
I really wanted to find a solution that reacts on the local climate conditions.
I started thinking about textiles, like a switch of bed with a switch of perforations, and the light, but in drops, and the light, but in distribute.
And then I started to inspired me to the clothes of the clothes of the clothes.
They have the properties of a wonderful geometry, and that's hold fatal went throughout the entire fascinated facilities.
We build this little bit of these little bits, we built the windows, the air, the air, and light on controls and light.
And that's going to be able to use the lights that lights out of the buildings that light out of the buildings to experience the buildings.
It wasn't just starting to convince the buildings with these ideas, because they thought, "Thopping Mall. This is not a scene.
But then we all realized that this idea of the market is much profitable than the idea of a market, because they can sell the idea of a center, because they can sell more color.
And so the concept of the concept of the fact that was much, not only because of the materials, but because we needed to be a climate, but because we didn't need climate.
So we went through some cost of costs that we use to realize the project to realize the project.
The first energy was to think about how we could do the buildings, how we could make the buildings, in a city that could be almost days, in a city that has almost days.
We're going to build a valuable page, by looking at solar panel on the roof.
And we put this panels, we put the roof as new public space with trees and bars and bars and Bars and Bars and Bars.
These vordinary on the roof of the water to the water, and then the water.
Hopefully at the beginning of the next year, because we've been ready to five.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 corrections and in Tunis.
And to do a big project that I had ever designed the biggest project I ever developed the city, I had to understand the city, but also the city, but also the city, the tradition, the tradition and the culture.
While this analysis, I was particularly on the medina, which is the 1,000 years old structure that was connected by 12 tork, and through 12 torks, and through almost just lines.
When I went to the first step, the first step, the first step, the best streets to create the first 12 blocks to create the first 12 blocks and properties like the barcelona and in other european cities with these cities.
In addition, we chose some strategic points in a narrowing in the concept of this torrating lines, and they broadly, and that changed the original patterns.
The last step was to think about the cell, the cell, the little cell, the little cell, like the project, as a small cell, as a small part of the machiner plan.
What would the best equipment in a mediterrane for a mediterrane?
This is North South, in temperature of temperature between the two houseites that are created and a natural districtionate drops.
So we're going to make a pattern that most of the most values that most of the robots are perfectly in these direction.
And that's the result of a combination of a combination of an European blocks and the Arabic city.
There's the blocks with heights and in the Earth, there's all these connections for footprints.
It also filled the local progress of the higher drawing a higher districts and a lowerful distributed distributed.
It also understands the concept of Tore.
The people who were increased forms that are connecting together, and they were made by three different ways, and they also leave a lot of fourth, and in very distribution in the minds. Internet. Internet. Internet. Internet.
The roof, my favorite, the project, the community of the community, the space that's going to be involved by the building.
There are all neighbors and make things like a two-kmaking things like a 2-km-kmorrowing a building.
These two examples have a common another examples of approach to the development process.
They're in swaves, in which you can see the cities that you can see the cities.
In these cities, the effects of architecture in the architecture of people who are local communities and economic community systems, and economic systems.
And so, I think it's important that architecture is simple, but paids, the relationship between the relationship between the environment and the environment, and the environment.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about trusting to talk about trusting to remember the large minds about trust.
They're all the time, they're all becoming clical.
And there's my view of my view.
First of all, a tremendous: trust is strong in the background, believe a lot.
Then a goal: We should trust.
And one is a task: We should be able to build the trust.
I think the targets that the target, and the target, and the targets.
I want to tell you a different story about a target, a goal and a target, and a lot better a much better a much better a lot better a lot better a lot better a lot better.
It's the terms of people think that trusted people are going back to the trust?
And if I really think about my current knowledge about it.
Maybe it's been able to get into some activities or institutions or in other ways.
I'm missing the translator.
But I can look at the survey to look at the source of the source of the source of belief that the belief that the belief that the trust.
Look at the mind of myself asking for a time, not a lot of evidence of evidence.
And socials are going to be the people who were misstracts, mainly journalists and politicians, still miserable.
And the people who were very cructed in 20 years ago, it's still very disease: Richtern, disease.
We're going to be the otherwise, the way, the average citizens are almost exactly in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the mid
But is a good movement?
My possibility -- clearly -- clearly --
What could they do?
So they look at the general approaches of people, if they're going to be asked questions.
Do you trust you? Do you trust teachers?
If you asked someone, if you ask your mission?
Do you trust fish fishers?
Do you trust to graduate?
And then you'd like, "Inwhat are you going to be exactly?"
And that would be a future response.
And if you understand the answer, you might say, "I'm going to say, "I don't trust them."
Alliguous rational.
And so, we're trying to teach our short life, trust to teach other.
We don't go out of it, we don't get any representing every single or institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional institutional
So I could say that I could say that I could tell you that I could get a particular reading to teacher, the first classroom, the first class, but I wouldn't let them go to schoolbus, I wouldn't let the schoolbus.
Maybe I know, I know, I don't know that they're not good car.
I trust that my belief that my black friends were a conversation of friends, but maybe not true to the walk to the secrets.
Simple.
So we know from our all-day, how different trust, how different trust, but how do we look like this knowledge, if we look like this knowledge?
The environments are very bad extraordinary trusted about the fact that they ignore the healthy people that you ignore the healthy people that you're going to be used to contract.
Second, we get to goal.
The goal is to trust more to trust more.
And in fact, I think, I think that's the goal.
I wouldn't go out.
I would try to try to trust the trustworthy more to trust the trust, but not.
I even remotely actively, trust, trust, trust.
And those who are the people who were instance. Parnisse in the hands of a certain metrogen, who made upon the name of the name of the name of the name of the street, "Here's what I think," I think," I think, "I think I'm thinking,"
"More trust is not a smart goal.
Dust trust to use a smart, and to be smart.
And then you say, yes, okay, okay, so the most important, but the most important, but the most important.
The trustworth of people can be appreciate of people.
And to do that, we have to look at three things.
Are they competent? Are they actually lose? Are they lose?
If we have a person in the decide of the common subject, and we find a good reason, then we have a good reason to trust a good reason to trust.
But Is the personal, but unexpected, probably not.
Some of my friends are competent, and I wouldn't let them go out, but they're not a letters, because they're a lot of them.
I have friends who are very in their own competency competition, but they trust to confirmating them.
And I'm very happy to be very happy to be a lot of friends who are completely, but until they're incredibly.
If you're not realized it.
But then we look forward, we're looking for trustworthy, then trust.
Dust trust is the response.
The trustworth, we have to be appreciate. That's hard to be hard.
Over the last decades, we tried to try to do control systems with all sorts of institutions and easiers and easier to make their trust, their trusts that we're going to make their trust.
Many of these systems have the opposite effect.
They don't work how much works.
One home told me, "That problem is that the paper is that the paper crap out of the world."
Everywhere in our public dependent in our institutions, and this problem. This is the control system, and the control system, and the belief, but forthy, but forth.
It's people like Hebs from their difficult tasks by their difficult tasks by tasks.
And here's the sure of each examples.
So much for the goal.
The goal is more trusted, and that's going to be difficult, and that's going to be trusted, and if we want to communicate and if we want to be appreciate whether other people, or politicians, or politicians, or politician, or politicious.
It's not easy. You have to do it. Simple response or holds or holds.
And now the task.
This is as a result of the trustwers of the trust, the thing that's the thing.
Because it's definitely to build trust.
We can do that, of course, we can do it.
We can win a little bit of trustworthy.
So there are two people in their trust in one another.
But finally, the trust is trusted by characterized that it's going to be one of the other people.
You can't build that back to the other one.
You have to give them a basis of them.
So you have to be trusted.
And of course, that you can't take all the people who can't all people to do the nose of the nose.
But you also have to do evidence that you're trusting to be trusted.
How does that?
That's all happening every day, every day. Normal people do it, effective.
Here's a simple example of example.
The laden I buy my small smallpower me back to me, and they don't ask me to ask them.
They take them back and give me the money back, or a few of the sockets in the color.
That's great. I'm trusted them, because they've shown me.
There's a really important moral.
And you can see the opposite of the opposite, it's a very good handful, and you're a very good evidence, and that you're going to believe that you're belief.
So our goal is not very difficult to see very difficult to see very difficult.
It's relationships between people, and the intriguous people, and whether the other people, and whether the other.
So the moral of the story is much less about trusting, much less about trusting to think about a matter of minds, or increasingly, or incorrection or incorrectly, and how to use, and how to useful and how to use people, and how to use people useful and how to useful and how to
Thank you.
You know, the best thing about the father's films that I can look at the films I can look at the films.
I love it, my own love favorite films with my children, when my daughters, when my daughters, we've looked at "The At Magic.
The movie has not left it to months.
Your love was natural guy was natural glinda.
So she had a good excuse, a glitzering clothes and a magic, and a magic.
But if you look at this movie, you know, you're extraordinary, you know, it's actually extraordinary.
We live in the world today, and we're going to be in a way of spectacular children in a way of great.
But "The America was different.
He didn't start to do this trend.
It's 40 years, until this trends up to this trends with -- an interestingly, with -- another film that a guy from Metall and a guy with a girl, and a girls by a girls of the enemype of the enemy.
You know where I talk about, right?
That's exactly what we're doing.
Well, there's a big difference between these two films, even more big differences between "The America," and all the films that we looked at the films that we're going to look like this.
First of all, there's a lot of Oz," very little violence.
The monkey is pretty aggressive, as the apple.
But I think if "The Ampote from Oz," today," would have been produced, the magic, you'd say, "Torothy, you're going to be a prophected by Oz,
Bened your magical schools to create the computers to create the bad arms of the West hexected arms of the West."
But that's not what happens.
Another point I think, "The Magic of Oz," very unique," is that the most common, and even clearly never matters and even never might be female.
And I realized the first time I was the first time I showed my daughter "Star Wars," and the situation was different.
At the time, I had a son, I had a son.
He was at the time, he was three years old.
He wasn't invited to young, and he wasn't going to be young.
But he was the second child, and he was less than his sister than his sister.
So he's kind of, and he's got to be introduced, and he's a grandmother, and I don't think he was a presented, and I don't think he was sure that he was surely safe.
And I asked myself, what he's going on there.
Hat he stopped that it's about mut, tarriers and Loyality and Loyality?
Hat he stopped that luke a poor to stop a poor to stop the government?
Happed to be done by the universe, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of cool, but of cool, but as the most cool, but while most of the time, but while they were really cooling the heroes and a media, and a media, and a media,
Compare that with "The America of Oz" from 1939.
How does the village of her film to a good end of good end?
By the way, with all of them, and a leader and a leader.
That's the way I would love my kids, or what would be big, right? -- Oz, right? -- and not in the world, or not in the world today, which is pretty much ourselves today.
Why is so much power -- big power -- big power -- in the movies that we have been doing so few yellow?

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about the story of a clinstad city.
I don't know his name, but his name, but his story.
He lives in a small village in a small village.
His village is in the nearby of Mogadian.
The door is causing the poverty of this village and the village of the village.
When it wasn't there, which he thought its village, he went town village, in this case, Mogadias, Mogadias.
When he comes out there, there's no way to do not work, no work, no evidence.
And it's the end of the tenth of Mogadian outside of Mogadian.
It maybe a year, but nothing.
One day, he's going to be a man who's been a man who's afternoon, then the night, then the early, then after the fruit.
He makes these dynamic group of young people, and they give him a chance.
He gets a little bit money to buy new clothes and buying money to send money to send money.
Their is going to be this young woman.
Finally, hearing.
He starts a new life.
His life has a sense.
On a beautiful day in Mogadiu, under Azurblue, a car, a car.
This grandchildren with grandchildren with grandmashed, and bombs and bombs and bombs and bombs and bombs, an older people were older people, an old-Shabaaaaaa.
How could the story of a clinstad city, just trying to construction, just trying to confused to use itself in the air, that he was able to line?
He had gone.
He had been waiting for a opportunity to the future, and it was the first opportunity that was the first opportunity that was the first opportunity.
It was the first thing that we called him out of a state that we call "Waithood" that we call "Waithood."
And his story repeated again, over again, over again, and over the world.
It's the story of the story of the story of the bana, the Johannesburg and London, and London, and London, and London, and after something else than "Waithood."
Boy people are promise by the city, from their grandstruments, possibilities, well, well, well, well, well, but young people don't have a charity.
Of course, it's the jeweless of high-down.
In 2030, three of five in 2030s, in the cities in the cities.
If we don't have young people in the growth of the cities when we're not going to be able to do this, "Waithood"," which is the one that's going to terrorism, in the violence and in Gangs.
In my birth, Mogadian, Mogadian, mogadic, 70 percent of young people under working with working.
70 percent don't go to school.
They don't do anything.
Last month, I'm after Mogadina, and I went to Madina Cranks to Madina Cranks, where I was born.
I remember how I remember this carship, and I asked me what if I never thought I'd never been here?
What if I was to the same state of the same state of "Waithood"?
Would I have become terrorist?
I'm not sure what I should say.
The reason for my job for my called this month, this month, the excitement of a guy in the months of leaderships and entrepreneurs.
I brought about 90 young went throughout leaderships.
We sat down together and made a brinstorming for the largest challenges of their city.
In space, a young man, a young man,
He went took the university in Mogadian and made his degree.
There was no work and no ways.
I remember how he said he to me, he said he had a university, working with a university, and frustrated goal, and frustrated goal of old goal with old terrorganizations.
They were looking for him.
But this story is a different running.
In Mogadicu are the largest hands to come from A to Behinds.
Twenty-old war, the streets of the streets, so that's the best citizens of the best citizens.
All the opportunity and he realized them.
He opened a motorcycle.
He started to place motorcycles in place to might not be afford to be easy to be easy too.
With help his family and friends and friends, and he bought it's going to be able to trees your business, and he was going to go to some hundreds of three years.
How do we do this story of the other?
What makes the difference?
I think it's his ability to see a new opportunity to recognize a new opportunity.
It's the entrepreneurs, and I believe that entrepreneurs we're going to be the most effective middle.
It's a young people to create economic chances that they're looking for them.
You can teach young people to be teachers, companies.
I want to talk to young man who talked to young man who was participate with a young manufacturing, Mohamoud, a rorist.
He helped me to show the entrepreneurs who were participants that are participate and show them how to show them how to show them how to do innovative and entrepreneurs.
He's actually the first florist, the first florist, the Mogadian, and until 22 years ago, and before Mohameded, you use came from the artificial came from the scale, if you wanted to be able to be able to be able to be able to be on his head.
If you ask someone said, "When you saw this last time, you saw the last time you saw the answer of many, who was the answer of many, who was growing up in the citizens, "No one."
So Mohamededed a opportunity.
He founded a landscape with flowership with flowers.
He put a plantage outside Mogadian Mogadian, and started to tulps and liles and liles, and Lilies, like he said, where he said, where he said,
He started to popularly with flowers, he started to popular public private gardens and businesses around the city of the first public public public parks in Mogaduadian parks in Mogaduaduadium.
There's no public parks in Mogadian.
He wants to create a place where families and young people come together and how he says, how to beautiful things.
Just as the Rande: He doesn't need to have a rose because they need to have a lot of water.
So the first step is, young people inspire young people, and in this room had a molds of applications on the other young people in the space.
They never really thought about it, a company to green.
They thought about it, for a NGO to work or for the government, but this story, this story, his innovation, a strong influence.
He was certainly asked her city as a place of opportunities.
He was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to bring the change.
At the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges of their city.
They had the entrepreneurial solutions for local problems.
The inspiration young people and the creating a company is a really big step, but young people need capital to use capital to use capital to use their ideas.
They need things to do things and support standing and support them to develop their businesses and start to start to start to start.
Bring young people with the resources that they need to be able to use them, you need to give them the underestimate them to connect the ideas that they need catalys to confusing ideas for urban growth, catalys.
For me, for me, the company is more than just the reasons.
It's about the creation of social effects.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I believe he selling hope.
His such a field field, when he's created, the point of views of humans on their city.
At the streets are involved to help him to help him to stop the motorcy and instanding instanding.
He gave them the chance that we got to get the chance of "Waithood"
These young businesses have a huge impact on their cities.
So my proposal is, young people to leave young people, and young people, and you're going to leave their own innovations about flowers and you're going to get more stories about automous parks and "Withood."
Thank you very much.
As my childhood in Maine was one of my favorite businesses, after Sanddollars, because my parents, because my parents, because my parents, because my parents.
But these muscles are hard to find.
They're from Sand to see sand around the sand.
But after a certain time, I had a routine.
I started looking at forms, and I'm going to gather them.
And that developed to find things to find things to find things to find things to find things to a love for past and the archaeology.
And when I started studyptology, Egyptology, I realized that the looked at my blocks with my block eyes.
Because suddenly wake up in Egyptian street in Maine, my little street in Maine, and my sanddollars, and my sanddollars. And my sanddollars.
And that led me to use satellites me to use satellites.
I had to see the past to see the past to see the past.
I want to show you how we're going to show you how we use infrarating infrarating infrarating infrarating infrarators.
This is a state that's an eastern Egyptian Delta called Mendes Mendes Mendes.
And the piece of the visible. We use it. We use infrar, and infrar, and infrar color, it's going to be able to do this store.
What you see here, the chemical chemical chemical chemical change, and -- and --activities and --
What I want to share with you today is used today, like we have satellite a older city of an older city, the name Itj-taught the name Itj-taughts of years.
Itj-taui was the mainstad of the altogype of the altual, more than four hundred years ago, in an epoche, about fourths ago.
The piece is in Egyptian al-Fayyum, and it's very significant, because it's a big rich rich renaissance for older architecture and religion.
Egyptologists knew that the stocks of Itj-tauired of Itj-tauike the pyramid of the pyramid, he built by the two kings, but somewhere in this massive silence in this massive swample of massive switches.
This area is big -- the surface -- the floates four times.
From the early on Itj-tausted at Itj-taui, and as its running in the west, and he was looking at the city, he was city.
So how you find a city of a city in one of the city in one of the city.
They're going to find the equivalent to find the equivalent to find the needle in the headel in the headels and baseball-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-h
And so we used NASAs Typography of the landscape of the landscape to see a map of easy change.
Where the running of the Nils.
But you can see exactly the exactly interesting, and that's very interesting approaches us as a position for circle that us as a position for the city of City.
So we worked with Egyptian scientists together together to create high cored cored.
This is like Hocrus cored instead of stories, just instead of the climate change, you're looking for the human beings, you're looking for human beings.
In a deep of five meters, under a thick slamm, we found a drawing, we found a distinction of tone.
And that shows that position for Itj-taui, in five meters in five meters, we can find a hundred years, we can find a hundred years to find a hundred years to go back to the exact side of the exacts that we're going to be able to exactly the existence of It.
We found outside the work of a col, <unk>uart -- Karneol, and achat -- which shows you that here's a juweler.
This may not looking for a lot of, but if you look at the most possible set of Juwels in the Middle Europe, you find exactly these stone, you find exactly these stone.
So we found a story of the story of the state of this state of the state of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the story.
We also found evidence for a Juwelier for the foreign society, which is a very important city.
It wasn't there was no way to show you that still return to this piece of these voice to show a map.
What's more important, we're going to be egyptians who are in the satellite technology, so they're going to be able to do the same thing to do with that.
So I wanted to wanted to close my favorite quote from the Middle English, maybe in the city of Itj-tauired years ago.
"You know, the biggest of all the biggest of all reports.
There's nothing the same in the country."
TED, not in 1984. Chr. Chr.
But in fact, but actually, in 1984, in 1984. Chr. Chr. Chr. Chr.
You can see that with the muscle of the streets are same.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I grew up in Taiwan as a daughter of a case of my beauty, my beauty, like my mother, like my mother, the beauty, and the shape of Chinese writers.
Seither I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a moment, it seems like this, it seems like the grandmaster of China.
In the last few years, I wondered how I can do this master to do this master to understand this complex language, and I've learned to understand that.
I thought that a new fast method, Chinese fast method, and I would be useful.
I've learned about five. I learned every single strips in the right drawings in the right drawing.
In the next 15 years, I learned every day, I learned every day.
And we're just five minutes, it would be a faster and simple more faster and simple ways.
A Chinese type of chinese type of 20,000 writers.
They just need 1,000 writers for a simple writing simple writing.
The most important thing that you can do, 40 percent of the simple literature -- enough to streets, specifically, specifically, and the basically, or time.
Today, I start to show you eight sign up to show you how the methods works.
Are you ready?
"You're open mouths, as possible to square.
That's a mouth.
This person is going to space.
"Man".
If the original for "Feuer" a human beings with high-powered arms," "Hey!"
This is a tree.
"Baum."
This is a "Berg"
The Sun.
The Mola.
The type of "Turtle" looks like a saloont of the west.
These eight signs are radical.
They're the reason to build a diversity of writing a variety of writers.
A human.
If someone who's still going to be a person, it means "fold."
As it more, then, then two "Begleitation," and three of a "Manegledge."
If a human beings, then this person says, "It's even saying, "It's even great."
The human in the mouth, it's like in the mouth.
It's a "Gefinger," like Jonas in the forest.
A tree tree tree tree tree trees. Two trees for a trees.
Three together for a "Wald"
Sit down a planke under the tree, and you have a "Basis."
Sit down a mouth, you're going to call it "idiotic."
Justice, because a speaker, because a speaker boom,
Do you remember the fire?
Two flowers are coming out of two flavor."
Three fire fire, many "Flame."
Sit down the fire of two trees, it means "burning it means "burning."
For us, the sun, the source of the real source.
Two sunships together "though."
Three is "Funks."
If the sun, the sun, and the moon, it means "Hellness."
In the cooperation can also be used for the next day.
The sun is about the horizont on the horizont of the sun.
Turt. A bread is in the door.
Place you're going to put a mouth, it means "Well,"
Clopf, clopf. Is there?
These person bads out of door. "flowers," "thouse."
The left is the "Frau".
Two women are standing for a "Streit."
On the marriage of three women: "Ehebridge."
We now have 30 writers are now 30 writers.
With this method, you can build out of the first eight radical three words.
The next group of eight signs with eight signs together.
With a little bit of a little bit of a few hundreds of hundreds of magnitude a night-old child.
If we can start to put these types, we start together.
For example, and firefilled and firefilling the firefilling a "Vulkan."
We know, Japan is the country of sun.
This is the sun, the sun, because Japan, because Japan, because Japan.
A sun, a sun, a sun, "Japan."
A human behind Japan?
As a "Japanese."
The writers are two mountains are two mountains of each other.
In classical Chinese chinese means "Exil" because Chinese caiser their political enemy to be political enemy in exilities.
Today, "Exil" today."
A mouth, who says where it's going to be out of "Ausgang."
That's the slide that remind me of the stage, the stage.
