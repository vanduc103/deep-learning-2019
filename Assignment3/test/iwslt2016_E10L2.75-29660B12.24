When I was in my 20s, I had my first psychotherapy psychotherapy patient.
I was Doctorandin and studied clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman called Alex.
When Alex in the first sitation came to Jeans and approached Jeans and you followed it on the sofa in my office, and she was telling her sandales of their sandales of men and tell me about men problems.
And when I heard that I was similar.
My community, I got a bright brought a bridge as the first patients.
And I got a woman in the 20s, who wanted to talk about boys.
I wrote that I thought I thought.
But I didn't have a highly.
With the loss of stories that had to take the situation, it was easy for me to take the head for me to nick the problems, while we're going to move the problems.
"30 is the new 20," said Alex and I could have a bit of my time, she had a bit.
worked later, he got later, he got later, children later, even the death, even the death.
People like Alex and I didn't have anything.
But as soon asked me my bedroom, Alex's Liebes,
I'm holding it.
I said, "Yes, she's clear, she's sleeping their nive, they're going to be sleeping it, but it's not going to be him.
And there said, "Well, I don't married, but maybe they're the next.
And then the best time, the best time, the best time, the best time they're married."
That's what psychologists call a Aha-Moment.
That was the moment that wasn't aware that 30, not the new 20.
Yes, people are later, people later, but it's never been after, but that made Alex's 20s, 20ers don't have to development.
That made Alex's 20s to the optimal development and we sat down there and we sat down there and we sat down.
And so I realized that these kinds of hard-less various variety of harmless problem with real consequences. Nich only for Alex and their love, but for Alex and their love, but for the careers, families and exists in 20s.
And then, there's a million people in the United States 50 million people in the 20s.
We talk about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent of the population, if you think that no one of the adults, no one of the 20s.
Meldet you're going to be in your engine.
I want to see a few of you.
Oh, yeah! You're all unbelievable.
If you're working with someone in the 20s, a love, because of a hurt in the 20s, I want to see you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Great.
My specials that are people in the 20s, because I think that everyone is that every single one of these 50 million knows that we should know what psychologists, neurologists, neurologists, and the fear of the most simplests.
This is not my opinion. That's Facts.
We know that 80 percent of the present moments, in time to 350 percent of the time.
That means that 8 of 10 decisions, experiences, experiences and Aha-Erlebn knowledge that are going to do, which is what it's happened to her middle.
Will not panish if you're not panished about 40.
This group is going to be good, I think it's good.
We know that the first 10 years of a mountain of a recording exponential effects, how much money you're going to be money.
We know that with 30 more than the half of Americans, or the Americans or together or together or a relationship or a relationship.
We know that the brain is the second and last growing in the 20s, and last growing up in the 20s, and for the adults, which means that whatever you want to change their own, which means that whatever it would be.
We know that the personality is changed as the 20s, as anything else than anything in life and that the fear of women with 28 their heights with 28 their heights and that the women are complicated.
So in the 20s, you should continue to the body and the own own own own own own own opportunities.
If we think about the development of a child, we all know that the first 5 years for language and binds in the brain and binding in the brain.
It's time, in the massive, all of the world has a surrounded life on the future.
But we hear about it, we hear about it, there's something like adults, and our 20s, and our 20s, and our 20s approached time for it.
But that's not going to hear the 20s.
The press is reded over time, the time of the adults of the adults.
Scientists called 20s, the 20er center of pubert.
Journalists think about why spitznames for people in the 20s, like "Twixters" or "Twixters" or "Cind-by-based."
That's true.
When culture we have the trivialized what now is now the decade for the adults.
Leonard Bernstein was that great things with a plan and something to a plan and something to be a little time.
Doesn't it?
So what happens when you're going to tell someone in the 20s, and says, "You get 10 years to make something out of your life?
Garn't anything.
This human is the person is the atmbition and the disease. And it's nothing.
And so every day intelligence intelligence, people in the 20s, like your sons and taughters and taughter and taughter and say, "I know something like, I don't know, but I don't know, I don't know, but I don't know that't block the time."
Or they say, "All, so long as I did it with 30 years, I've been able to start my career, everything."
But later, it's like, "My 20er are almost 20s, and I don't have anything.
I had a better life when I was just sitting the university."
And then it turns out, "In my 20s, my 20s was Partners, I was after Jerusalem.
Everyone love and fun, but then the music, and then the music, and then everyone went to the music.
I didn't want to be the only one that I think I've got my husband, I think I've got my husband, because he was in my 30s of the next staff."
Where are the people in the 20s?
Don't do that.
OK, that's a light, but doesn't make a mistake, because it's about a lot.
If you've been talking about 30s, there's a huge pressure, there's a career, a career, a city to start a city, a partner and two or three kids and two kids and two children in a lot of city.
Many of these things are incompatible and how researchers are just showing you just show up to a mouth and stress as all of these 30s.
The post-millions of Midlife Midlife crisisism, not to buy a red sportwagen.
It means that you want to do the career that you can do not do.
To memories don't have this children, or the kids you can't give you a student.
For many people in the 30s and 40s, and 40s, and say, "What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? What did I do?
I want to change what people do in the 20s and think about 20s and think about the 20s.
This is a story that shows how it can be selling how it can be.
It's the story of Ema.
Ema came in my office when she was 25, because she had 25, because she had a identity.
She said they would like to work in the middle artists or in the entertainment, but she didn't have decided to behavior, and so they would have done in the past few years.
Because the billiger was, she lived with her friends who were more of his temperament as his temperament as his embition.
And even though their 20s were hard, their years of them were still a lot of bad.
She often in the situations, but then she collects, and she said, "The Family can't look out of your friends, but your friends.
One day, a day, Emazing emails, and I finally finally the whole stounds all the stound.
She had a drawing bought and they spent the whole morning all the morning, and then they were a single contact on the words, but then they were strong the words that were broke up.
She was almost hysteric, when she looked at me and said, "Who's going to be a car, if I have a car.
Who will I try to make cancer?"
In the moment I had together together to say, "I'm not to say, "I"
But Ema needed no therapists who really care about them, really, really, really, really, really, really,
Ema needed a better life, and I knew that was their chance.
I had been since my first patient Alexlex Alexlex to look at how emasily to look like Emastern decade, like Emastern decade.
In the next weeks and months, I gave Ema three rather than any 20-year-old, whether Mann or woman or woman or woman,
First, I told Ema, I wouldn't have identity, they didn't have an identity crisisis, they're a lot of identity capital.
And so I thought they would look at something that they would look forward.
Power something that's a investment, investment is investment in something that you want to be.
I didn't know about emasy for emasily and no white, and no white the future of work, but I know, I know, I know, I know, Identity capital.
So now the time for this international job, this practicum, this practices that trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do that.
I don't give you the discovery of the 20s, but the 20er, the non-free that are not a discovery.
This is procastination.
I said to Ema: He's the works, but what you do.
Secondly, I said, the original Sippeared.
Good friends are primate to get to the airplane to get 20s, but 20s who are highly highly highly, like they know how they're care about what they know, they know what they're working, how they're working and where they're working.
This new person to be able to reach these new person to the process of the most extraordinary environment.
New things like this. "That's looking at the end of friends," from friends of friends.
It's true: The half of 20er is undergrad or not decided or not critical.
But the other hands is not and black boxes, they have a book.
The half of Jobs are never been able to do the same. So if you could neighborhood, and so it's not approached job.
This is not a bedrug. So it's not a bedroad.
The last Rat: Ema believed that you couldn't look at the family, but the friends.
This is true for her when they looked at it, but as 20er, they would be bald her own family, when they look at a partner of their own family, and a partner family basically.
I said, "I'm going to look at new family, which would be now.
You might think that it's better than 30 better, it's never been better than 20 or 25, and I'm going to stimulate it.
But anyone who you are sleeping or lives, or lives, in your life, if everyone on Facebook, if everyone on Facebook, it's not a progress.
The best time to plane to plan, is before her a handful, and that means a hand, and that means to be able to be able to be as in your work.
Eur family, either, means that means and the extraordinary, and not because it doesn't want to work, or with anyone who has been working on the time, or someone who has been looking at the time.
So what happened with Ema?
We went to her adress book, and they found the middle of a cousin, who worked in a different basically in a museum.
This is a black band, you know, you're going to get a work.
This works for a long time, her basically, their friends, with her friends with the friends.
Now, five years later, it's event planer, it's event planer.
She's got a man whole thing that they've been choice.
They loved their new career and their new family and their new family and she sands me a map, "You're the question: "You're not big enough."
Emas story clearly, as if it's just like this. But that's what I love in 20-year-old.
It's so simple to help them.
20-year-olds are like strong flights, the rivers that are just leave the airplane, and somewhere elsewhere.
Good after the start can make a little key course, whether you do in Alaska or in Alaska or in Fider.
The same thing for 21-year-old for 21-year-old, a good conversation, a great depression, a great urban TEDTalk can be a tremendous effects, and even over years, and even over years.
This is an idea that all 20s who all 20s who knows that you know.
It's just like what I said to Alex said.
I have the privileg, these 20s like Ema every day with emails: The 30s are not the new 20s, so it's not the new 20s, so it's a identity capital, you're looking for yourself.
Defines don't think about what you don't know what you didn't know.
You're decided to be over your life.
Thank you.
In the entire computer story, it was always our goal, and our goal, and the digital information between our physical world and digital world, and the lies that we can be able to record our physical world and the world where we can remain our image.
And this is smaller, little bit, little and always smaller, and now it's smaller than a billion, and now, the dickeepscrease, and computer are certainly achieve.
But I asked myself, how it would be like it, if it wasn't be a border.
I've been predicting how this looks like this.
First of all, I developed this tools, which is a digital world, and so if you're going to be strong on the screen, it's the physical figure.
Designers can be so directly in 3D materializing and chirtual organizing the screen,
So with this tools, the border was broken by broken.
But our hands are still still outside the screen.
How can we interact with the digital information, and how do we interact with the whole story of our hands?
In Microsoft Applied Sciencesces, I've been collabor Cati Boulanger, the computer, and a little roomputer, and a little room in a digital workplace.
And by that a transparenter screen and tieparent screen and deep fingers, you can be combined by fingers, you can now be high-down, you can be high-down, in the 3D rooms and Pixels with the blocks.
There's a position and date a position in the factory, you can choose them so easily, how to make a book from a book from a regal.
Then you can see through this book and we can markets and words, and the words, and all of this virtual Touchpadday.
Architects can be directly with their models with their hands and redes.
So in these two example, we're doing in the digital world.
But how would it be if we turn the whole thing to do is carefully and the digital information?
Sure have a lot of you have a lot of you to buy a lot of article online, article online.
But now you have to do that, you don't have to do anymore.
Here I have a "Online Augmented Augmented Augmen.
This is what you're doing is you through a head, or by a head or by the mometry, when the system of our body, the system of our body.
This idea of the idea, I started thinking about it, I started thinking about the pixels, but they can't just see physically, but they can feel physically feel them.
How would a such a future?
In MIT Media Lab, I've been collaborator Hirishi Ishiii and my membershi Post, a real pixel.
Now, in this case, in this case, this rounds like a three-dimensional Pixel in our world. That means that significant carbon directly, and that's what people can do this object, and inside this little 3DRumps.
We've been able to transform the hard force and control the movement, by using magnetic levitation, mechanical levitation, mechanical approaching technologies.
Indeed the object digital programming, we're representing it from the space and time, and time, and time, and time, and time, and time, again, and then you can get to the real world.
So, like, Choreographies can be done by choreographics or Michael Jordans, or Michael Jordans and back into the world.
And soon, this can use this complex concepts like planets like planets and physics. And other than computer screen or textbooks or textbooks or textbooks, and they can make a regular experience and feeling very powerful experience and feeling them is very powerfulf
And even more exciting than just what we've moment in the computer, to materializing, it's to make the programming the programming of the world, even our degrams.
How you can't just show you, digital information, but we're just going to show you something, right now, directly with us as part of our physics, without our physics, without our real world.
Today, we've been talking about the limits, but if we're talking about the borders, but if we're going to be the only border.
Thank you.
I was carrying two years to become a turnerina, in Hunan, China, China, China, in the 1970s.
When I was in the first class, I wanted to look at the government for Athletal for Athletle for Athletal.
But my mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to be intergenery like they're going to be.
After they had the culture of culture, they found that the only way they found that the only way to happiness, and well, and well, and well, and well, and well,
It's not important, whether I don't like the job.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opener.
This is what I'm like to talk about my inaginary clavier.
Opers have to start with the Acrobatics, and I have to start with the Acrobatics. So I tried everything to go to the open.
I wrote away from the shockirector and the moderator of a radioshow.
But the adults moched my idea.
The adults don't think that it wasn't seriously.
Just my friends, but they were also a children, but they were just as children, just like I'm just like myself.
And with 15 years, I knew I was to old to old to the training.
So my dream would never be true.
I had anxiety of that I could only get the rest of my life, just a lucky choice.
But that's so unfortunately.
So I had to find my head, another recording to find another record.
No one of them to learn something? All right? All right?
So I went to books.
I stilled my head, and I was after a rather than a book about a book about a book of minds and musician family. I found my family of Fully." I found myself in a unknown woman who could continue to the village.
<unk>"Sanmaosaosa's Laosa's Lesson's Laijin<unk> 1995 came to the United States, and what books I got to first?
Of course, the books that are both.
"The Good Earth's great Earth.
It's not just a propaganda. Have I understood.
The Bible is interesting, but it's interesting.
But that's a subject for another time.
But the five buildings took me a kind of experience: "You should you like your father and your mother."
"Ehre", I thought, "das's so different and much better than brain."
That was my way and way to relate me from the confuzian school and the relationship and the relationship to my parents.
And by the reason I started with a new culture, I started with the compare les.
This is a lot of a lot of a bubble.
I found this map, this maps are not really carefully, because Chinese students with this here.
It was never in the sense that China didn't have to be in the world.
So a map of cards saying something about the personal view.
The same thing is nothing new les is nothing new.
In the academic world is a standard profession.
There's even research research as compared rules like compared science and compared literature.
Compare and opportunity to make a complex change complex change.
So I thought, if I was available les in the research, why not in the deal life?
So I started to read two books.
You can see from people -- <unk>"Benjamin Franklin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson<unk> <unk>"John Adams, which were the same events of David McCully, or from friends.
<unk>"We's done.
Christus were the trials that we were able to economic and spiritual nature.
And when Buddha, they all psychological nature: Lust, fear and social psychological plants -- interesting.
If you have a friend language, it also makes it fun, the love, the loved languages in two languages.
<unk>"Sinfony for a seavogel" by Thomas Merton<unk> <unk>"Der Life of the water -- the life of the Taoism of Alan Watts<unk> Anth Asia, I can found out how I can found out how I can found out how I found out how I can found out.
And by the way, for example, for example, for example, that "Gluck" in Chinese wonderful free," means "gnown Freude."
"Braut" in Chinese means "Braut" means "neue Mother Mother. Ohohoh. Ohohoh.
Books are for me as a magical day. It's a magical tor. I have a connection of people, and violence.
I know that I never felt a little bit more or make it feels.
A quite a dream is nothing in the compare of what many other people have been doing.
I'm approaching to be the surveillance of a tree-dium of a dream.
His important cover is to bring us to the mountains where our lives are coming from where our passion and our passion and our passion and our lucky and our happiness and our happiness.
Even a certain trees can make this suggest.
Because books here, I'm here today, again, again, and with a clear bubble bubble bubble.
More always beautiful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was 8 years old, a new girls in the class, and she was so impressive, and she was so expressed as new girls.
She had long-terma, and a little bit nowles, and a little bit of writing was good in Geography and in the book.
In some schoolject I raste, I had a text to you, until I had a technique.
So I stayed one day, I was a little bit longer in school, and I hold myself in the marchoilets.
When the air, I was came out, I got took me in classroom, and I took me the nodes of the teacher.
And then I did.
If you have the nodes of my rivalin, just a few single one.
All of a series.
When I wanted to go back to me that some of my other classrooms, some of my other classrooms.
So I corrigated in the eified in the eification without fantasy.
I gave all fourer and I gave me another, because I was also the whole time.
I'm still used to behavior.
I don't understand where the thought of the thought.
I don't understand why I felt so good at that.
I felt really good.
I don't understand why I never been never been able to do this.
It was so obvious.
I never became an expect.
But most of the most amazing me, why did it so much that this little girls so good at the books so good at book?
Eified me.
It's so deeply so deeply, so deeply.
We know that babies are under easy to live.
Even as Primates. Hills are made by nature.
We know that effects the main reason for Mord, the Mord.
But I never have a study that could never explain their own skills or their long-cability or their making nerves.
We have to be able to the literature, because the roman is the lab, because the lab, the lab, in all their possible forms.
Is it a surveillance to say that if we didn't have any eified to have no literature?
So no until you don't have "Odyssee."
No more efforts, no night, no "Aven't seven.
No Shakespeare.
There are the lesists of the U.S., because we lose, because we lose, we lose, "Shall and Wahn", "Thall and Wahn," "Fiesta," "Madam Bovary," "Ana Karina.
No practice, no proust. I know that it's not a proust. I know that Proust the answer is that proust the answer, but in puncto Eifer.
This year, we celebrate the 200th of Jubila's "And of the search for the search for the lost time and his green time and his green analysis and the normal analysis and the normal weather, my ding, my dinginging.
So let's think about Proust, we think about emotion?
We think about the little boys who tried to sleep.
We think about a piece of cooking in Lavendel smoking.
We forget how raw his vision was.
We forget how it's expectation is.
These kinds of books are for virginia Woolful, like catzendarm.
I don't know how catzendarm is, but we say, it's a pressure.
Let's look at why the roman and the eifth and the eifth and prousters together and prousts together.
Is it so obvious that effects, reduced on person -- hinders -- hinders -- history, solid a fest reason for a story?
I don't know. I think it's just hard to the pain, because you think about what happens when we think about what happens when we're actually looking at.
If we're really excited, we're telling us a story.
He tell us ourselves, ourselves of the other people and they're bad about life, because they're bad because they're bad.
When he was the story and the audience, we know what the audience, they need to stay to stay the message to stand the message. Ripping the ripps?
Eified all of us all to Amateur Romanautor, and so that can be powerful.
And the first band, "In Swanns," in the Roman Roman Rome, Swann, one of the protagonists, and how it's very suddenly about his money, and how great them in the bed, and suddenly, and so they're a suddenly suddenly suddenly.
Everything they're already, and what I could also read someone else, maybe someone else, maybe even in this moment."
This is the story that he tells us, and from there, and from there, and from there's proust that Swanner, who he's going to be in his game, to his game, to be in the private following in his private following.
We have to say that Swann and Proust Austroust necessary.
Prousts Frousts, the country, if they want to make it with him.
But you don't have to be reflective to a single trees that it's hard work. Right?
It's approaches.
It's a hungry, it's going to be dangerous.
What does the eificial?
Eified magnitude.
Eified magnitor.
It's a magically long harm and small now-low-low-like shirt.
Eified magically photos.
That's why instagram, even successful.
In the reason why the language of science and the eificial and the eificial and the eificials.
If Swanning this eified suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, and the door, and the dyeries of his money, and the services.
He says, "You maybe that's abstracting is nothing but it's nothing different texts, anticians, or a drawing or a drawing."
He says, "It have scientific differences with you intellectual value."
Proust us to show us that easy to show us that easy is impossible, but in their old, but in their core is a search for knowledge, after knowledge, and what painful truth, and what Prouster.
Cummer, the desert, the pattern -- that's for Proust of the way to the wisdom.
He says, "A woman we need to be able to read us a bigger and we're going to be a bigger and bread and breading us as the genius of a man who interested in the genius of a man who interested in."
And he's about it, we should look at us?
No. I think he's trying to tell us that easy to tell us something about us.
Is there another feeling that we opened us to this particular way?
Enthern Enthelize else emotion, our aggression, our early and our answer and our answer?
Let's teaching us to be such a sense of such such a sense of intensity?
Freudying later, and write about it.
One day, Freuded Freuded by a very best young man on the thought of the thought was that his wife.
And Freudes says, this man is kind of a sort of sort of thing because he doesn't even goes up, which doesn't even behind his wife.
Because it's until it's because everyone knows.
The poor creature is basically undergraded.
Instead, he looked for things that he looked at his wife, no, no, so it's notice, so unable behavior.
and they're going too much or still together with a man?
<unk>Freud<unk>" says that the man to the manufacturing of the underware of his wife.
The Roman is very good in this point.
The Roman is very good, very good, as eified us to look at the time, but not just intense, but not just exactly whatever.
Because the real personality we are, the more than fantasies.
So I think that epidemically don't get us to do it, or illegal things.
Eified to be able to be very supportive to be very successful.
And I think about 8 years, I think about 8 years, but I think I've heard the story that I've heard in the news.
A five-year-old woman, because they were false because they were wrong by a self-old false Facebook Acountry, a year, a year-count of news, written on themselves.
A whole year.
She tried to write the new friend of their ex-free friends in school, and I give you the hearing, I was hard to hear the reaction.
Because. Let's being honest.
What's uncomfortable when it deployed, creativity. Stimes?
This is something out of a roman.
This is something out of Patricia Highsmith.
Highsmith is one of my favorite slower.
It's the brilliant woman who was the American literature.
From her is "Two friend" and "The Talenty" and "The Talenty," and all books that are harmers who are considered by the way, and we're using our minds, and we're in the middle of the memory, and what's the memory of the memory, and that's in the
Tom Ripley, their figure.
First of all, Tom Ripley you and you have what you have, and you have, and you've got astery, and you're like from the Edbottom. He's react on your name, he's taking your suggest.
This is a method.
But what should we do? We can't do it? We can't do it.
I can't give the world, even if I'd like to do it, even if I'd like to do it.
It's a shand, because we live in a newspaper.
We live in a "eifer's doubts" time.
We're all good citizens of social media, where the choice is?
So let's look at the roman? I'm not sure.
Now, we do what Chara actors are doing when they're not sure when they're not sure in the best.
Let's go to 221 bacter Street and asked to Sherlock Holmes.
Think of people think about holmes, they think about his nemesis as a professor Moriarty, this genia, this genia, this genia.
But I've always like "Ispector<unk> Lestrade, the Chef of Scotland Yard with the face of a ratte, who needs to bring him, the holmes Geniemes, but it takes him.
That's what I'm so trust.
So the lestrade, so it takes its helped him, and it's going to be in the stories of the stories.
But when they work together, starts to change something, and finally in "The six napoleons," as a holmes income and all of his solution, and all of his solution, and they're not going to tell the holm.
We're proud."
And he's going to be there, it wouldn't be in Scotland Yard, the Sherlock Holmes didn't want to shake the hand.
This is one of the few males that we see holmes in his stories, and I find this little sky, and I think this little sense, but also, but also, it's also going to move this little bit. Stime?
It seems like six emotional, not an emotional, but a physically problem.
In a moment is holmes on another waves like Lestrade.
And in the next moment, they're on a waves.
Suddenly, it's last, it's lestrade this genius to tell him.
Is it really simple?
What if you were really trying to do is just a physically a physics? If it's just like we're just going to be involved with the other relationship?
Maybe we wouldn't have someone equipmental cells.
We could look at each other.
But I like Notfall plans.
While we were still waiting for the literature as a trost.
Literature everyone has device the effort.
Literature, it can be carrying them.
And who's all about this: the good lestrade, the good lestrade Tom Ripley, who was crazy, Marcel Proust self.
We are in extraordinary society.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I was on a camping stuff with my father in the Adirondack Gebirl, a wildness, a wildness of the state of the state of the State New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun is the blocks like the blowerful glass, and if there was no pad, and if there was no path, you could have been taken the first people who would have been able to take the first people who were going through these forest people who walk through these forests.
We came to our countries.
I saw the little hips on a clippe and blicked over a crystall crystall crystal sea, as a wonderful sea, as a little bit of a crystal.
Hinter the roof was a mouth, maybe 4 percent of the meter, with Apfel core, with Apfel ballter Aluminium following aluminiumfoly and an old Turnuh.
I was amazing, I was wished and I was awared.
The targets were too smelling, what they had brought about what they thought they thought they thought they were, they thought they were going to start?
The question was, and I found myself, and I was like.
Who is it looking for us?
How do you see it or where the "uns" also behind us who runs down to Island us in Isanbul on?
Who is running down to Rio on Rio? Or in Paris or in London?
Here in New York, the city of every day, every day, every day,000 tons of every day,000 tons of tons of tons of the tons of recycling single day.
I wanted to know them -- as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does the job.
How is it to wear a uniform and wearing these cities?
So I started a research project with them.
I went to the lashing, I love the route and interviewed people in Bure and interviewed people in the entire city, but I was still a lot of still, but I was still a lot of eyes.
I had to go.
So I took a job as a job as a job as a job.
I don't just walk with the lashing. I'm going to leave the lashing.
And I used to be the mechanical bests and plants.
It was a remarkable privileged and an experience.
Everybody asked the gest.
He's not that, but it's not as present, and we think about the days, and you're really bad, you're really quickly.
And the weight of the weight, you just hard.
I know people who made these jobs that jobs were killed. The body still remembers that they're still going to be able to weeks to weeks.
Then there's the vehicles.
After statistics of workministerium is the ministerium is the city in the city of the city in the country. And I learned why.
You're all day in the transport, everything.
Everyone wants to pick up the car, the car, the car.
That's really bad for the workers.
And the mouth is full of Gife, the mothers, the mothers and switching and shrimply.
I learned about the uncomfortable.
If you go from the board of the mouth of the mouth of the mouthwagen, you see that mothers are, you see that mothers itself.
He doesn't hear about.
It's also like a kind of a type or circulation.
He's always have to be in movement.
And then there's the stigma.
You're going to be inevisible, until someone -- which is also always being a little bit -- wished to the waves, because you're going to take a pause or a pause, or a coffeee in their coffeee in their logging and they say that they're going to come and tell them, and they're going to come
I think this stigma particularly ironic, because I think the middle of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city. That's the most important work.
They're the public health.
If they didn't remove the mouth, and efficient and effective, he would be able to found the mistakes, and the biased us to be able to remain ourselves.
Disease, we had been able to decades and centuries were under control of control, and we would send up.
The economy needs.
If we can't help the old cram, we don't have a place for the new motors of the economy, when the consumption is when the consumption.
I don't know the capitalism, I just watching the same way.
And then that's what I call our average, named, all of the pathetic speed.
So I just like, I just like quickly, we're used today.
We don't care about our coffeeeeep our tasks or our tasks or our water, or our water, or to repairs, or out.
We take them, they're going to forget them because we know that there are people on the other side of the other side of the other side.
So I want to think about today, I want to think about city, how we can think about city to improve the stigma to improve the stigma, and they can make a city and half a city and human.
Their work, I think, I think, is kind of liturgic.
You see the roads every day, you see the road.
They met in many cities.
You know, you know, you can expect them.
And their work is our work.
They're like a back-shape.
The approach that they're sustainable to us, hold us to ourselves, ourselves, ourselves, and that's going to be able to be able to behavior.
At the day after the 11th, I heard the Donner of a mouth of a mouth of a mouth, basically, basically, and ran the treps, and he was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who wonderfully, like everyone who was fully, and he went took
And I tried to him for his work, and I started to do this day, but I started to cry every day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and he said, "Alles will be good."
"All right."
And I started my news, I started my neighborhood and met the man.
His name is Paulie and we've been working on, we've been working for good friends.
I wanted to believe that Pauliety.
Everything is good.
But in our coveries that are changing the way we look at this planet as a species, we have to look at all the cost of the cost of the very human cost of the very human cost of the work.
And we had to be able to reach the people who are doing these works that we can do together, and we can think about how we think about how we can think about how we can develop the systems that we can remarkable of the streets that we can remarkable.
Instead of cities, what we think about mothers, if we talk about mothers, three percent of the national after three percent of the national after.
It's an explored statistics.
In your eye, in your life, in the air, when you see the next time you see the next time you see the next time you see a moment, you're going to take a moment, you're true.
Take a moment, you're going to make a moment.

My parents blood me to me that I'm always been able to all of the country was impossible, and my dream, and my dream, and my dream, and my dream.
And in the mind of minder of minderitary, I got a great stipendium in the ASU, the Arizona State University, because I'm sure every minority.
I was sort of the house of the challenge.
Everyone loved me.
I'm all experienced all the house of children, and I got to get all my course, in all of my course, in all of their course.
Every time I played a sense of "The Glasmazery," I was smart.
But I never got a role.
In my baby, the ASU. planted the ASU., a piece of the title of the title of the title.
A piece of a girls with CP.
I was a girl with CP.
So I'm sure everywhere, "It get a role!
I have curral paris!
Finally free! Endful.
God senteni, I'm free!"
I got the role.
Sherry Brown was the role.
I called the line of the challenge of the challenge, I'd hysterically, when I had my cat, and she said, she said, she said, she said, she said, she said, she wasn't highly not highly history.
I said, "The God, but if I can't do the stunts, then the character it can't be the character."
I was born, I was born and they gave them a challenge, and they gave a challenge without CP.
The university of life.
Hollywood is hardly known as a result of it, body is a healthy schooler body players played.
After the after the after home. My first role was a statist in a seife as a statist in a seife.

They just found people.
But the exceptions of the rule.
I grew up with Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr and Ellengs, and all of these women had a common: They were comicated.
So I became comicating comics.
My first job was, it was, it was to be a nuclear comic from New York City to Shows in New Jersey, and I'm never forget the first comics that I'll never forget that he was clearly clearly remove the streets.
I'm in Clubs all over the United States, I also have Shows in the Nahs on Arabic, unexpected and unexpected.

In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean Obeidallah, and I went to the New Yorker American Comedy Festival, which is now already 10-year-oldival,
Our goal, it was to change the negative image of American herms of American homes and to change the media and to remember the southern Arabia and Arabia and Arabia, and Arabia,
The same thing was a lot of Arabern was much easier than the challenge of the challenge of the tendency of the tendency.
My big drawing 2010.
I was a gast in the message of the news for "Country, Country Olbermann" eing.
I came like to the approach to the audiogen, they sat down to a studio and sat down me in a studio and sat down to a three-dollen studio.
So I looked at the stage, and I said, "The Germanager, I can get another stuck?"
And she looked at me and said, "Five, four, four, two.
And we were live!
So I had to table at Tish of the gast, so I had to do while I didn't look like the screen, and when the interview, and when the interviewed me.
And I was my chance, and I went took her, and I knew it, and I knew myself.
But Mr. Olbermanner, not only reading me to a valuable member, and little bit of my students and little bits.
And the work with Keith Olbermanned, I learned something tolles: All people in the Internet is Drecks.
People say, kids are graduated, but as a child or adults, someone about me.
In World Wide Web, I'm a suddenly suddenly freedom.
If I look at my cline videos, I see Kommentary, like, "Ey, how's so what?"
"Ey, that's the family?"
And my favorit: "Armer Hengelipping.
Hat they have new disease?
We should be for them."
One bad, my mind, my minds in the credits, and the credits: Drehbooks, comicatorin, cerebral paris.
A tendency is so important as the heart.
If a rolected a rolec<unk>onc<unk><unk>, you can't play a role-college,
The tendencies are the biggest -- yes. This is applause.
People are the biggest minds of the world and we are the biggest minds in the world, and we are the underporary.
The doctors said, I could never walk up here, but I can't look at this.
But I would be able to grow up with social media, I may not be here.
I hope that we can create a positive image of education in the media and in the media and in everyday.
Maybe it's less hasses in the Internet when it's more positive images.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it's still needs a village to relate a kid.
My journey with environment, I've been brought me a few places.
I thought up on the red text textbooks in the red text susan Luci and the iconic lorraine arbus.
I thought in a movie with Adam Sandler Sandler, and Idol, who work with my idol, who working with my idol, working.

But one moment that most of the most excited -- before this -- the moment that -- the moment that was the most important thing that I was intrating the man on the man on the man on the man, and how a biologist, and how a biologist, and as a bike, and I was like a bike, and I was like appeareday,
That was the only time I saw that my father ever looked at a live-time memory of me, and I went to Ged him.
: Maybe God's your sea level, Papa. My name is Maysoon Zaysoon Zaysoon Zayid, "If I can also be."
There was a time where we have big problems that we've got big problems.
At 21. Juli 1969 smaller boy in 1969 square mold Apollo 11 and stayed up to the sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were all, but their opposite on the grandface was the women, the high puncture of a counterpartment.
The Apollo-pollo-pollo-pollo-pollocation in history of the United States of America.
To to Mond to Mola, investigated NASA has about 180 billion dollars, or four percent of the center of the mine, or four percent of the bound.
Apollocator processes for 400,000 people and explored the collaboratories, companies, companies and businesses.
People start to start the best of the Apollo 1.
But until the end of the Apollo programms floating 24 people to Mond.
From the second, the surface of the surface, Aldrin, after the death of Armstrong in the last year, now the old year, now the old year.
But why did they went?
They didn't have a lot of back: 380 kilogramm old faces, and something that all 24 later -- a new sense of that our common home, and it's a new sense of small and tiny.
Why did they went? Zynically, they went to the President Kennedy, because President Kennedya, the better rockets.
But Kennedys your own words of 1962 at the Rice University University.
For apollocated at the West, not just one of the West West West West West.
For the time, the most sense of the first feeling of the Earth of the Easta, the amazing crash of technology.
They flew up to Mola because it was something grandful.
The moonelands ago, a culism of a long series of technological terriumphe.
First half of the 20th century, the flying century, and the flight, Penicillin and airplane, Penicillin and a vacculosis.
In the middle of the century were polio and the police.
Technology has been looking at what alvin Toffler 1970, a "believed an idea.
For the grandpartment of human history, we didn't quickly as a pound or a boat with segment, but in 1969, but in 1969, the management of the Apollo 10,000 miles per hours per hour.
Since 1970s were not human beings on Mond.
Nobody has been moving to be faster than the best evidence of the apollo 10, and the unknown optimism, and the power of technology is available problems that we had to solve the big problems that we had to solve the markets.
I remember that, as I remember as a five-year-old.
The same of the Apollo 17, and my mother was not too much in the case of the saturn of the Saturn-Rake vision vision.
I had a similar that this last time, but I was hundreds, but I was hundreds of mission, that it would be in my life,
The example of "etwashing with our ability to solve our ability to solve the problems with technology," is to a platform.
You hear it everywhere.
We've heard this in the last two days at TED.
It's a preventor, as if we had a technologist and even with themselves with the sounds and even with themselves, and middle. Mit Dening, like iPhones and social media, or algorithms, or algorithms, or algorithms.
It's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have our lives and we've done our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What's happened?
There's a bit of explanation from the Silicon Valley, where you're going to be less early less early less early in the last few years, in the years, in the Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Gene and Genech.
In Silicon Valley says, the markets, the markets, in the best power of the present of the businesses.
Silicon Valley says that Risicoinvestors have moved to underground ideas, which is changing ideas, and states, and states growing problems or even support problems or even support problems.
But this explanation is not good enough.
It's explained what's going to do with Silicon Valley,
Even to their risks to their risks of Risks agogenicoinvestors, little angry investments with a minute investments within 10 years.
Investors had always been mothers, rentabel in technologies like energy, which is a huge energy, which is a huge enormous evolution and the development is never been long and risky, never development.
No, the reasons we can't solve problems, we can't solve, complicated and deeply.
Sometimes we're going to be aware of the big problems.
We could fly for the Mars, if we want to fly.
NASA has been designed a plan.
But for the mars to fly a political decision of public decision of public board and that's never happened.
We're not going to fly because everyone's not going to be here on Earth, there are some important things that are going to be done.
Another time, we can't solve the big problems because our political systems.
Today, less than two percent of the energy consumption of the Earth of the Earth, he's required today, like solar energy, and biocrafts, and the reason why two percent, and the reason.
Coal and supports are green than solar energy and wind and wind and wind and windows is bill less than biocrafty.
We all want to older energyquells that are able to be able to exist. But it doesn't exist.
Now, it's so that developers, companies and economy and economy, and economy, all of the same mine, which is the same memory of the equipment of older career, and international activity.
But in the time, in the political climate change, there's no hope that the energy politics of the U.S. or the international approach and recording these memories.
Sometimes are deeply problems that technical problems that technical problems, but not that.
It was a long time that hunger was hungered on the students of life.
But 30 years of research has taught us that hunger, the hunger, the catastrophical effects that are catastrophical effects on life.
Technologies can be things like extract or systems like lagers and transportation of life, but it's going to give it, but it's going to give it, so long as you can give it.
Now, last problems are sometimes that are not going to understand the problem because we don't really understand the problem.
President Nixon explained in 1971, but you found that there are many species, but you found that there are many species of cancer, most of the circuits that most of the crossss are made of therapy, and it's been realized.
Swimming problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve with technologies.
We can have to be able to do it, but we have to be able to all of them: leaderships and the public and the public and the public, and institutions, institutions, and it's really a technical problem.
The apollomission that was to a kind of metaphor for the ability to solve the technology, big problems.
But this is a model that can't be repeating in the future.
It's not the year 1961.
There's no dramatically dramatically like the war, no politicians like John Kennedy, no politicians like John Kennedy, and no remained system, and no remaining systems like the support system.
But everyone was just to fly, it was just to fly to the moon.
He was just three days.
And it's a real problem, whether this really serious problem.
We're on ourselves, and we're going to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard.
Because God, it doesn't miss anything each other.
Thank you.
I want to end a little eyes to sleep.
Imagine you, you're standing your mainstor.
Brandchildren, their color, and the material from the material.
Now, you're a group of a group of fK-like fireler on their drivers.
It's a naked food and they come up and they come up and you get your main your main.
You have to imagine that really imagine.
They're struggled, and they're going to be directly on your drawing.
And then they all crazy, they all directly in your main.
Froms, rains, all flying, all flying and small. Speaking into the explains.
Now, the sister of your wave your wave in your wave, your flow or what your flour or what your side, your wave, and just as the side of your waves, and just as the light.
The lights up on the crushed monster.
It's what you're going to get a bunch of a grauns.
Some pounds.
You can almost late your blue fellow your blue fellow your nose.
You're rhind the shocks that it's going to be in the mouth.
Get him in your woman in your wocket.
Here's where you're going to be able to represent your imagination.
Their covery covering the covery, she singingings, "Hit Me Baby One More Time More Time Time," as they're dance.
Now, I'm going to be in your kitchen.
The ground was both of a same plant power and out of your open and out of your open, the dorothy, who are dorothy, the lions of "The America," and the lions of ozine, hiped them up.
Okay. Now, open the eyes.
I want to tell you about a very bizarren weather, which is going to tell every year in New York City,
He's called States Memory Championhip.
A few years ago, I wanted to campaign as science as science, and he expected the year, and he expecting the year.
It was a huge types and some few dames, and some dames, from all different alters and Hygienestandard.
They were picked up to after a beddle hundreds of hundreds of cities.
Larning the name of dozens and but they use the name of unknown.
and they're all the memory in just a few minutes.
They could currently being who could reflect the range of a grandfold cards at the fastest one of the most fast.
That's crazy.
These people have to have to have to have to have to have a skills.
I started to start with some of them.
This is Ed Cook, a guy who is coming out of England, and there's one of the most powerful generated generated.
And I asked him, "Ed, you've got this particular remember?"
And Ed said, "I'm not an island.
I just have average significant memory.
Everyone who's going to be there, you're going to be average, or she's just average.
We all have to train us to cover the technology, and wearing these incredible general memory, and we've been able to fully, technology that have been fully 200 years ago. This techniques that are used to be approached by the car.
And I thought, "Wow, how comes to you never heard about it?"
We stood out there, weather the weather of the weather and Ed, this wonderful, brilliant, and something excentrillian Type, "Yosh, you're a American Journalist.
Can you britney Spears?"
I said, "What? Nee. Why?"
"I would like to bring Britney Spears, like you're going to remote a grandfold cards, and Imagine. Immed to learn.
It would move the world that everyone can be here."
I said, "I'm not Britney Spears, but you couldn't tell me.
I mean, you have to start somewhere in somewhere?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
One grandpartment of the next year, I didn't just start to train my memory, but also to understand how it works to understand how it works, and how it works, and what it could be working and what it could be working and what it could be.
I really interesting a lot of interesting people.
This is the example. P.P.
He's suffering memory and it has been a bad thing that bad greathed the world.
His memory is so bad that he doesn't even remember its memory problem. What's amazing. What amazing.
Although it was so tragic, he was both of how much our memory is how much our memory is what we are.
On the other side of the spectrums, I learned.
Kim Peks.
He was the prediction for Dustin Hopman Charakter in the movie "Rain Man."
We spent afternoon together with this public books in Salt Lake City Telephone, City telephone books. It's a fascinating.
And I came back to a whole stackle Abhandles about the memory about the memory, Abhandles, the 2,000 years ago, and more than 2,000 years ago, and later in the middle of the middle.
And I've learned a whole hopefully things.
And especially, I fascinated that there was a time to train the idea that the idea of cultivate, to cultivate the memory, not to cultivate how today.
There was a time to people in their memory investigated investigated, it's investigated.
And by the last few years, we've found a series of technologies -- from technologies -- from the alphabet to the codex, to the book pressure, the book pressure, the photography, which is the smartphone -- the smartphone -- that's whatever our generalized us to doing existically
These technologies have changed our modern world, but the same time.
They have changed us to change us, and I would change us that they have changed us to change us.
Without the needs of the need to remember, sometimes it seems like this.
One of the last places of this Earth, where you can find people who are still affordable to their memory, and cultivate their memory, and cultivate, this is a single general memory.
In fact, it's not so sort of thing, there's a weather such as this extraordinary world.
And that's what I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a research group of London, College London a group of Gedmanisters in Laborator.
They wanted to know, Is the structure or anatomy of their brains as the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they clearly as we?
They gave them a stapel of cognition and the answer was, and the answer wasn't.
There was an interesting thing, and there was a lot of interesting difference between the brain of a memory of a memory and the control of a control of control.
If you put them in a fMRI machine, and you can see the brain, and their brain, as they're numbers, and images of snowers, you can see that at the memory of the brains, you can see that at the memory of the brain.
It seems like they're using the part of their memory, and it's using the range of the range of the range of the range and navigate.
Why? And we can learn from other things?
The weather campaign for the best memory is going to be a kind of weather than any year, in the world, in every year, in the new technology to a new technology to a new technology to the rest of the rest of the field and the rest of the rest of the field.
This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three times, three times.
On the table of them are 36, 36,000 maps that he's inside a stound within a technology that he's invented and as a single story, and as a single table.
He used a similar technology to relate the exact same range of 40 to four percent of 40 to a half-four half a half a half a half a half a half a half-four.
Yes.
And even though there's a computer science to technology, to make significant things in these weather, but all of these techniques, all of these techniques on the concept that psychologists called the psychologists called "aborative encoding."
That's what the baller Paradox, illustrated this concept particular coxes, and it's like, and it's like, if I was two persons, and I say two persons, and I say, "Mer, and I say, "Merker, I'm going to say, "Mer.
That's his name.
And I say, "Merk you're saying, there's a person who's a person."
If I'm going to go back to you, and I say, "We're going to go back and say, "We're going to be a less time?
You know what you're still there?"
The person who should call the person called Baller merely remembers, it remembers to be smaller probability as the person who should be remembers.
Same words, different memory, different memory, and that's collective.
What's going on here?
Well, the name balls means that you don't know anything.
He's absolutely unprected from all the memory that are in your head.
But the baller of the balls, we know balls.
Baller carrying communicating.
Balls have mistakes on their hands.
Balls running good when they come home from working home.
Maybe we're even known as a baker.
And when we hear the words, we're able to hear this asociations with the word and recognize it, and it's just recovery.
And the secrets that we have in the memory of what's going to be able to find out of the memory, and the secrets to find all the way to find is better memory to find a way to find a way to find the name.
One of the excited technology can be data for 200 years, there are 200 years back to the America.
It was called the memory of the memory.
The story of his ship is like, it's like, it was a drawing called Simonides, who was a fest moment.
He was to change the difference, because when you wanted to make a really great party, you wanted to get a great party, you didn't want to be a draw.
He's going to be the memory of the memory and loss the space. In general, and in generally the moment, and it starts together and starts together.
Not only are great, their body are until the uncomfortable.
Nobody can say who was an advantage, no one knows where who's what's healthy.
The body can't be able to be cared.
It's a tragedy to the other.
Simonides are out there, the only survival survival survival of these catastrophe. He suddenly, and suddenly, he can see that he's innoved innoved.
And so he's the connection of the hand and lead them through the tears.
In this moment, something that we all know what we all know intuitive, we all know that we all know that we're also bad news, we also know, telephone or words, telephone or words of our colleagues, we can see a very good visual and risk.
If I'm going to ask you to repeat the first 10 words of the history about Simonides, so that would find it difficult.
But I went to remember if I was to remember who would remember who was in this moment on a spoke, you could sit down in your foyerd in your foyer, then you could problem.
The idea of the idea of the poem is to build a building inner eye, and it's a building and it with images, and it's remembers -- yeah, bizarrier, bizarrier, less, the pictures, the picture is so stronger, it's so stronger, and it's so
This is a rathery that's a rather than 2,000 years old, and it's happening to the poem.
So how does it work?
You're going to get you to keeep in TED a talk to TED a talk to TEDx, and you want to hold it out of the memory, just like Cicero, it would have done to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.
You could even imagine: If you can imagine your main your main your main.
Imagine a absolutely crazy and remembered history with unexpected images to remember that you're remember that you want to talk about this greatest watching.
And then you go to your house and they're in your house and they're going to be on the back of Mr. Ed.
And that would remember that you remember, your friend Cook.
And if you want Britney Spears, they're going to tell you a luster a lustainable a luster a luster.
You go to your kitchen, and the fourth thing that you want to talk about the fourth thing that you want to talk about the dangerous journey for a year. And you've been a year. And you've got a few friends that you help you remember.
So the range of range, they're not going to be a word for word for word for words, but it's only, but it's just approach.
The English reefited "topic sentence," which is the sentence, comes from the Satz," which means "Stopos," which means "Stopos," which means "Stopos"
These are overloading about the people, when people talk about answer and rooms in rhetorically.
The formulation called "Are you're really called "An't really seriously," "An't the same thing in your community."
I found all the simple fascinating and I'm still fascinating and I'm still fascinating.
and some more important poems to fight.
I wanted to write a little longer about this subculture of competitive remembers.
But there was a problem.
The problem that the memory is that the memory of values are great forms.
It's like a group of people who are sitting there and a test.
It's already, if someone's going to be a sleep.
I'm Journalist, I need something about what I need to write about.
I know that the extraordinary things in the coast things in the coverage of these people, but I don't have access to it.
So if I wanted to tell this story, I had to try to make me in their country.
And so I started to learn every morning, before I was invited to learn to learn something out of my time.
Maybe a poem or maybe.
The name from an old year I bought up on the flohmarket.
I had to make it a lot of funny fun.
I could never imagine that never happened.
It's fun, because it's not about it because it's not about it.
You want to be better and better and better and better, these crazy, these crazy, you're going to be funny and hopefully inside your eye.
I was involved in it.
Here's where I'm a standard Gedmany called the Trainings.
A pair of Ohrister and a snower and a snow brille, which was covered on two little strips, because Abling the greatest fight of the memory of the memory.
I went to the same weather I had a year, I had a year early best.
and I sent to me, and I shared to share, just as a younalistic experiment.
It could be a nice pilog for my next challenge.
The problem was that the experiment doesn't like fly.
I won the weather campaign, which isn't really not going to happen.
It was nice, it was a present to a present and telephone and telephone and telephone, but that wasn't what I wanted to do.
These are just tricks.
Tricks the work, because they work on some simple ideas about the function of our brain.
You don't have to build a memory or your cards or your maps or your maps or your cards to make you think about the function of the function of your memory.
We often talking about people with good memory, as if it was a special regability, but that's not true.
Good memory is antrained.
We're thinking better if we're going to leave us.
We remember when we're engaged.
We remember, if we have the opportunity to find out why information and experiences, and experiences are for us to be, how they've got to look at what we can do in something to do in a way that we can use them in the other memory.
The poem is called the memory, these memory, these memory, they're all just a bit of citizens.
In fact, it's not malitories.
They work because they work to work between us.
They're working to be working and attention to be in a way that we don't have it.
But it's not a citizens.
So things are done in the memory.
And one thing I want to give you a little bit about the way that I'm going to give you a man who don't even have to be a memory of his memory, and our memory, our memory.
How much we're ready to lose our own life, and we're going to lose our blackberry or our iPhone or our iPhone or our iPhone or our iPhone, and we're going to be able to relate to relate to us? How many we're so much more we're able to relate to faceive.
I learned that the memory, in everybody from us, incredible capacity.
If we want to be a memory of life, we have to remember the person who don't understand the person who don't understand the person.
Thank you.
In the age of 27, I fellow age job in the companies of Job in the companies: until you have another strange.
A public schools in New York, I was math for you to maths.
As every teacher, I led to tests and present.
I gave house.
When the works back, I was returned nodes.
And the idea was the I<unk>n't the only difference between the best and bad students.
The I<unk>'m a few of my stronger were not stratosphary.
Some of my bad kids didn't really good at all.
That's what I think.
What you're in the 7. Schoolject in Mathe is hard: Rational numbers, Decimal numbers, the flow of a parallelogram.
But unmashly, these concepts are not. I was found that all my students could learn that all my students could learn how they worked and hard enough and hard enough.
After a few years in school, I came to the school, I came up in education that we have a much better understanding of a lot better understanding of a perspective of the motivation of the motivation of a psychological psychological perspective.
What we can measure in the best message is the best message, but what if you're in school and life from many more ability to learn more than the ability to learn how much more easily?
So I left the classroom, and I made a recording to the psychologist.
I started to children and adults in all kinds of ultra-like situation, I wondered, I wondered who was successful and why?
My research, and I went to West Point Military.
We tried to figure out what city would be city in troops with the troopment of trooping and what wouldn't.
We went to national books and we tried to figure out what children were trying to get out what kids were going to kids on the far.
We're looking at the boys who worked in very difficult to work in very difficult to work and asked, which teachers would be still under the end of the schooljects, and what they would be interesting to the learn from them to the most effective.
We sleeps with private powerful power and asked their workers, which are the working cells.
and who would be money would be money.
In all of these different contexted contexted a single economic as a couple of experience.
It wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good exploring, body wasn't I<unk>.
It was a half-intermade.
And so, increasingly, and expression and expression for very long-term.
and that's why it's sustainable.
And so that's why you're going to be a future planning planning, not just for a week or a month, but for years, and really hard to work for years, and really hard to make this plan.
And so, increasingly life as a marathon, not sprint.
And a few time, I started to reach in Chicago Dhrough a half a half available.
I asked thousands of the under secondary question of the skills to see a year, and then I waiting for a year to see who was doing a year to see who made the a year to see who made the a year.
It turned out that kids with higher deal with higher definitely, probably the appearance, even if I'm all messages, even if I all might be able to recognize things like families, like families, like families, like the tests.
So in terms of counting, so it's not just in Westpoint and books, but also in school, in school, especially for kids with Abrisico.
The exciting thing about this is that we know that we know that we know that the science is so little knowledge about how to know how to build it.
Every day, I asked me parents and teachers, "How do we understand the audience of children?"
How do I live a children of working on this?
How did I hold her for Distancial?"
The real answer: I don't know.
But what I know is that you're not a dalenter of all,
Our data shows that many talent people are not simply not talent people don't just turned to be a tremendous.
In fact, the average is after our explanation, not after our exploration, but correlated, but correlated inversation with Talentalent.
And so the best idea that I've heard about the best idea of deforestation of a half of a half-consorient provided institution.
This idea was developed in the Stanford University of Carol Dweck and to recover the surveillance is not function that the ability to learn that they can't change your insight.
Dr. Dweck has gone that children when they learn about the brain and learning how it's like answer to change the answer, and growing up in variously, because they don't believe that they don't believe that they don't believe that variously a permanent.
This growth is a great idea is a great idea of deading idea of dealing with a deal with a deal with a half of deficient.
But we need more.
Here's what I want to do is, we're now going to be so far.
That's the work that we are.
We have to keep our best ideas and strong intuitions.
We need to be able to have to be able to have to be able to have to be able to learn to learn to learn to learn from learning and from the lessons.
In other words, we need to give us a half-interests, our children more delivers.
Thank you.
In the center of my work is the connection of transmission of translationships and part of our community and part of the environment, local conditions, local conditions.
Today, I have an example of this, ...
Both projects are in Swells, one in Ethiopia and one in Tunesia and one in Tunesia.
They also have common that the different analysis of analysis of different perspective perspective part of the final architecture.
The first example, I started to deal with an income, a more powerful ethiopia in Ethiopia, Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis Adis.
This is the kind of buildings that we should be, and I was as an example of what we should be designed.
First of all, I thought I wanted to walk.
After we saw a few of these buildings -- there are many of them -- there are many of them in the city -- we realized that they have three went to have three went to have three went.
First, these buildings are almost because they can't suffering in the countries, in the people who can't sell things.
Secondly, they need a lot of energy because the surface of glass, which is what hits are inside the inner, and then you need a lot of cool.
In a city that doesn't happen to be able to do because they have quite mild watched in the entire year between 20 to 25 degrees.
And thirds had nothing to do with Africa and <unk>thiopia and <unk>thiopia.
This is a place with a place with a place with a such culture and tradition.
And I was in our first setting, I was really extraction of the old market with this free market with this fascinated, where thousands of people hing and a house of people, and a little hands.
It also has this idea of public space that are using the outside of the outside to create activity.
So I thought that's exactly what I really want to do is not a shopping mall.
But the question was, how we could deal with this principles, carrying with these principles.
The next challenge came out when we looked at the reason, because it's in a real growth, because it's in a real growth, in the city of the city that you're not there.
It's because it's two parallelstreams that have no connection.
And when we looked at a connection between these two streets, and we'd all empty to the buildings.
This is now in a genected at a genecius, which is a free-reed room in the building room, who's created by his own form itself and rainforests.
So to the carbon room, we sent the idea of a market with little country that are changing in every etage, because of the shape of the hole of the hole.
I also think, how do we survived the building?
I really wanted to find a solution that reacts on the local climate change.
I started thinking about textilies, like a shal from Beton with perforations, which is the air, and the air, but the air, and the light, but in the air.
Then I was inspired me to the bad grandchildren, and they're anthiopic women.
They have the own capital geometry and the half the whole fire created fire.
We build this little bit of these little bits, we build the windows, the air, the air, and light on controls, and light on the buildings.
and that's going to be able to use these little bits, the lights that light out of the buildings to use the buildings to remain the building.
It wasn't just the big memory with these ideas that ideas, because they thought, "Thopping Mall. That's not a shopping mall.
But then we all explained that these idea of the market is much profitable than the idea of a left of a left of a left, because they can sell more later.
And so the concept of the fassade was much, much, much, not just because of the materials with glass, but because we don't need a climate change more climate.
So let's look at some cost of costs that we used to realize the project.
The first environment was to think about how we could make the building energy, how we could make the building energy that has almost during the city.
We're looking at a valuable bag, by slar panel on the roof.
And we started this panels, we found the new public space with a new public space with a new public space, and Bars, and Bars.
These voice on the roofs, the water to the water to the water to the sanitary angry.
Hopefully, because we have the next year, because we have the construction to 5. Stocks.
The second example is a masterplane for 2,000 choice and institutions in Tunis.
So to create a big project that I had to do the biggest project that I had ever been designed the city I had to understand the city, but also the city, I had to understand the culture.
While this analyse, I went to the medina, which is the 1,000 years old structure that was 1,000 years old structure, and through 12 days, and through almost during lines.
When I went back to the first step, the first steps that were the best streets to create the first 12 bubble to create the first 12 bubble, with similar size and economy and in other ecopean cities like the barcelona and in other cities.
And we choose some strategic punctic punks in a number of this tore and spent the concept of this tore and spent the original patterns.
The last step was thinking about the cell, the cell, the little cell of the project, like the project, as a wonderful part of the Masterplans.
What would be the best exciting in a mediterran Klima for a wohn?
This is North South, on the temperature of the temperature between the two house, and it's going to create a natural deliveration.
So let's start to think about this, that most of the most important choice of perfect in these direction.
And that's the result, it's almost like a combination of an european bubble and the Arabic city.
There are the blocks with high and in the Earth and in the memory for footprints for footprints.
It also requires the same prediction that a higher distribution in the own engaged Etagen and a lower distribution in the Earth.
It also understand the concept of the tore.
The volume that has available form that self-driveness, and they're going to be able to do it, and they're also built in very distribution in the world, and inside the inside of the innerabilities like the inside of the inner.
The thing that I think my favorite sort of this project, the community of the community, who's going to be building from the building.
There can all neighbors and come up and make things like a 2-comm-colleague on the morning, from a building.
These two examples have a common slow answer together.
They're in schools, in the cities that you can see the cities that you can see.
In these cities, the effects of architecture in the architecture of the people of the local communities and economy and economics systems like the buildings.
And so, I think it's important that architecture, but in facture, but increasing solutions that are relationship between the relationship between the environment and the environment and people to connect the environment.
Thank you.
I want to talk about trusting to talk about trusting to the long memories about trust.
They're so expecting that they're gone to the cliffs.
There's my view, there's my view.
First of all, a memory: trust believe in the back, a lot of time.
Then a goal: We should be trusted more.
And one of the job: We should be able to build the trust.
I think the target that the target, and the goal and the targets.
I want to tell you a different story about a target, and I want to tell you a lot better another path that has a much better answer.
It's the mind: Why people think that trust behind the trust?
And if I really think about my actual knowledge about this: I don't know the answer.
Maybe it has ever been in some activities or in some activities, and in other maybe.
I think the mission of the translated.
But I can look at the environment that are the environment that are the source of the source of the belief that the belief.
Look at the memory of a memory about a time, not a lot of evidence of movement.
Socuse is going to be the people who were being remarkable, the people who were just Journalists and politicians, still miser, still miser.
And the people who were trusted in 20 years ago, it's still very disease: Richtern, Crank human beings.
We're all sorts of the way. We're in the average, the average.
But is that a good evidence?
My dreams -- clear -- clear -- mine.
What could they reach them?
So they look at the community of people who are being certainly when they're asked questions.
Do you trust politicians? Is you teach teachers?
If you're asking you, you know, you know, you know?
Do you want to change fish?
Do you want to reason?
And then -- then you'd asking, "Inwiefs?"
And that would be a future reaction.
And if you understand the answer, you might say, "I'm trust some of them, but not."
It's a great rational.
And we're trying to try to reduce our lives, trust to bring in different ways.
We don't go out of that we're not going to be each constitution or institutional or institutional institutional institutional institutional.
So I could say that I could say that I was a particular reason, I could go to the first reason, and I would go to the first classroom, but I wouldn't read the first classroom.
Maybe I know that they don't know that they don't know good cars.
I'm trusted that my swatzing friends, I think that my friend of a conversation, but maybe not being a secret.
Simple.
So we know from our eye, how different trust behind our applications, but how do we look like this knowledge, we're abstract the trust?
The environment here is very bad exciting about the fact that they actually ignored, because they ignore people, because they ignore the whole people in the relative.
Secondly, we come to the goal.
The goal is to trust more to trust.
And I said, I think that's what I think is.
And I wouldn't go to play.
I would try to try to trust the trust, the trust, the trust, the trust, but not.
I'm so extractive it, trust to trust trust to understand the violence.
And the ones that are countered. It's a certain metr. Madoffe, and then the madoff, and then the name is, and then the name thing to do with the stuff, "They" -- "That's a lot of trust.
"More trust trust is not a clip in this life.
Dust be clearly a single stuff and to be covered to be the goal.
And then you say, yes, okay, so the most important thing is not trusting to trust.
The trust of people can make a difference of people.
And to do that, we have to do three things.
Are they completely? Sind them? Sind them? Sind them?
If we're going to find a person in the decisions, and actually find a good reason, and then we've got a good reason, then we've got a good reason, then it's crazy.
But the person but inevitable, then you probably don't.
Some of my friends are completely, and I wouldn't be a letter, but they're not a broad, because they're a lot of the letters.
I have friends that very in their own competitors, but they're trusting to make it a little bit about a bit.
And I'm very happy about that I don't have a lot of friends that I've been losing, but in fact,
If I didn't explain it.
But we look at this: we're looking forward, then we're trust.
Doesponding is the reaction.
The trustriality we have to have a value. That's hard.
We've been able to try to try to try to control systems in all sorts of systems and experts and experts and experts that make us a single parent.
Many of these systems have the opposite effect.
They don't work like the most important thing.
A homebamm said to me, "That problem is that the paper cramping longer than the baby on the world."
All of all, in our public alltag, in our public effects, and this problem. This is a problem. This is supposed to believe, and it's opportunity, but for opportunity.
It's like hebs from their hard boxes, by their half approaching half away from their sketting.
Here's a sure of every examples.
So much for the goal.
The goal is more confidence, and that's difficult, and that's going to be hard to be abused and the other communicate and if we want to be a different people, and if we want to be approached or politicians, or politicians, or politicians,
It's not easy. You have to decide. It's not a simplications or halties.
And now, now,
This is as a writing of the trust of trusting to describe the thing that's going to be repeat.
Because it's defined that you should be building.
We can do that, of course, we can do itself.
We can win a little bit of trustriality.
So, you can make two people in your trust.
But finally, it's trusting to characterized that it's going to be a different from other.
You can't look at what other people are going to give you another.
You have to give them a basis that they have to give you a basis.
So you have to be remarkable.
And of course, that you can't turn to all people in the nose of the nose of the nose.
But you have to bring evidence that you're trusted to be regular.
How does that?
This is what happens every day, every day, every day, we do it, well, public, very effective.
Here's a simple commercial example.
The laden I buy my son, I'm going to buy my son, and they don't ask me back and they ask me.
They take them back and give me the money, or a few of the same songs of the same color.
That's great. I'm sure them, because they've been created to me.
Darin is a important moral.
And you're sure that you're a very good handledge, that's a very good hard, and that you're using your own words, and that you're going to believe your own words.
So our goal is not very difficult to see very difficult to see.
It's relationship between people, and the involved people, and the involved, and whether the other people, and whether the other.
So the moral of story is very less than trusting to think about trusting to think about constitutions, or constitutions that are correct or incorrect or incorrect or increased, and much more about consideration, and how to requirements and easily, and how you're easily and just as you
Thank you.
You know, the best thing that I can look at the films that I can look at the films I can look at the films I can look at the films.
I love my own love with my own love with my kids with my children. When my daughter four years old, we've been looking at the <unk>11, we've looked at the ozine.
The movie, she didn't left.
Your favorite graduate was natural glinda.
So she had a good exciting, a glad carrying carbon and a magic clean stables.
But if you look at this moviews enough, you realized how extraordinary.
We live in the day and we're living our children in a speectacular children in a specular children's great.
But "The America was different.
He didn't have this trend.
It has 40 years, until this trends up until this trends, with -- interestingly, with another film, in a guy, and a girl, and a girl, and a girls, by the watching of the fashion of the fast of the fast.
You know where I'm talking, right?
Good.
Now there's a big difference between these two films, even more differences between these two films of ozine between "The Az," and all the films that we look like this.
First of all, there's a magic of Oz," very little violence.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the apple box.
But I think if "The America's produced by Oz," which would have been produced by the magic, you would have said, "Torothy, you're the rocketter of Oz, you're a prophected us.
Benefit your magical shoes to create the computers of the computers of the bad species of the West.
But that's not what happens.
Another point I think, the "The I'm going to be a very unique," is that the helping and clearly never been able to help and even nevertheless, and even nevertheless.
And I realized the first time I was remarked when I was created my daughter, which was a year later, and the situation was different.
For a young time, I had a son.
He was just a time, he was just three years old.
He wasn't a little bit of this cinoa. It wasn't a young.
But he was the second child, and he was less than his sister.
So he's a sure, and he's covered the movie, how a piece of his mother, and I don't think he's not understood that he was involved, but he's been sured out what it was quite sured.
And I asked me what he's going on.
Hat he's still snapped that it's about mut, maybe it's about mutrity?
Hat he was snapped that Luke a army of army to start to start the government?
Hating the moment, and that's only boys in the universe, and of course, and of course, and of cool is really cool, but while the real time, but while the most cool, but while they were just waiting the high-willed.
Compare that with "The America of Oz" by 1939.
How do you bring the phymany to a good end?
Indeed them to all of them, and it's an invited.
This is the way that I would like my kids I love my kids -- Oz, right? -- and not in the world, right? -- and not in the world, what's so pretty much of our world.
Why are there so much power -- big power -- in the movies that are for our children, and so few money?
There's a lot of good literature about the impact of the implusion that films have been girls on girls, and they should read.
But I didn't have so much about how boys with this influence with this influence.
I know that principle experience that princesses, Princess Leia, I couldn't have the adults that I could have been used to find through the world of the world, in the world of the world, and Junger.
I think there was this moment with this moment with the first kuss, when I realized that the first cussion that the aspanned, because that's so ended up a movie, right?
I've been talking about my mission, I've got the girl.
Why are you still out there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are very excited to bring the bads and the bad and its birds and its birds, and there's no risks and other relationships and other relationships.
It's almost as if you're a young boy, and when you're a girl, you should be better, you should be better.
There's a lot of exception and I'm going to take the discovery principles of you.
But they give a message that the young boys are not the boys are not the goal.
They're fabulously remembers that girls, like they can use the patriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarchatriarch.
There's no idea for them.
There are some grandiose women who write new stories for our children and so three-dimensional and wonderful hermine and catnissional and catnisms.
And the first studio of all the time, of course, of course, of course, and every single time, and every single one of them, or one of the journey of the journey, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, or two men, and his sones, or
Bis -- like many of you think about this year -- to this year when they think about this year when they finally film "Merida -- Legenerida -- Legenerating.
I'm going to tell you all. He's in the Internet.
Rememember what the criticians said, "Merida"?
"Ah, I can't believe that Pixar a princess called a princess."
He's very good. Let's not there.
But as good as well as a part of these movies has the test.
I don't know if you heard about it.
He's not so bigger than that, and it's not going to be a movement, but maybe we're going to be a movement.
Alison example is a compic book-Autorin and has been in the middle of the 80s, these difference that they had seen with a friend of the films that they had seen before they saw.
It's just simple. There's only three questions that you need more than a character in the film, and something says, and something says?
Try after that prediction to replace this idea.
And they talk to some women to someone each other?
And it's about their difference to something else than the climbing, and they want to pick the clips?
Do you know? Thank you.
Thank you.
Two women who exists and talk to each other,
So something happens. I've seen it, and I see it, I see it quite simple, I see it in the movies that we know and love.
In fact, I'm going to look at this week, took a very good film.
You remember? We remember the Oscars, great uncars, a general piece of what a general surveillance about what a good hollywoodfilm.
He falls with white farmers, by the six.
I think that shouldn't think that's a grandmes -- I don't know if you saw him if you saw him -- but a grandmes in a both of the film, in a men and women areas, in the men and women areas.
There's some good sense, in the men in this conversation, in this conversation, from angry and the great moment, and the great moment, and the great moment, and say, "Coment," and say, "Commstery?"
So imagine some hollywood.
So let's take a look at the numbers.
In 2011, under the 100 popular films, what you think you've actually had a female harmers?
Elf. That's not a remote.
It's not so many protects like the number of women we've just been in the Congress, so it's good.
But there's a number that's bigger than this room, and that's going to be a little bit.
Last year, the New York Times a study that has published the government.
It's like that.
It's a five women in the United States, they've been ready to be sexual.
I don't think that the shoes of all the support of the entertainment culture.
I don't think that children are somewhating.
I don't think that musicvideo and Pornography and pornography, but something that's something that I think, but something that statistics are highly highly highly high-stractionalistics.
Who are these guys? What are they learning?
What are they don't create?
Take them in the story that it's the story of a men who is a men who is to bring the short rest of violence and then the belohn, which is a woman who has no friends that doesn't talk about?
Let's take this story?
You know, as a parent that's parents, the privileged, a daughter, just as the young, just as the same thing we're doing this world, and we want to do that, and we want to do that.
We have compassion like "Mypower" and we hope that the helpower, but I'm also asked me whether they're going to be able to protective or what happens when we're going to take our sons, our sons, our sonsides, and they're going to turn their hypower.
The Netflix Wartix Wart, a middle that we can do something very important, and I'm talking about the variety.
I think we have to record our sons, we have to make a new definition of men.
The definition of men's already to change.
They've left, like the New Economy, the role of house and brilliants.
They're going to be affected by each other.
Our sons are going to find a way to find a way to make a new relationship with each other relationship with each other, and I think we need to show them that a real man who are really trust to show them that someone who wants to be respect and respect themselves and respect themselves and they really want to ask them to ask them to be, and they'
I think we should be able to look at the netflix we're looking for films that are going to find the best, and if we can find them, and we can find them together, and we can see the same money, and we can bring our skills and our skills.
When I asked my daughter, who was their loved in "Star Wars" since you know what they said?
Obi-Wan.
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
What have these two common?
Maybe it's not just the glad.
I think these two figures are experts.
These are the two characters in the movie that are more than all other people knowledge, and their knowledge to help them to help them to help them to help them to help them.
And then they're leadership.
I'm like this kind of a task for my daughter and give me the kind of air, and I give you the son.
I want to leave more attention like this.
I want to be less embracted in my son, and I said, "They," and I'm going to go to the care of all, and more a team, and more attaching a team that he's going to help another, maybe one team that will help you to help people to help people to help people to help people to help people to hel
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about the story of a clinstadtal.
I don't know his name, but his name, because it's his story.
He lives in a small village in the south of South Somalias.
His village is in the narrative of Mogadian.
The door is caused the poverty of this village and the village of the village.
When it wasn't anything that he was him, he was going to be able to the city, and he went into this case, Mogadian, Mogadias.
When he gets there, there's no way there's no way to work, no work, no evidence.
And he's going to come in a mager in a mager of Mogadianu.
It maybe a year, but nothing.
One day, he's going to be a man wholed by a man who guy who's after the night, then for the middle of the middle.
He's true that dynamic group of young people and give them a chance.
He gets a little money to buy new clothes and buy new clothes and to buy their family.
It's going to be the young woman.
Finally, he's married.
He starts a new life.
His life has a sense.
At a bad day in Mogadicu, under a carbon, under the autobombs in the air.
This city city city with grandchildren with grandmother, the self-morders and bombs and bombs and these dynamic group, a terrorganization with connections with connections.
How could the story of a clinstadtal city that just tried to simply tried to use the grandforest city to remember the air, and in the air.
He had waited.
He had been waiting for a opportunity to the future, and it was the first opportunity, and it was the first opportunity that he was both.
It was the first thing that we called him out of a condition that we call "Waithood"
And his story repeates over again, over again, and over again,
It's the story of the story of the story, working in Johannesburg and London United States and London Unruction and London United Streburg and after a birth.
Now, people are spoken by the city, from their grandforest city, maybe opportunities, but young people have no answer, but young people have no answer their cities.
Of the time, it's the young people who are suffering.
In 2030,000 people will be three of five in the cities in the cities of the cities.
If we don't know that the growth of the cities, if we don't have a possibilities, then we'll be able to terrorism, which is in the terrorism, in the violence of 20 feet.
In my buildings, Mogadian, Mogadian, 70 percent of the young people under working under work.
70 percent of the work, don't go to school.
They don't do anything.
Last months I'm back to Mogadianu and I went to Madina Crankenhouse, where I was born.
I remember how I was in front of this quick disease and I asked me what if I asked me when I'd never been asking from here?
What if I won't being the same state of the "Waithood"?
If I won't waiting to the terrorist?
I'm not sure what I should be answer.
The reason for my jobs for my month in Mogadian was actually the exciting of a gip of a gipful for young leadership and entrepreneurs.
I brought about 90 Junge Baldian leadership.
We sat down together and we made a brinstorming for the largest challenges for the largest challenges of their city.
In space, a young man, Adenden.
He was besting the university in Mogadian and made his applius.
There was no work and no ways and no ways.
I remember how he said he was that he said that he had a university, working on a university, and frustrated, the perfect goal, members of old-Shabaabaaba and other terrorizations.
They looked like him.
But this story is a different course.
In Mogadicues are the biggest hinders to B to B to B to B.
Two years of citizens have the street system of the street system, so that the best food is the best movement.
And then the opportunity and explore it.
He opened a motorcycle.
He started to get motorries to place the place that they couldn't easy to sun.
With the help of his family and friends, he buy 10 motorries and hearing its business, and hearing its businesses in the next three years.
How do these story of the other?
What does the difference?
I think it's his ability to recognize a new opportunity to use a new opportunity.
It's the entrepreneurs and I believe that company we've been able to believe "Waithood"
It's the young people to create the economic chances that they're looking at social chances.
You can teach people to be able to be able to be invisible.
I want to talk to you about a young man who was participant on one of my ocean: Mohamoud, Mohamoud, a river.
He helped me to me, the company of a young people who are participating the gipfels and show them how to show them how to show them how to innovative and entrepreneurs.
He's actually the first river, the first florist, the Mogadianu since 22 years ago, and until Kurzem, before Mohamed there was a perfectly came out of the per school, if you want to be affected by the extraction.
If you ask someone said, "When you've seen the last time you saw the last time?" then the answer of many, who was the answer of the citizens of the citizens, "No one."
So Mohamed a opportunity.
He found a country of landscape with blumblums.
He was a plantage, a plantage, and he started to cover tulpes and liles and lilies, and lilies, like he said, in the outside of the climate change climate Mogadianus.
He started to flying high-time, and he started private gardens and stories and stories around the city and he worked around the city of the first parking public parks in Mogan Mogaduitude in Mogaduitude 22 years.
There's no public parks in Mogadian.
He wants to create a place where families and young people come together and how he says that can be harms of life.
Just like the Rande: He's not a rose because they need to have a lot of water.
So the first step is, young people inspire people inspire, and in this room had Mohameds of the reason, and in the other young people in the room.
They had never thought about it, a companies.
They thought about it, for a NGO to work or for government, but this story, his innovation, his innovation, and they had a strong confluence.
He came up their city as a place to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
He remarkable, they can be cared to be able to bring the change.
And at the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges of their city.
They had until they had increases for local problems.
The inspiration young people and the pollution of a company, but the big step, but you need capital, but you need capital to make capital to make their ideas.
They need things to make things and support and support to develop them to develop their business and start to start to start.
Bring young people with the resources that they need to take the resources that they need to give them the difference they need the difference that they need to use ideas that they will be able to use catalysatories for struggle.
For means that means more than just the reasons of a business.
It's about the effects social effects.
Mohamed doesn't just selling blowers.
I think he's selling hope.
His such as a free-park" is when he's created the view of people in their city.
Aden has streets of embracted to help him the motorries and instands.
He gave them the chance that chance to come from the "Waithood"
These young companies have a huge impact on their cities.
So my prediction is, young people to companies, young people, and they're going to leave their own innovations and you will get more stories about blowers and "Face" and "Face" and "Wood" and "Wood" and "Wood" and "Wood"
Thank you.
While my childhood in Maine was one of my favorite businesses, after Sanddollars to look at the coast of Maine, because my parents, because my parents.
But these muschles are hard to find.
They're from Sandwitching, coffee.
But after a certain time, I had a routine.
I started looking at foots, and patterns that help me.
And that's developed to find things that we can find things to find things to a love for past and the archology.
And when I started to study optologyptology, I realized that the search that the search with my block.
Because suddenly went to the Egyptian street in Maine Street in Maine, and I'm going to long the nils, and my sanddollars. And my sanddollars.
That led me to use satellite satellite images.
I had to see the past, to see the past,
I want to show you how we use instantly differently when we use infrarothes.
This is a piece that's an eastern Egyptian dolphins called Mendes.
And the patterns have been able to use it. We use infrarot, but infrarot, and we're working with false, this state, and that's going to be able to have a highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly
What you see here, the chemical chemical change of the country of the country and --activities of the old <unk>gypters.
What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite satellite a oldgyptical city to find a older, which was a name of years, and for thousands of years.
It was the mainstaddy was the mainstadt of the altitude, more than four years ago, in a hundred years ago, in a hundred years ago.
The state is in the Egyptian Al-Fayyum and it's very condition because it's very condition for older regyptical architecture and religion for older, architecture and religion.
<unk>gyptologists knew that the state of Itj-yptologency of Itj-yramids in the narrative of the pyramid, and there's two kings, but somewhere in this massive switches.
This area is huge -- the flow -- the flower is four times four times.
From the flying of the Nilian directly on the Ej-year-old, and while it changed the city of the city, and he was above the city.
So as you find a city in a city in one of the city in one of the particular city.
They're going to find the quivalent of the quivalent of the equivalent to find the nadel in the home, with connected eyes and baseball-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-exclift
So we used NASAs Typographypography to see a map of the country of country to see a country to see through a country.
where the course of the nils early.
But you see exactly what's very interesting, and that's very interesting, and it's very interesting to the circle, which is a position for the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city.
So we're working with egyptical scientists together together together together, which you can see here.
This is like Hocor carbon in the ice, just instead of the climate change, the climate change, you look at the human beings, you look at the human beings.
In a deepth of five meters, under a thick slow slowly, we found a thick of tons.
This shows that this position for Itj-taui, in five meters, we can find a hundred years, we can find a hundred years, we can find a hundred years to find a hundred years to exactly the exact same exactly the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence.
We found outside, we found a career -- carenolor, and Achat -- which shows you that here has a juwelier.
That's not what it looks like, but if you look at the longest set of Juwels who were used by Juwels in the middle of Juwels.
So we found a thick of the piece of the piece of this state, which is on the middle of the middle of the middle.
We also found evidence for a juwels for the goals of society that this is a very important city, which is a very important city.
It's not a project there, but we're going to show you this state, but we're going to show a map.
What's important is that we're going to be felt for youngypters that are going to be able to be able to do so that they're the ones that they're the same discoveries.
So I wanted to wanted to my favorite sitting in the middle of Middle Ej-year-old, maybe in the city of Itj-taught.
"You know, you know, the biggest biggests.
There's no same in the country."
TED wasn't in 1984. Chr. Chr.
But in 1984, but in 1984, but in 1984. Chr. Chr. Chr.
You can see that the muschels are basically compared to the streets.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I grew up in Taiwan as a daughter of a case. Two my beautiful memory, like my mother, like my mother, the beauty and the form of Chinese school.
Since I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a moment, it seems like the grandmother of China.
In the last years, I asked myself, I can ask this magazine, so that everyone who has learned to this complex language, and they're learning.
I thought that a new fast method, Chinese method, Chinese, nice.
I learned the five. I learned every single stress for every single stress in the right each steps in the right each steps.
In the next 15 years, I learned every day, I learned every day.
And we only have 5 minutes to have a faster and just a faster and just a faster and easy method.
A Chinese area, 20,000 powerful cade.
They just need 1,000 powerful for a simple simple scripture.
The most important 200 percent of you, 40 percent of the simple literature -- enough to streets, spectaces, spectaces, and the bottoms, or time.
Today, I begin with eight signs to show you how the methods works.
Are you ready?
If you're open your mouth, until it's possible.
And that's going to be a mouth."
This human beings areazing.
"Man".
If the Umrission for "Fewers" a human arms, as if he was like, "Hilf! I'm going to be a bridge!" I'm bridge. That's available of the form of the form of the form of forms.
This is a tree.
"Baum."
This is a "Berg."
The "Sonne."
The "Mond."
The shrifice for "Tur" looks like a saloont of the West.
These eight business are Radical.
They're the reason to make a variety of signs.
A human beings.
If someone thought, then it means "fold."
Are there more, then it means two "Begleitation" and three a "manmances."
If a human army, then, this human says, "It's so 'There's so 'The was so 'T.
The human in the mouth, he's like eing.
He's a Gefan," like Jonas in the forest.
A tree is a tree. Two trees. Two trees for a "We're going to be a "Wek."
Three together for a wall for a wall.
Sett you put a plane, and you have a "Basis."
You're going to take a mouth, it means "idiotic."
Simplifying because a speaker bacy is idiotically idiotic.
Rememember the fire?
Two flames, two flying operating,
Three fire collapsed many "Flam."
Setting the fire, you're going to be burning it "burns."
For us is the sun, the sun, the sun.
Two suns together, "where."
Three of them are "Funking."
If the sun, and the moon and the moon, it means "Hellity."
In the next day, it can also be drawing for the next day.
The sun is about the horizon: Suns.
To. A breads in the door, for the door.
Platzing a mouth in the door, it means, "Fraw."
Clopf, clip. Isn't it?
These person seems like the door. "flow."
Links is the "Fraw."
Two women together for a "Streit."
And then, for three women: that's called "Ehebrary."
We now have 30 signs of the processes.
With this method, you can get out of the first eight radicals.
The next group with eight businesses with eight signs.
With a little bit of anxiety, you can learn a few hundreds of signs, like a eight-year-old child.
If we can start to consumpt them, we start together.
For example, he gives berg and fire and fire, so a "Vulkan."
We know Japan is the country of the country.
This is the sun, the Sun," because Japan <unk>apan <unk>1.
A sun with the original suns with the Ur.Japan."
A human behind Japan?
All right, "Japaner."
The writers are two business are two businesses.
In the classic Chinese Chinese chinese caiser, because Chinese caiser caiser caiser in Exily,
Today, "Exil" today."
One mouth who says where it's going to be out of "Ausgang."
This is the follow me to remind me to leave me to leave the stage. Thank you.
